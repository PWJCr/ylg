Guillotine cutting is used to cut the fiberboard into large sheets (for example 100 inches wide). For smaller sheet sizes such as 42 by 49 in (107 by 125 cm), die cutting is used. Specialty machines are used for cutting fiberboard into narrow strips of 1-24 in (2.5 -61 cm) widths.

## How corrugated cardboard is made - material, manufacture, making, used 
After pulping and other processing, the fibers are sent directly to the paper machine where they are formed, pressed, dried, and rolled into the wide, heavy rolls of kraft paper sent to corrugating plants to be made into cardboard. At the corrugating plant, only a few other raw materials are needed to make a finished box.

## Fibreboard means wet process as well as dry - Wood Based Panels
The fibreboard market is dominated by MDF-type products. Such products are normally made via the 'dry process', which means that the fibres are dried prior to being formed into a mattress that is subsequently hot-pressed. MDF is, however, a relative newcomer to the market compared to other fibreboards as the very first fibreboard products
