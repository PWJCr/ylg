## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Jaw Crushers Work A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.

## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.

A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881. Thomas A. Edison also designed a rock crusher to use in his own mining operation. Edison's design used giant rolls to function as a primary crusher. These machines never gained much popularity though because the gyratory and jaw crushers were more versatile.

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

## Jaw and Impact Crusher Maintenance - RR Equipment
I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing.

If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.
