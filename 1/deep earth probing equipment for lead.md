## Probing materials at deep-Earth conditions to decipher Earth's 
Now, scientists have developed a way to study liquid silicates at the extreme conditions found in the core-mantle boundary. This could lead to a better understanding of the Earth's early molten days, which could even extend to other rocky planets. The research was led by scientists Guillaume Morard and Alessandra Ravasio.

The challenge for mantle geochemists is to integrate their observations with those of geophysicists and progress is slowly being made in this respect. White, W. M. (2015). Probing the Earth's Deep Interior through Geochemistry.
