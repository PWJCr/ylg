## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

## Is Limestone a Good Building Material?
Limestone Has Dependability Limestone is one of the most durable options out of all building materials. It's strong and dense, and contains few pores. Less pores make it harder for the stone to break, and allow it to withstand abrasion and freeze-thaw. It's also weather resistant, making it the perfect option no matter the climate you're in.

## Radon
Radon has no stable isotopes.Thirty-nine radioactive isotopes have been characterized, with atomic masses ranging from 193 to 231. The most stable isotope is 222 Rn, which is a decay product of 226 Ra, a decay product of 238 U. A trace amount of the (highly unstable) isotope 218 Rn is also among the daughters of 222 Rn.. Three other radon isotopes have a half-life of over an hour: 211 Rn, 210
