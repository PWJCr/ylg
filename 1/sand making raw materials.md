Since the aggregate processed by the cone crusher contains a large number of needle flakes, an impact sand-making machine is configured. The materials processed by the impact sand-making machine have a more uniform particle size and a good crushing effect.

## How is glass produced from raw materials? - A Plus Topper
The raw material for making glass is sand ( silicon dioxide or silica) which is abundant in the Earth's crust. Glass is formed when silicon dioxide is melted and mixed with other substances like lead (II) oxide, boron oxide, sodium carbonate or calcium carbonate. Generally, glass can be made by heating a mixture of silicon dioxide and metal

## Sand in short supply - BASF
We are now looking for ways to make better use of the resources. One of these methods has been in use since 2016: a process developed by BASF to convert sand that was previously unsuitable for high-quality concrete into a valuable raw material. This involves using clayey sand or sand with a high proportion of ultra-fine additives, such as mica.

## What Raw Materials Are Used in Glass Making?
There are four main raw materials used to make glass: silica sand, soda ash, dolomite and limestone. In many cases, broken pieces of glass called cullet are also added to these raw materials to help them properly melt when heated. There are a number of different ways to make glass, depending on the desired finished product.
