## How to Stop Condensation in Garage - Garage Expert
It occurs when water vapor condenses into liquid form inside the garage. The result is a wet floor and a mess. If you live in an area where there is a lot of humidity, then you might notice that your garage has a tendency to get damp.  When water evaporates from the concrete, it carries minerals with it as it travels through the concrete.

"Cement hydrates are small, on the nanoscale scale," says Tingtao Zhou, a PhD student in the Department of Physics and the lead author of the paper. "These are the building blocks of cement." During cement hydration, the cement hydrate's nanograins aggregate with each other, forming a network that glues all constituents together.

Cement discharge temperature should be kept below about 110 o C but, the same time should allow some 60% dehydration of gypsum to optimize cement strength without excessive false set. Water spray is controlled with mill outlet gas or material temperature. A hardware interlock is recommended with mill main drive to avoid accidental spray in mill.
