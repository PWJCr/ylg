It was generally believed that coal sources are not favorable as live-in habitats for microorganisms due to their recalcitrant chemical nature and negligible decomposition. However, accumulating evidence has revealed the presence of diverse microbial groups in coal environments and their significant metabolic role in coal biogeochemical dynamics and ecosystem functioning.

mines, strip mines or tailing piles. Most discussions on acid mine drainage refer to the physical process of oxidation while the role of microorganisms is left unnoticed. When iron containing minerals such as pyrite is first exposed during the mining operations, a slow chemical reaction with molecular oxygen occurs.
