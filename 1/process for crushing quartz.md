## Micromachines | Free Full-Text | A Method of Restraining the Adverse 
The grinding method is used as the preliminary processing procedure for small aperture aspheric mirrors. Regular grinding marks produced in the grinding process significantly affect the mid-spatial frequency error; however, because of their small radius of surface curvatures and high steepness, they are difficult to polish using traditional methods. Therefore, in this study, the ultra
