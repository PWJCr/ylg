## Coal Remains Vital to South African Economy - Coal Age
Australian thermal coal exports to China amounted to some $4 billion during 2019, with another $10 billion in coking coal. According to export data, South Africa shipped 1.25 million metric tons (mt) of coal to China in February, up from zero in February 2020 and 330,000 mt in January. This has pushed China to the front of the queue as the

## How Is Coal Transported - Realonomics
How Is Coal Transported? Coal can be transported from mines and processing plants to consumers in several different ways: Conveyors trams and trucks move coal around mines short distances from mines to consumers close to the mines or to other modes of long-distance transportation. . Slurry pipelines move mixtures of crushed coal and water.

## Coal Mines in South Africa
According to Eskom, coal mines in South Africa produce 224 million tonnes per year. South Africa is the world's seventh largest coal producer after China, USA, India, Australia, Indonesia and Russia. 31% of all coal mines in South Africa can be found in the central Highveld while Witbank and Ermelo feature 30% and 13, 8% respectively.

## Coal - Minerals Council South Africa
Coal mining's advent in South Africa can best be traced to the start of gold mining in the late 19 th century, particularly on the Witwatersrand, with the first coal in appreciable tonnages being extracted on the Highveld coal field close to the nascent Witwatersrand gold mines. However, demand began to grow, slowly at first but then

## South Africa: Abandoned Coal Mines Risk Safety, Rights
Across the country, only 27 mines (all mining asbestos) of the 2,322 classified as "high-risk," including coal mines, have been cleaned up since 2009, South Africa's auditor general reported in 2021. Abandoned coal mines often leach highly acidic water that can pollute water sources, and unsecured mines pose an ongoing risk of accidents.

Coal Mining in South Africa - Universal Coal plc. Coal production in South Africa is concentrated in large mines, with 8 mines accounting for 61 % of the output. About 46.5 % of the country's coal mining is underground and 53.5 % is produced from open-cast mining methods (SA Yearbook 2007 / 08).

How many coal mines are in South Africa? South Africa's coal resources are contained in the Ecca deposits, a stratum of the Karoo Supergroup. There are 19 coalfields in the country and they are largely located in the north- eastern quarter of the country, i.e. Mpumalanga, Limpopo and extend to KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State.

## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.

Coal seams are relatively thick and close to the surface, which allows for low-cost mining; a quarter of South Africa's bituminous coal is between 15-50 m below the surface and much of the remainder between 50-200m. Half of reserves are in seams 4-6m thick and a further third in 2-4m seams (Petrick Commission, 1975).

While 93 coal mines produced all of South Africa's coal in 2016, that number increased 59%, to 148 mines, by 2016. Production, however, increased by only about 10%, indicative of a trend towards smaller mines. But with smaller mines and shorter lifespans, mining companies are targeting new areas for coal mining.
