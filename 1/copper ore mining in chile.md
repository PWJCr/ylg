## Mining in Chile | Cochilco
The degree of copper mineralization in Chile has no equal around the world. Indeed, Chile is home to some of the world's largest, better known copper mines. Approximately 80 percent of Chilean production comes from porphyry copper deposits rich in molybdenum, gold, and silver byproducts. Most such deposits lie in northern Chile (20º to 26º S).

## Copper: supply fundamentals trump weak sentiment
Copper is showing signs of stabilizing despite a current negative sentiment towards China-centric commodities. While the overall macro-economic sentiment remains weak, not only in China but also globally due to heightened recession fears, the copper market is showing emerging signs of fundamental strength as mining companies struggle to meet their production targets while demand, surprisingly
