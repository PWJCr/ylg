The odds are very low when milling bp but freak accidents can happen. This is why you should make sure your mill is up to the task and have a clean work area in a well placed area with plenty of distance. I usually add lump charcoal to my mill and let the mill do the reduction (vs a blender to reduce the charcoal).

If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.

## Ball mills
A ball mill uses the impact of metal or ceramic balls, falling from near the top of a horizontal shell to crush the material into fine particles. The outer cylindrical shell rotates to lift the grinding balls to the top from where they fall; grinding and blending the materials at the same time. Ball mills are typically used in the ceramic, glass, paint, pyrotechnics, and porcelain industries

Ball Mills. Ball mills have been the primary piece of machinery in traditional hard rock grinding circuits for 100+ years. They are proven workhorses, with discharge mesh sizes from ~40M to <200M. Use of a ball mill is the best choice when long term, stationary milling is justified by an operation. Sold individually or as part of our turn-key

## Making Black Powder with a Ball Mill - Skylighter, Inc.
We routinely recommend two ways: coffee milling and ball milling. Both ways have advantages. To grind a single chemical (vs. a mix like black powder) using a ball mill, fill your mill jar half full of hardened lead or brass grinding media, and 25% full of potassium nitrate. Turn the mill on and come back in an hour.

## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
