Just 48 miles northwest of Moab, White Wash Sand Dunes (also known as Tenmile Dunes) are among the most popular ATV trails around Moab. Over 100 miles of roads and trails with the gorgeous backdrop of the sand dunes. There are 1,400 miles of open riding area. Although the White Wash Sand dunes are not the largest in Utah, they are unique.

## comparison study of artificial sand and natural sand
The choice of fine aggregate, whether it is manufactured or natural sand, can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability, pumpability, and finishability. Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical.
