## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

## Iron Ore Jigging Separation Processing Plant
The choosing of iron separation equipment depends on specific ore natures and magnetite iron ore is usually concentrated by magnetic separation, but what about the beneficiation of hematite, limonite, specularite? The magnetic separation can not help to get ideal beneficiation efficiency. And here gravity separation, floatation separation and even roasting shall be considered.

## What is magnetic separation
Carrier magnetic separation has been proposed for more effective separation of water and solids from acid mine water to generate very pure water (Feng et al., 2000).As discussed in Chapter 10, dissolved heavy metals like zinc and copper can be recovered from acid mine drainage (AMD) by selective precipitation controlling the pH for the precipitation of specific metals.
