## What is the Crusher Dust?
Crusher dust, also known as blue metal, cracker, or rock dust, is simply the material leftover when making crushed rock. As rocks are run through the crusher, tiny pieces and dust particles are left behind. Instead of being thrown out as waste material, the dust is recycled and becomes a valuable product with many practical applications in both

At concrete crushing facilities, dust is generated at multiple points. Front end loaders, hoppers, and conveyor discharge points all bring dust when operational. Front end loaders transfer the incoming demolition materials to the hopper. Picking up these rocks creates dust as they are disturbed and dumped into the hopper.

When it comes to a healthy and robust lawn or any other plant, compaction is the enemy. When turf is grown in crusher dust, which means that it is growing in rock, it has shallow root growth causing the plant to always be thirsty and reliant on frequent watering. As we know, this has a disastrous result in times of drought and water restrictions.
