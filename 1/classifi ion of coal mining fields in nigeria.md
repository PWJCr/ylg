## Nigeria's coal deposits identified - How we made it in Africa
Coal deposits. The Anambra Basin, located in south-eastern Nigeria, appears to contain the largest and most economically viable coal resources. The basin covers an area of approximately 1.5 million hectares and is constrained by the Niger River on the west, the Benue River on the north and the Enugu Escarpment on the east.

## Nigerian Coal Corporation
In 1909, coal was discovered in Enugu, Nigeria. The Ogbete drift mine opened six years later. The Ogbete mine's operations and others in the country were merged into a new corporation in 1950: The Nigerian Coal Corporation. The NCC was tasked with exploiting coal resources, [2] and held a monopoly on coal and coke mining, production, and sales

## Coal Production and Utilization Trends in Nigeria
Production of coal in Nigeria started soon after its discovery. There are two production eras- the pre-civil war and the post-war. Production rate increased gradually until 1958 when it was dramatically increased to meet the demand of the new coal-fired power plants. The post-civil war production started with less than 10,000 tonnes per year

An in-depth analysis on mining in Nigeria. By Guest Contributor. Oct 27, 2020. The economy in Nigeria has been growing slowly since the oil price slump of 2014. Since then, volatility of global oil prices has negatively impacted growth performance. Between 2000 and 2014, GDP grew at an average of 7% annually.

## Types of Jobs in Coal Mining | Work
There are different types of jobs in the coal industry. It's commonly thought that one of the few jobs in the coal industry is that of a miner who helps remove the coal once deposits are found, but there are other high-paying jobs, as well. Geologist: The mining industry needs mine geologists and exploration geologists.

Abiodun Baiyewu-Teru looks at the history of coal in Nigeria. Coal was first discovered in Nigeria in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu by a British mines engineer, Albert Kitson. Kitson had been prospecting for silver. By 1914, the year of Nigeria's amalgamation, the first consignment of coal made its way to the United Kingdom from the newly

## Coal
What is Nigeria's coal policy? The National Energy Master Plan (NEMP) of 2014 foresaw a major role for coal. It calculated the role of coal, and its potential contribution to Nigeria's total electricity supply under different national economic growth scenarios, such as 7%, 10%, 11.5% and 13% annual GDP growth rates.

Mining in Nigeria. As you see, Nigeria is rich in various minerals. Ancient crystalline rocks contain nonferrous and rare metal ores: tin, niobium, molybdenum, zirconium, tantalum, uranium, gold and silver. In sedimentary rocks, there are deposits of coal, oil, gas, limestone etc. Main wealth of the country - is oil.

## coal mining - Coal deposits | Britannica
In geologic terms, coal is a sedimentary rock containing a mixture of constituents, mostly of vegetal origin. Vegetal matter is composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and some inorganic mineral elements. When this material decays under water, in the absence of oxygen, the carbon content increases. The initial product of this decomposition process is known as peat.

## USGS Bulletin 1823 - Sampling of Coal Beds for Analysis
A common practice of sampling thick coal beds (greater than 10 m thick), either by core or by channel, is to divide the bed into intervals no thicker than 1.5 m. In many cases, thick coals are sampled in 0.7 m sections; such sampling provides a detailed stratigraphic section of the bed. Core samples are best for thick-bed sampling.
