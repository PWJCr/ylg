## Grinding Machine - Types and Uses of a Grinding Machine
Types and Uses of a Grinding Machine. Posted on October 19, 2012 by Yash Shah. The grinding machine is a type of tool that is utilized for grinding work pieces. It basically use an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. The rough surface of the abrasive wheel shreds off small portions of the work piece as required. It is also known as a grinder.
