## Differences and Applications of Magnetic Separation and Froth Flotation 
The principle behind froth flotation process is that sulphide ores are preferentially wetted by pine oil whereas gangue articles are wetted by water. In this process, the suspension of a powdered ore is made with water. Collectors like pine oil, fatty acids and xanthate are added to it. Froth stabilizers like wrestles and any line stabilized

Answer (1 of 2): Let's think about this: Both are in the end gravity processes. I will do them backwards, though. Gravity separation depends upon the difference in density / specific gravity of a solid and a fluid (liquid or gas). Particles more dense that the fluid will tend to fall, unless the

Beneficiation (e.g., froth flotation, magnetic separation, gravity separation) of REE minerals have become increasingly complicated, especially where ore grade is significantly low [<1% total REO (TREO)]. Typically, low-grade ores are dominated by fine- to ultrafine gangue minerals, including silicates, carbonates, and phosphates.

##  Separation and Purification Technology
ration or dense medium separation often requires relatively large par- ticle size and a high degree of liberation, film flotation is only suitable for ultrafine particles (e.g., less than 10 µm

##  Extraction of Phosphorous from a Phosphorous-Containing Vanadium Titano 
The direction ﬂotation process was used to recover phosphorous from the low-grade phosphorous-bearing V-Ti magnetite tailings. The results showed that an optimized phosphorous concentrate with a P2O5 grade of 31.35% and P2O5 recovery of 88.02% was obtained by ﬂotation process of one roughing, three scavengings, and three cleanings under
