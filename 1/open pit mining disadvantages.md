Open-pit mining is much safer than shaft mining. In underground mining, the threat of a cave-in or release of toxic gas is a constant concern. When shaft mining was the most common method of ore extraction, thousands died in cave-ins, gas events and accidents involving equipment. In 1907 alone, more than 3,200 deaths related to mining occurred.

The major disadvantages of UG Mining are Dangerous in nature for the miners. Persons who work in UG mines will be under Continuous danger from Strata ( from collapse from side and roof), poisonous and toxic gases. There will be danger of explosion, fire and also inundation (flooding). As the working area is limited, high mechanisation is limited.

## Open-pit Mining - Mining North Works
The main cost advantage of open-pit mining is that it allows mining with more efficient larger equipment. This means faster production and mining of lower grades of ore is possible. It also means potentially bigger revenues early as the mine prepares to go underground and mine the deeper parts of the orebody.

As can be seen, no one chooses to exploit an open or underground pit, but the conditions of nature that concentrate the metals in one way or another. A "Disseminated" deposit, such as a Copper porphyry, can not be exploited underground, just as a Lead vein (galena) can not be exploited in the open.
