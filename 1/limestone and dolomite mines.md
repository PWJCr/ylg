## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium

## Limestone in Virginia
Virginia has different types of rocks rich in calcium carbonate, including limestone, dolomite, marl, and travertine.  The decline in underground coal mining, as natural gas became less expensive after fracking increased supply, led to a layoff at the Carmeuse Lime and Stone quarry outside of Strasburg. The quarry was located far from the

## Limestone and dolomite - Earth Resources
Jun 2, 2021Limestone and dolomite, Limestone rock, Limestone and dolomite have been formed in a variety of settings in Victoria and range in age from early Palaeozoic to Quaternary. Younger limestones tend to be friable and porous, whereas older limestones are often dolomitised and silicified, or metamorphosed and recrystallised to marble.

In central Kentucky, Ordovician limestone and dolomite are mined and quarried for construction aggregate. Stone is being produced from the High Bridge Group and the overlying Lexington Limestone. The High Bridge Group consists of three formations: in descending stratigraphic order, the Tyrone Limestone, Oregon Formation, and Camp Nelson Limestone.
