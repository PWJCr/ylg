Prospectors established in 1886 the existence of a belt of gold-bearing reefs 40 miles (60 km) wide centred on present-day Johannesburg. The rapid growth of the gold-mining industry intensified processes started by the diamond boom: immigration, urbanization, capital investment, and labour migrancy. By 1899 the gold industry attracted investment worth £75 million, produced almost three-tenths

In 2013, mining companies produced 562,000 times as much waste as gold, according to the South African Chamber of Mines. A decade before, that same ratio was less than half as large, at 212,000 to 1. Mining operations are generating increased waste because South Africa's gold is running out, and the remaining resource can only be found

Today it is estimated that almost 75% of gold mines are unprofitable. The result is large layoffs in the mining industry. At least 70,000 people have lost jobs in the last five years, which is almost 40% of South African's industry. Currently, 95,130 people work in gold mining, but this number is falling every year.

This is shocking, but still emphasises the potential of gold mining as an employer where, despite a collapse in output, still employs 30% of the 1994 numbers. The main explanation for the collapse of gold mining in South Africa is margin squeeze as a result of cost increases at depth.

One way that you can physically buy this commodity is if you invest your money in Kruger Rands but this can be risky and not to mention it will more than likely be more costly than buying shares.
