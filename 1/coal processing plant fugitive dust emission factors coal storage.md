## Improved Emission Factors for Fugitive Dust From Western Surface Coal 
The primary purpose of this study was to develop emission factors for significant surface coal mining operations that are applicable at Western surface coal mines and are based on state-of-the-art sampling and data analysis procedures. Primary objectives were (1) to develop emission factors for individual mining operations, in the form of equations with several correction factors to account

## Fugitive Emission - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Fugitive emission is defined as the unintentional and undesirable emission, leakage or discharge of gases or vapors from pressure-containing equipment or facilities and components inside plants such as valves, piping flanges, pumps, storage tanks, valves, compressors, etc. Fugitive emission is also known as leak or leakage. The term 'fugitive' is used because these emissions are not taken

Model outputs coupled with ambient measurements yielded fugitive fly ash EFs that averaged 96 g Mg (-1) (of ash processed) for the PM (c) fraction (= PM10 - PM2.5) and 18 g Mg (-1) for PM2.5. Median EFs were much lower due to the strongly skewed shape of the derived EF distributions. Fugitive EFs from nearby unpaved roads were also characterized.
