Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum. The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process. In the Bayer Process, the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite. The aluminum is precipitated out of solution in the form of aluminum hydroxide

Bauxite is collected from the ground in an open-pit mining operation. It doesn't sit very deeply in the earth's crust, so some energy can be saved on drilling. However, to recover all the aluminum in an area, swaths of land must be bull-dozed to reveal the dirt and ore underneath. Once collected, the bauxite ore has to be refined

## How Aluminum Is Made | Metal Supermarkets
Mining Aluminum. Geologists locate bauxite deposits by taking samples and conducting investigatory drilling. When deposits are found, they are mined in open pits. The earth is blasted loose and the bauxite is extracted using power shovels or draglines. 90% of all mined bauxite is made into alumina to be smelted into aluminum.
