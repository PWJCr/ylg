In the state of Meghalaya in India lies the world's longest single-belt international conveyor. It is about 17 km long and conveys limestone and shale at 960 tons/hour, from a quarry in India to a cement factory at Chhatak Bangladesh. The belt is 7 km long in India and 10 km long in Bangladesh. The entire conveyor has been put on trestles.

## Conveyor Belt Maintenance & Common Conveyor Problems | SEMCOR

Doing so would be a good way to get a finger crushed or broken if your fingers happen to get caught in the machinery. Even more dangerous is the electrical current powering the conveyor belt.

## How Long Does Electrical Wiring Last in a Home?
Romex electrical wire sheathing can last 80 years or longer. The plastic sheathing doesn't degrade as fast as cloth sheathed wiring.

For example: Copper wires can last over 100 years.
