Water is the catalyst that hydrates the cement and makes the mixture workable. For complete cement hydration, you need a water-to-cement ratio of 0.19 to 0.22. However, to make the concrete workable, the w/c ratio ranges from 0.40 to 0.60. Slump determines concrete consistency, as it relates to its fluidity or mobility.
