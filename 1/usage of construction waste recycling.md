## Construction and demolition waste management in Korea: recycled 
In 2003, the Construction Waste Recycling Promotion Act was enacted for the purpose of efficient use of national resources by promoting the recycling of C&D waste. In 2005, the year the Act was enforced, the C&D waste amounted to 2.7 million tons, exceeding 50% of the total landfill waste of 4.8 million tons that year, but gradually decreased

On average, nearly 15 percent of the materials used in production processes across the sectors are recycled materials. In the use of recycled materials, not only the amount of materials used is important, but also their quality.

As concrete is one of the most used construction materials with a demand of 30 billion tons per year, concrete recycling could massively reduce this waste stream. Also recycling construction materials cuts down the distance that materials need to be transported and reduces the amount of raw primary material extracted from the land.
