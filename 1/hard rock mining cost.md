## Overburden Removal Cost and How Containment Affects It - BTL Liners
Costs of Removal, Storage, and Containment. It is not just the raw ratio of overburden material to desirable ore that determines if a mining operation is worthwhile or not. The removal method needed to get the overburden out of the way also factors into the equation. For example, hard rock removal with blasting is far more costly than

## Assignment 1-Selection of suitable underground hard rock mining method 
1. Introduction The multitude of underground mining methods that are being used to extract hard minerals like ores of gold, zinc, copper, and hard rocks like diamonds are included in underground hard rock mining. The rocks are mainly accessed with the use of a decline or vertical shaft (Palanikkumar et al., 2022). One of the most crucial aspects of underground hard-rock mining is ventilation

## Trends in underground hard-rock mining for gold and base metals
Jul 20, 2021. DOWNLOAD MINING ELITES IN AFRICA 2021. While underground mining methods show higher cost than open pit, their complexity almost always means that there is opportunity in both productivity and cost improvement. Underground hard-rock mining accounts for 40% of global mining operations but only 12% of run-of-mine (ROM) production.
