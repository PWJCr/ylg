The first way is for setting adjustment to be done by rotating the bowl against the threads so that the vertical position of the outer wear part, concave, is changed. One advantage of this adjustment type is that liners wear more evenly. Another principle is that of setting the adjustment by lifting or lowering the main shaft.
