Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e. gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as color) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calverite (AuTe), aurostibnite (AuSb

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## How Is Gold Formed? Origins and Process - ThoughtCo
Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.

## Gold Processing Methods & Gold Ore Extraction
Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.
