## Vertical vs. Horizontal Milling Machines - Fusion 360 Blog
Vertical Milling Machines In vertical mills, the spindle axis is vertically oriented. Milling cutters are held in the spindle and rotate on its axis. Typically the spindle can be extended or the table raised or lowered to produce the same effect, allowing for plunge cuts and drilling. The two kinds of vertical mills are bed mills and turret mills.

## What is Milling Machine?- Parts, Operation, Diagram
The end milling is the operation of producing a flat surface that may be vertical, horizontal, or at an angle in reference to the table surface. The cutter used is an end mill. The end milling cutters are also used for the production of slots, grooves, or keyways. A vertical milling machine is more suitable for end milling operation. 10. Saw

## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling. Milling Processes
Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed, the overall removal is quite brisk.
