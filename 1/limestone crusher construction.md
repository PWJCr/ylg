## Limestone vs Granite: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
The hardness of limestone averagely ranges from three to four while that of granite from six to seven. The heat capacity of limestone is 0.91 KJ/Kg K, whereas that of graphite is 0.79 KJ/Kg K. Therefore, with such properties and other compounds in each stone, limestone is more inclined to be pressure-resistant while granite is heat resistant.
