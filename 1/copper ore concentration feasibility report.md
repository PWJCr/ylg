Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to

This depends on the grade of the ores: gold grades are around 1 g gold/tonne of ore, copper ore contain around 1% metal, while iron ore with a grade of around 60%. The production of ores containing PGMs is however much smaller, only 100 Mt. Most ores are produced in open pit operations, as much as 85% varying from metal to metal.

All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market..

## Minerals | Special Issue : Recent Advances in Copper Ore  - MDPI
In this investigation, a laboratory-scale study to extract copper (Cu) from its oxide ore (0.425-11.2 mm particle size) was conducted using varied sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) concentrations (0.05-0.5 M) as a lixiviant. Through a physicochemical and mineralogical analysis of real field ore samples from the Almalyk mine heap site (Tashkent
