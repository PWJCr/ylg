## Chuquicamata Copper Mine, Northern region of Chile
Mining and ore processing at Chuquicamata copper mine. The Chuquicamata copper mine currently employs conventional open-pit mining method, with the help of trucks and shovels. The underground mine proposes to use block caving method of mining, through a 1,000m-deep shaft. Ore will be extracted by macro blocks and block caving in four production levels.

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores. El Teniente, in Chile, is the world's largest
