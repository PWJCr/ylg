## Crusher
Primary crushing reduces the large pieces to a size which can be handled by the downstream machinery.  When used with jaw crusher, it can be used as secondary, tertiary or quaternary crushing. Generally speaking, the standard type of Symons cone crusher is applied to medium crushing. The medium type is applied to fine crushing. The short

## What Do Primary, Secondary, and Post-Secondary Education Mean?
Post-secondary education—also known as tertiary education—follows secondary education. Post-secondary education generally includes education at colleges, universities, or trade schools and typically occurs after the age of 18, though students in some countries may start a little younger.
