Answer (1 of 4): I'm not an authority on this subject, but here are some thoughts. That depends upon what the quarry dust is. If it has minerals that will react with the cement you could get a faster or slower set time. Also, since quarry dust is quite fine, you should have a denser concrete. Hig

## replacement of sand by quarry dust
Quarry dust can be used as an economic alternative to the natural sand. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize quarry dust as a partial substitute for natural sand in producing concrete. Natural sand is replaced by Quarry dust at an interval of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. Mix proportions for M 20.

## properties of quarry dust compared to fine aggregates
Balamurugan et.al.(2013)(8) ascertained that quarry dust can be utilized in concrete mixtures as a good substitute for river sand with higher strength at 50% replacement. Adams et.al.(2013)(9) found that the replacement of 50% fine aggregate by M-Sand induced higher compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and durability.

## Effect of Partial Replacement of Sand With Quarry Dust on The 
This work investigated the effect of partial replacement of sand with quarry dust on the compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength and water absorption of sandcrete blocks. River sand was replaced with quarry dust at percentages ranging from 0 to 40 at cement/combined aggregate ratio of 1: 6. The blocks were moulded using a Rosa Commetta block laying machine and were

## Stress-strain characteristics of concrete containing quarry rock dust 
However, the 25% sand replacement level modulus of elasticity values are higher than those of the ACI, BS and IS formulas. For quarry dust concrete, the following formulas are proposed from the study: (4) Optimum Blend 25: 75 (QD: Sand): E c = 4576 (f cu) 0.53 (5) 100 % Quarry dust: E c = 3983 (f cu) 0.53. 4.
