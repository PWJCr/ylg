## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
