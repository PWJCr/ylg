## Extraction of Aluminium (Aluminium Ore) - Hall-Heroults Process & Uses 
Bauxite is the name given to aluminium ore. To generate aluminium oxide, bauxite is purified, a white powder from which aluminium can be extracted. Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point of more than 2000° C which makes melting very expensive. Aluminium oxide in water does not dissolve, but in molten cryolite, it dissolves.

Aluminium is extracted by electrolysis. The aluminium oxide is dissolve in molten cryolite and then reduced to the pure metal. The first stage is the removal of the impurities, sand and some iron oxide. The pure aluminium oxide left is called alumina. Electricity is passed tgrough the alumina solution via electrodes.

Bauxite is collected from the ground in an open-pit mining operation. It doesn't sit very deeply in the earth's crust, so some energy can be saved on drilling. However, to recover all the aluminum in an area, swaths of land must be bull-dozed to reveal the dirt and ore underneath. Once collected, the bauxite ore has to be refined

## What is the significance of leaching in the extraction of aluminium?
Which substance is used to leach the ore in aluminium extraction? In the Bayer process, bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at a temperature of 150 to 200 °C. At these temperatures, the aluminium is dissolved as sodium aluminate (primarily [Al(OH) 4] −) in an extraction process.

At an aluminium smelter, alumina is poured into special reduction cells with molten cryolite at 950℃. Electric currents are then induced in the mixture at 400 kA or above; this current breaks the bond between the aluminium and oxygen atoms resulting in liquid aluminium settling at the bottom of the reduction cell.

Firstly, aluminium has to be removed from the Earth, by mining. This is relatively simple, given the abundance of Aluminium. However, Aluminium is always bounded to other elements, and exists as compounds, often containing oxygen and silicon. Thus, it is impossible to obtain a pure substance of aluminium through mining. Aluminium's ore is bauxite.

## EXTRACTION ET PRODUCTION DE L'ALUMINIUM - Google
La bauxite, minerai dans lequel l'aluminium est présent sous la forme d'oxyde hydraté, a été découverte en France puis dans d'autres pays du monde. Les gisements exploités de bauxite se situent aujourd'hui sur tous les continents, en particulier en Afrique, Australie et Amérique latine. Ils se trouvent généralement dans des

## Bauxite Mining's Negative Effects on Human and Environment
We can get aluminum from bauxite beneficiation process, and the elements of residues in the process are iron oxide (10 - 30%), titanium dioxide (2 - 15%), silicon oxide (5 - 20%), and insoluble oxidation aluminum (0-20%).. These elements are difficult to completely eradicate from the residue, so it has caused a series of ecological problems.

## factors affecting the siting of an aluminium extraction plant
In: bauxite (from overseas) so being near a seaport is useful, especially if the bauxite can be transferred directly from ship to factory without being loaded onto trucks / train. Out: aluminium (some products can be manufactured on site but most is shipped out as ingots) so access to a seaport is good but rail / road access is good because the
