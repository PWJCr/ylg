## Iron ore: Mineral information, data and localities.
As a Commodity:Iron. Ferruginous rock containing one or more minerals from which metallic iron may be profitably extracted. The chief ores of iron consist mainly of the oxides: hematite, Fe2O3 ; goethite, alpha -FeO (OH); magnetite, Fe3O4; and the carbonate, siderite FeCO3. See Also: bog iron ore, Limonite, kidney iron ore, Magnetite, Siderite

DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.

The angle of dip varies from 15° to 20°, and up to 85° and even 90°, with the horizon. The ore is rather soft, bluish-black in color, and is a hematite. It varies in thickness from a few inches to one hundred feet, or more. It is mainly "Bessemer" ore, containing 57 to 63 per cent, of metallic iron, and .03 to .07 per cent, of phosphorus.
