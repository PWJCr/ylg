## Primary Crushing - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The term "primary crusher," by definition, might embrace any type and size of crushing machine. The term implies that at least two stages of crushing are involved, but in many cases the machine which performs the function of initial crusher is the only crusher in the plant.

## All crusher types for your reduction needs - Metso Outotec
The main purpose of a primary crusher is to reduce the material to a size that allows its transportation on a conveyor belt. In most crushing installations a jaw crusher takes care of primary crushing. Plants with very high capacities that are common in mining and less popular in aggregates production, normally use a primary gyratory crusher.
