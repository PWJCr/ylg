## Sulfur
Physical properties. Sulfur forms several polyatomic molecules. The best-known allotrope is octasulfur, cyclo-S 8.The point group of cyclo-S 8 is D 4d and its dipole moment is 0 D. Octasulfur is a soft, bright-yellow solid that is odorless, but impure samples have an odor similar to that of matches. It melts at 115.21 °C (239.38 °F), boils at 444.6 °C (832.3 °F) and sublimates easily.

If sulfide ore or sulfide tailings are exposed to water and air during mining, a chemical reaction creates sulfuric acid - basically battery acid. There has never been a sulfide mine that has not polluted nearby water resources. Pollution from sulfide mining is very expensive to fix, and a burden for taxpayers.

An ironworks (or iron works) is an industrial plant for the production of steel from iron ores! Before the iron ores can be fed to the ironworks, they must first be mined (ore extraction) and specially processed for the blast furnace process (ore processing). These process steps are described in more detail in the following sections.
