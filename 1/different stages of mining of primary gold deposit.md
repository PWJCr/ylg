## Mining engineering
Mining in the engineering discipline is the extraction of minerals from underneath, open pit, above or on the ground. Mining engineering is associated with many other disciplines, such as mineral processing, exploration, excavation, geology, and metallurgy, geotechnical engineering and surveying.A mining engineer may manage any phase of mining operations, from exploration and discovery of the

Surface mining is done in five ways: Strip mining - Strip mining is the most common surface mining method used to mine coal and lignite. The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral. Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface.

1. Rock gold is the most common form of pure gold. Gold is hidden in the quartz veins in the rock, we need to find the gold-bearing rocks first, then exploit the ore, crush them into ore powder, and then purify them by gravity or flotation. 2. The placer gold is easy to mine. The process of rock gold mining is relatively complicated and difficult.
