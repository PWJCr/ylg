## Iron Ore Industry - Beneficiation Technology
Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

## Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional 
Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional beneficiation plants The hematite ore (Fe 2 O 3) is always associated with limonite & goethite ores, which cannot be attracted by high gauss magnetic separators in the conventional beneficiation plants. Such tailings have 30-50% left-over Fe, which is a waste of natural resources.

The ore after crushing to -3" size was attrition ground and washed in a concrete mixer. But there was not much improvement in the grade of the coarse fraction, because of the small clay content in the ore.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.
