## 3 examples of magnetic separationkiny.pl
Co-precipitation is a facile and convenient way to synthesize iron oxides (either Fe 3 O 4 or γ-Fe 2 O 3 ) from aqueous Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ salt solutions by the addition of a base under inert atmosphere at room temperature or at elevated temperature. The size, shape, and composition of the magnetic nanoparticles very much depends on the type of salts used (e.g.chlorides, sulfates, nitrates), the Fe.

## What is A Ferrous Metal? - A Complete Guide - Engineering Choice
Ferrous metals are those that contain only small amounts of iron in their composition. Ferrous metals are magnetic and have high strength and hardness due to their iron content. Ferrous metal is any metal that is primarily composed of iron and has magnetic properties. Ferrous metal is known for its hardness, durability, and tensile strength.

Engineers wanted to furtheroptimize the separation of non-ferrous metals out ofthe fine-grain fraction and, at the same time, simplifythe machine's operation and maintenance.STEINERT adapted the outputto the machine's requirementsand developed a splitter that canhandle the three different typesof fine-grain material.
