## Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences
In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap. This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.

CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl, but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary, tertiary and quaternary stages.

## crusher mantel | circle valve
A gyratory crusher uses a mantle that gyrates (rotates) within a cone shaped inner surface lined with wear resisting plates often called concaves. As the mantle gyrates within the crushing chamber, progressively approaching, and receding from, each element of the cone shaped inner surface, it creates compressive force, which fractures the

## Chamber Optimization for Comprehensive Improvement of Cone Crusher 
Finally, based on the iron ore coarsely crushed by the gyratory crusher, the dynamic characteristics of the C900 cone crusher were simulated by using the discrete element method (DEM), and the simulation results are basically consistent with the numerical analysis results. Results show that considering the amount of ore uplift in the blockage

## Difference between Cone & Gyratory Crusher
A gyratory crusher has a higher angle at the cone apex. This provides a longer residence time along the crushing interface and is supposed to generate a smaller & more consistent product. Metso Minerals have much more, probably much better, information on their website. 28th January 2009, 0:44 #3.

## Gyratory Crushers - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Gyratory Crushers. The primary rock breaker most commonly used in large plants is the gyratory crusher, of which a typical section is shown in Fig. 5. It consists essentially of a gyrating crushing head (521) working inside a crushing bowl (522) which is fixed to the frame (501). The crushing head is carried on a short solid main shaft (515

The gyratory crushers are equipped with a hydraulic setting adjustment system, which makes it possible to regulate the gradation of the crushed material. Cone crushers . Cone crushers resemble gyratory crushers from technological standpoint, but unlike gyratory crushers, cone crushers are popular in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary crushing
