## Manufacture of Pitch-based carbon fibers--CFCCARBON LTD
Mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers are an attractive precursor candidate for carbon fibers because of the high availability of low-cost raw pitch. There are several reasons why the mesophase pitch process should produce a lower cost, high-performance fiber. First, the starting material (petroleum or coat-tar pitch) costs 40-50 percent less than the monomers used to form PAN. Second, because

Blend pitch/LLDPE carbon fibres showed reduced brittleness combined with excellent thermal stability, and thus are a candidate as a potential precursor for pitch-based carbon fibre manufacturing. The advantage of mesophase pitch-based carbon fibres is their high modulus, but pitch-based carbon fibres and precursors are very brittle.

## How Carbon Capture Works
There are essentially two types of carbon dioxide capture in use today: Post-combustion processes, which separate CO2 from other exhaust gases and capture it using a variety of technologies, producing pure, storable carbon dioxide. Pre-combustion processes, which convert fuel into a gaseous mixture of mostly hydrogen and CO2.

Many of these complex parts require geometries that are well-suited to production with additive manufacturing, which can be done more efficiently and cost-effectively than using traditional fabrication methods.

## Introduction of manufacturing of carbon fibers-Pan-based carbon fibers
At present, all commercial carbon fibers are produced by the thermal decomposition of various organic fiber precursors. The most popular precursor materials are fibers of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), cellulos (Rayon), and pitch. A proposed alternate process, which produces a discontinuous, high-performance carbon fiber, is called vapor-growth.

## Carbon Manufacturing From Pitch
Manufacturing Pitch and Polyethylene BlendsBased. The advantage of mesophase pitch-based carbon fibres is their high modulus but pitch-based carbon fibres and precursors are very brittle. This paper reports the development of a unique manufacturing method using a blend of pitch and linear low-density polyethylene LLDPE from which it is possible
