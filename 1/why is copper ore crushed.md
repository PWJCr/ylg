## Turning Copper Ore into Copper: What are the Processes?
After the ore is crushed to powder, it is treated with froth flotation, whereby the powder reacts with reagents that treat the copper to make it hydrophobic. After being treated further with water and a foaming agent, frothing is enhanced. After the air is brought up through the water, bubbles form that float the water-repellent copper

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.
