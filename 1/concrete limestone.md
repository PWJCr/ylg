10,000 BCE to 8,200 BCE The earliest known use of limestone in a structure was found in the Göbekli Tepe temple in modern-day Turkey, from about 10,000 BCE—7,000 years before the Great Pyramid of Giza. Göbekli Tepe is the oldest known example of monumental architecture—the first structure human beings put together that was bigger and more complicated than a hut.

## Portland Limestone Cement Makes Concrete Greener
It generates more than 525 kg of CO2 per ton of clinker. Therefore, using less clinker is key to more sustainable concrete. Type IL cements do just that. Portland cement is about 91 percent clinker, while PLC is just 83 percent clinker. Limestone content is up to five percent in ordinary Portland cement (OPC), but as high as 15 percent in PLC.

A limestone overlay contains real limestone, not just mimicking the look like with other types of concrete coatings. Instead, the coating used is a special blend made of crushed quartz and various grades of limestone.

## How is concrete made from limestone? | Shelly Company
To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

Concrete also resists the growth of many mosses and lichens (a fungus that grows symbiotically with algae) better than limestone. Limestone is calcium carbonate, a source of nutrients for lichens. Our concrete matrix (cement) is calcium silicate and fine aggregates of quartz (silica) sand which provide no nutrients.
