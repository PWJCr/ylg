## Solved 6. To extract gold from its ore, the ore is treated - Chegg
To extract gold from its ore, the ore is treated with sodium cyanide solution in the presence of oxygen and water: 4Au + 8NaCN + O2 + 2H20-4NaAu(CN)2 + 4NaOH Determine the mass of gold that can be extracted if 25.0 g of sodium cyanide is used. 7. One method for producing nitrogen in the laboratory is to react ammonia with copper (ll) oxide.

## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.The great majority of gold is extracted from dilute ores using a combination of chemical processes. About 2000 tons are obtained from the earth annually, plus another 300 tons from recycling.

With ores of higher gold content (i.e., greater than 20 grams of gold per ton of ore), cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching, which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent for several hours in large tanks equipped with agitators. For extracting gold from low-grade ores, heap leaching is practiced.

Several processes can then be used to separate the gold from the ore. The most common techniques in the United States use cyanide in various ways. In one, the ground ore is put into a tank containing a weak cyanide solution and zinc is added. The zinc causes a chemical reaction which separates the gold from the ore.

In one, the ground ore is put into a tank containing a weak cyanide solution and zinc is added. The zinc causes a chemical reaction which separates the gold from the ore. The gold is then removed from the solution with a filter press. For the carbon-in-pulp method, the ground ore is mixed with water before cyanide is added.

By mixing mercury with crushed ore, even the finest particles of gold could be collected. After heat-treating the resulting slurry, miners could separate the mercury and gold for processing. Gold cyanidation dates back to 1783 when Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that gold could be dissolved in an aqueous cyanide solution.

## How To Extract Gold From Rock - Forex-Gold
May 10, 2021Generally, differing kinds of gold ores are extracted in an exceedingly general open and underground manner. Extracting ore from open mines is way easier and might be through with lower investment and operating costs. About 65 percent of the gold ore within the u. s. is currently extracted in open mines and 35 percent in underground mines.
