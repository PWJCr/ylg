## How to Make a Grain Mill • Homemade Crafts
A grain mill's body must be sturdy enough to support the weight of the grain hopper and rollers, as well as withstand the friction of the grinding process. Wood is a popular choice for grain mill bodies, but other materials are also appropriate. Besides wood, the most important part of a grain mill is the roller, which may be made from metal

## Crushin' It - Homebrew Grain Mill Gap Settings | MoreBeer
Using a standard 2-roller homebrew mill, I crushed each malt using four different gap settings. The gap settings were 1.25 mm, 1.0 mm, 0.75 mm and 0.50 mm, and I used a feeler gauge to confirm these gap setting between each milling. After milling, I performed a grain sieve test on the different malts and crushes, and recorded all of the results.

## Important Dos and Don'ts for your New Roller Mill - automatic-ag-2
Do not attempt full RPMs while you are first attaching the tractor to your roller mill. Do not pass 1000 RPMs while operating your PTO roller mill. Make sure you start the mill each time while clean. If there is grain between the rolls when you attempt to power on and use your machine, you may experience errors - such as shearing bolt in PTO.
