## Silica vs. Silica: What's the Difference as Far as Concrete and Health 
Crystalline silica (quartz) is the form of silica that OSHA is writing the new regulations to cover, it is a health hazard. It is not reactive with portland cement, meaning it does not cause ASR (alkali-silica reactivity) regardless of particle size. Lots of countertop makers use 30 to 40 mesh crystalline silica sand in their GFRC mixes.

Composition & Types of Sand. Sand is a mixture of small grains of rock and granular materials which is mainly defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt. And ranging in size from 0.06 mm to 2 mm. Particles which are larger than 0. mm but smaller than 0.0625 mm are termed silt. Sand is made by erosion or broken pebbles

So, yes, play sand is made of crystalline silica. This is another name for quartz. However, inhaling crystalline silica is not a significant health concern. People believe it is because of the OSHA ban on using crystalline silica for sandblasting. This is in place because when you vigorously pulverise the grains, they become dangerous.

Pool filter sand is exclusively made from silica, a material that is derived from quartz. Silica is one of the more effective materials when it comes to being able to "grab" debris and impurities, which is why it is a must for pool sand. Play sand, on the other hand, is usually made primarily of silica. However, it doesn't always have to be silica.
