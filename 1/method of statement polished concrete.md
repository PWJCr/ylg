## Polished concrete
Polished concrete is a multi-step process where a concrete floor is mechanically ground, honed and polished with bonded abrasives in order to cut a concrete floor's surface. It is then refined with each cut in order to achieve a specified level of appearance. This process also includes the use of a penetrant chemical known as a hardener.

Polishing Process The process begins with the use of coarse diamond segments bonded in a metallic matrix. These segments are coarse enough to remove minor pits, blemishes, stains, or light coatings from the floor in preparation for final smoothing. Depending on the condition of the concrete, this initial rough grinding is generally a three- to four-step process.

## Concrete Polishing: Basic Steps to Polishing Concrete Floors
Choosing a Polishing Method: Wet vs. Dry You can polish concrete using wet or dry methods. Although each has its advantages, many polishing contractors prefer the dry method because it's faster, more convenient, and environmentally friendly. Wet polishing uses water to cool the diamond abrasives and eliminate grinding dust.
