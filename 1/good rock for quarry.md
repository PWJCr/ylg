## 3. The Environmental Impacts of Aggregate Extraction | Toronto 
Aggregate is mined from the earth, either dug out of pits or blasted out of quarries. This process has many significant environmental impacts.

Rock Quarry Beach is a popular local surfing beach located on Kauai's north shore within a somewhat protected bay. The Kilauea stream empties into this bay. A large sandbar formed by the mouth of the Kilauea River creates a calm area, however, the bay itself is not protected by any offshore reef so it is subject to large surf.

## Where to Find Rocks: The Best Places to Collect and Why

Older, more weathered rocks just don't make for good specimens in a collection.

## What Exactly Goes on in a Rock Quarry? - Coyle Stone
You need to realize that no two rock quarries are the same. They operate pretty much the same, but depending on where they are located and what kind of stone is being quarried, can make them operate just a little different. A rock quarry is mining for big rocks that are eventually made into smaller rocks or sand. Then they are sold to builders or contractors where they are made into bridges, highways and roadways, houses, and shopping malls.
