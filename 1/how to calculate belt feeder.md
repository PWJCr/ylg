## Apron Feeder Calculations
In this calculation you can consider, material cross section height about 75% of material cross section width. 4) Use the width as per calculation of serial number 3 or to suit the lump size whichever is more. 5) Adjust the speed to suit the final selected material cross section width and height. 6) Apron feeders always need variable speed drive.
