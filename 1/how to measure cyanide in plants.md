## How do plants produce cyanide?ntal
The very earliest farmers, selecting plants to bring into cultivation, might have found these "clean" plants particularly attractive. Likewise, how is cyanide made? In industry, people make cyanide by using ammonia (NH3) and carbon monoxide (CO) at high temperature (500 degree C) with Thorium dioxide (ThO2) as catalyst. The product HCN in

## Cyanide Poisoning and Cassava - CFS
Prepare cyanogenic plants such as cassava and bamboo shoot properly before consumption. Cyanogenic plants should be cut into smaller pieces, soaked in water and cooked thoroughly in boiling water. Maintain a balanced diet to avoid excessive exposure to harmful chemicals from a small range of food items.

Hydrogen cyanide (as mentioned), glucose and benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde, which tastes strongly of almonds, amaretto or marzipan is a common chemical in many young plants. Rowan buds for example, have a very intense marzipan flavour. Blackthorn (sloe) leaves are used to make a drink called épine which tastes like an amaretto-flavoured port.

By needing to analyze multiple points (i.e., the plant, the tailing facilities, detox plant), they could diagnose various issues quickly. As a result, this mine reduced their cyanide consumption by 5%, saving them 5,500 USD a day, or 2 million USD per year. It allowed for 2% higher recovery rates which added 20 million USD to their bottom line.

## Cyanide action in plants — from toxic to regulatory | SpringerLink
Cyanide is produced in plant tissues as the result of hydrolysis of cyanogenic compounds and is also released as a co-product of ethylene biosynthesis. Most cyanide produced in plants is detoxified primarily by the key enzyme β-cyanoalanine synthase. The remaining HCN at non-toxic concentration may play a role of signaling molecule involved in

## Cyanide - Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security
Cyanide is a naturally occurring chemical, found in many plants, that has been used in conventional warfare and poisoning for 2 millennia. It is highly lethal, whether inhaled as a gas, ingested in solid form, or absorbed through topical exposure. Two notorious incidents in recent history-the Jonestown Massacre in 1978 and the Tylenol
