## The pros and cons of cone crusher applications - Quarry
A cone crusher in a secondary crushing application will typically work with a 3.5:1 to 5:1 reduction ratio. Tertiary cone crusher configurations typically work with a reduction ratio of 2.5:1 to 4:1. The reduction ratio is defined as the ratio of the feed size for which 80 per cent will pass (F80), divided by the product size for which 80 per

## What Do You Need To Know About Cone Crusher Working Principle
The working principle of the cone crusher is very similar to the gyratory crusher. The shaft of the cone crusher is driven by a powerful motor which forces the axle of the cone crusher wings to swing, so the crushing walls, known as a mantle and a bowl liner, are face to face. This zone is called the crushing zone.

## Cone Crusher - JXSC Machine
【Cone Crusher Working Principle】While the eccentric shaft rotating, the materials are continuously squeezed and compressed between the moving and fixed steel, thus the materials gradually become smaller and pass down through the discharge port. The required final size is adjustable and determined by the gap between the two crushing steel at
