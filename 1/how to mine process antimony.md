The cleaned antimony concentrate is pumped to a Spiral Rake Thickener to remove excess water prior to filtering. A Adjustable Stroke Diaphragm Pump meters the thickened flotation concentrate to a Disc Filter. Where water must be reclaimed for re-use, the rougher tailings are thickened in a Spiral Rake Thickener and the plant water is reclaimed.

## Antimony | History to Go
Antimony mining saw a resurgence in the Coyote area around WWI. It was a short-lived boom, ending with the war. So much Antimony was taken out of the area, however, that the settlers decided to rename the town Antimony in 1920. The New Deal years saw the implementation of a culinary water system. Antimony made a large contribution to America

Then they shovel the ore onto loaders and trucks, and haul it to a shaft.
