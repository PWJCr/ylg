## Ore Processing | OceanaGold - Waihi Operation
Grinding and Sizing. Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with

## Comminution | Multotec
The process of comminution is the crushing and grinding of a material / ore to reduce it to smaller or finer particles. The comminution process reduces particle sizes by breaking, crushing, or grinding of ore, rock, coal, or other materials. The process is most often used in the field of mining and / or mineral processing, where mineral ore is broken down into small particles, by hammer

## 3 Principles of Choosing the Crushing and Grinding Process
Crushing and grinding operations are important for the entire mineral processing process, as well as two operations with huge investment and high energy consumption. In terms of metal mines, the equipment investment of crushing and grinding operations accounts for 65% ~ 70% of the total investment in the whole plant, and the power consumption is about 50% ~ 65%.

## Mineral Processing - SlideShare
The mineral beneficiation involves separation of gangue minerals from ore. It has three steps Liberation, Separation, Concentration. 1) Liberation of valuable mineral by size reduction. 2) Separation of coarse and fine particles. 3) Concentration to separate the gangue minerals to increase the metal grade.
