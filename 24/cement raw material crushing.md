## Cement Raw Material Millingerprocess
The wet process requires 0.28 tonnes of coal and 110 kWh of power to manufacture one tonne of cement, whereas the dry process requires only 0.18 tonnes of coal and 100 kWh of power. The major operations carried out in the cement raw material milling are as follows: Crushing of limestone, coal, and other materials.

## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Since a form of calcium carbonate, usually limestone, is the predominant raw material, most plants are situated near a limestone quarry or receive this material from a source via inexpensive transportation. Cement manufacturing begins with quarrying operations in which limestone in mines is quarried and brought to crusher for crushing.

## Cement Raw Material Crushing
Raw material crushing and pre homogenization dry,during cement manufacturing process, the majority of raw materials, including limestone, clay, iron ore, coal, etc. will be crushed. specifically, due to larger granularity and higher hardness, the crushing of limestone that is maximally consumed in cement process plays critical role in the raw material crushing.

## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6 inches.

The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.
