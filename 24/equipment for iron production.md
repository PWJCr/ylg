## What Was Iron Used For In The Industrial Revolution
What is the iron industry used for? As an integral component in the formation of steel iron ore is the world's most commonly used metal and critical to nearly every industry from energy and construction to transportation and equipment manufacturing. Beyond its applications iron ore production is an economic stimulant essential to U.S. growth.

The Iron-Carbon System. Iron-carbon alloys containing from a very small amount (about 0.03%) to about 1.2% carbon, 0.25 to 1.00% manganese, and minor amounts of other elements are termed plain-carbon steels. However, for purposes of this section of the book, plain-carbon steels will be treated as essentially iron-carbon binary alloys.

## Iron Ore Processing - Prominer (Shanghai) Mining Technology Co.,Ltd.
Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Steel
Origins and production. Iron is commonly found in the Earth's crust in the form of an ore, usually an iron oxide, such as magnetite or hematite.Iron is extracted from iron ore by removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon which is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This process, known as smelting, was first applied to metals with

## Iron Element; Uses, Production, and Prices - Mechanicalland
Pig iron production is a very important intermediate process between the production of pure elements and steel and cast iron. Furthermore, they are produced after the production of pure element with the redox process. 5-6% of carbon is added to the pure element to obtain it. This is used by different producers to produce cast iron or steel.

Increase in the productivity of blast furnaces The productivity of a blast furnace increased with charging DRI with large metallic iron content to it. (When 100 kg of DRI is used for the production of 1 ton of molten iron, the production of molten iron increases by 10 - 15 %.) 4.

## Evolution of Blast Furnace Iron Making - IspatGuru
Fig 4 Evolution of BF top equipment. As the BF production increased due to many design improvements, removal of liquid products (iron and slag) became an issue. Production of charcoal BF had increased over the period from one ton to 25 tons per day.  As iron production increased, the purest iron ores were depleted in many areas so lower
