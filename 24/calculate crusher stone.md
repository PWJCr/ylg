To find the volume needed, determine the amount of area to be covered by gravel as well as the desired depth of the gravel. The ideal depth of gravel varies depending on the application, but a minimum of 2-4 inches of gravel is a workable baseline. Multiplying the area to be covered by the desired depth yields the volume of gravel you will need.
