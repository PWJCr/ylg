## How to improve jaw crusher performance and productivity
As excessive wear can cause a 10-20% reduction in production, it is important to find the optimal time for the jaw turn or change in terms of cost and benefit. Again, with the same scenario with C130, we would have approximately a 70 stph reduction in production, in other words, a decrease of USD 4000 to 8000 in revenue for one day.

## What are the Different Types of Aggregate Crushers?
An aggregate crusher is a machine designed to grind or pulverize various types of rock into small, relatively uniform pieces. Aggregate crushers are used in mining, quarrying and recycling operations. Several types of crushers can perform this task including jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, impact crusher and cone crushers,. An aggregate crusher can be relatively small, like the mobile units
