Abstract. Although the presence of Upper Coal Measures under the Mesozoic rocks around Burford has been known for nearly 100 years, productive Westphalian was proved for the first time in this area by the IGS Apley Barn borehole, near Witney, where Upper Carboniferous strata were entered at 250-19 m. Two further boreholes, at Steeple Aston

The coal measures occupy about 16,700 acres (6,758 ha), overlying beds of Millstone Grits. [2] The coalfield, a raised basin plateau of Paleozoic rocks that were folded in the Variscan Orogeny, [a] was formed during the Upper Carboniferous period, when the area was an intertidal environment of estuaries and swamps.
