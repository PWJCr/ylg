At the processing plant, the taconite is crushed into very small pieces by rock crushing machines. The crushers keep crushing the rock until it is the size of a marble. The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. Separation The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Mining iron ore typically involves finding a fertile site, drilling and blasting the ore, and then transporting it to the primary crusher for processing. Crushed ore is sorted over screens and resized to different specifications (lump and refined products). After the processing, a stacker builds a stockpile in the stockyards.
