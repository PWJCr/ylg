## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Cone Crushers Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the primary crusher. Cone crushers are more often used for 2nd, 3rd & 4th stage crushing steps (although not always).

## The pros and cons of cone crusher applications - Quarry
A measure of the size reduction achieved for a particular crusher application is the reduction ratio. A cone crusher in a secondary crushing application will typically work with a 3.5:1 to 5:1 reduction ratio. Tertiary cone crusher configurations typically work with a reduction ratio of 2.5:1 to 4:1.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

A first-stage crusher, such as an impact or jaw crusher is used to break raw material down to a size that the cone crusher can accommodate. Cone crushers are typically looked at as a secondary or tertiary stage of crushing. But, they can also act as the first stage provided the material is small enough to fit through the feed opening.

## 12 tips to maximize cone crusher productivity - Metso Outotec
A crusher should be operated above 40% but below 100% rated horsepower in order to maximize cone crusher productivity and to have a proper "loaded bearing alignment". An optimal power range is to operate between 75%-95%. Operating a crusher above 110% rated power can cause premature crusher failure.

The study also shows that the recirculating load is higher with the VSI than with the cone crusher. Compared to the cone crusher, the VSI product contained 65% more material smaller than 1mm while at the same time consuming less power. An alternative energy measure was introduced to assess the value of feeding a finer product to a grinding mill.
