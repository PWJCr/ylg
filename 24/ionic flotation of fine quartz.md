Primary monoamines have been long used and studied as flotation collectors for quartz. In the past several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the manner in which the amines adsorb onto and render the mineral hydrophobic and, thus, floatable. From past data and proposed mechanisms and reinterpreting some of the past data it appears that somewhat different mechanisms account for amine

The flotation of sulphides and quartz from calcite is possible while using an amine collector at neutral or mildly alkaline pH values where the amines are present in mono and doubly charged ions. Optimum results were also observed above pH 10, where the neutral amine molecules are in colloidal precipitate form interacting with the sulphides

## Ionic Flotation Of Fine Quartz Stone Crusher Machine
ionic flotation of fine quartz. Handbook of Flotation Reagents6.16 Мб. This is because the ionic composition of the pulp and the presence of various ultra- fine clay minerals have a dramatic effect on the frothing properties and froth stability in the flotation pulps.In the flotation of quartz, it is known that heavy-metal cations (Cu, Pb, Fe) act as activators for quartz
