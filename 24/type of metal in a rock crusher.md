## Different types of crushing equipments - Constro Facilitator
Types of crusher depend on the feeding method. These are- Primary crusher, Secondary crusher and Tertiary crusher. The primary crusher is only for the breaking of large stones into pieces (this means primary crusher is not for the aggregate size material.). Examples of primary crushers are jaw crusher; hammer mill crusher and gyratory crusher.

## Unlike natural roundl-restaurierung
Crusher-run gravel compacts well but does not drain very fast -- at least not as fast as 3/4-inch crushed stone (no fines). Talk to a soils engineer if you are worried -- but in my experience, either crusher-run gravel (compacted) or 3/4-inch crushed stone can be used under footings. So can rigid foam. An engineer may disagree.
