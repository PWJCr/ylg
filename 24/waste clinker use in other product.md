## Energy Use - Cement
Energy Use. A cement manufacturing plant requires significant amounts of energy to produce clinker, the main ingredient in cement. Energy in the form of electricity is required to prepare the raw meal (typically limestone, clay, sand and iron ore), run the kiln and, in integrated cement plants, to grind the clinker, gypsum and other materials to produce cement in grinding mills.

Lime, on the other hand, will harden due to the reaction with carbon dioxide from the air. Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color.

Cement is produced by burning mixtures of limestone, minerals, and other additives at high temperatures in a special rotary kiln. Hot air mixing with the raw materials creates a chemical reaction and produces "clinker," marble-sized pellets and sand-sized particles. The clinker is removed from the kiln, cooled, finished, and ground for bagging.

Solid waste is mixed into other raw materials, dried and ground in a dryer mill, and burnt in a kiln equipped with a new suspension pre-heater (NSP). During these processes, the waste, together with other raw materials, becomes clinker. This clinker and about 3% gypsum are mixed and ground together to make the final cement product.

In order to realize low energy consumption in cement and the recycling of solid waste, the phase composition and structure of waste mortar used to prepare a high belite cement clinker, instead of some other raw materials, have here been investigated, and the belite was activated by doping with SO3. The results show that a good high belite cement clinker can be obtained using waste mortar
