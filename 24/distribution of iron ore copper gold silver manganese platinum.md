## Mineral Processing And Extractive Metallurgy : 100 Years Of Innovation 
This depends on the grade of the ores: gold grades are around 1 g gold/tonne of ore, copper ore contain around 1% metal, while iron ore with a grade of around 60%. The production of ores containing PGMs is however much smaller, only 100 Mt. Most ores are produced in open pit operations, as much as 85% varying from metal to metal.

For example, decorative gold artifacts dating from the late Stone Age are known, and some gold Egyptian coins are more than 5000 yr old. Copper is almost as ancient, with objects dating to about 5000 BC. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin that is harder than either of its constituent metals, was used before 3000 BC, giving rise to the Bronze Age.
