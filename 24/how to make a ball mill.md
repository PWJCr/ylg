## Ball Milling 101 - Skylighter Fireworks Making
Jay on June 20, 2012 at 3:11 PM. I bought some 'hardened lead' milling balls from skylighter. I milled some fine charcoal and threw it away (as mentioned earlier to clear any wax or oils off the balls). Then I milled a measured amount of KNO3 . When the balls went IN they were shiney (almost like chrome)..when they came OUT they were dull

Use strong, precise toolholders. High-precision holders are crucial when hard milling to achieve maximum tool life. Run-out must be limited to less than .0004-inch to maximize tool life. Machinists can achieve this level of precision with most shrink-fit holders, milling chucks, high-precision collet chucks and select end-mill holders.

## Temperature Reduction for Ball Mill Optimization | Lechler US
One potential method is strengthening the internal and external ventilation of the grinder. Heat taken away by ventilation systems can accounts for roughly 20% of the total heat discharged by the ball mill. Improving that ventilation system brings more cool air into the inside of the ball bill, gradually reducing the internal temperature.
