There were plans for a 1,200 megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant in Kogi, a coal-rich state in central Nigeria. However, the project has been repeatedly shelved due to financing issues. In 2011, the government announced that it intends to build two more coal plants, but plans for these have not yet emerged.

To address this, Nigeria is adding nine new gas plants to its fleet. But that alone is not sufficient. Nigeria's current power generation is around 5,000 MW, while the ideal capacity would be around 30,000 MW. Coal could meet the future electricity demand.
