## coal mining - Underground mining | Britannica
In a continuous operation, one machine—the continuous miner—rips coal from the face and loads it directly into a hauling unit. In both methods, the exposed roof is supported after loading, usually by rock bolts. Under favourable conditions, between 30 and 50 percent of the coal in an area can be recovered during development of the pillars.

Dec 10, 2020 Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Mining vehicles - a ride through time - Mining Technology
It is unclear exactly when the first continuous mining vehicle was developed. The English Channel Machine built in the 1870s and ran on compressed air could possibly be counted, but most agree that the technology was first used in mining in the early 1900s.

Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.
