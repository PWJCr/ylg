What is Recycled Concrete Aggregate? Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) — also called "crushed concrete" — is made up of asphalt debris from other construction projects that can be reused to create driveways, pathways, garden beds and more.. When any concrete structure, road, sidewalk or parking lot is destroyed, that concrete is often deposited in a landfill.
