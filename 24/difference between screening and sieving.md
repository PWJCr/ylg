## What is the Difference Between Screening Mammogram and Diagnostic 
The key difference between screening mammogram and diagnostic mammogram is that a screening mammogram is a simple x-ray taken without any signs or symptoms of breast cancer, while diagnostic mammogram is a more detailed x-ray done based on signs and symptoms of breast cancer.. A mammogram is an x-ray image of the breast. It is usually done to detect breast cancer with or without symptoms and

Inclined Screens. The vibrating Inclined Screen is the most popular type of screen. There are various types of Inclined Screens, including two and four bearing, high-speed, and high-frequency screens. The overwhelming majority of installations today are either two or three decks, though there are single and four-deck varieties available as well.

## The difference between banana sieve and conventional vibrating sieve
The main difference between it and the conventional screen is the setting of the screen surface. In order to increase the penetration rate of the inclined surface of the feed end, the banana screen has a long groove with movable sieve holes, and its length-to-width ratio is 4:1, which has a good penetration rate for fine particle screening.

Dry test sieves are available in both half-height and full-height sieves. Half height sieves can be used on a sieve shaker to allow more sieves to fit into the sieve stack on your machine. Wet test sieves are all manufactured with a height of 4 inches. This height is what allows the sample more room when you add the wet solution.

The process of threshing is done by striking the stems of harvested crops against An hardsurface. Sieving is done for separation of very small size of impurity like dust and small bugs found in grains etc.
