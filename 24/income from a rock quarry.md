## What Exactly Goes on in a Rock Quarry? - Coyle Stone
A rock quarry is mining for big rocks that are eventually made into smaller rocks or sand. Then they are sold to builders or contractors where they are made into bridges, highways and roadways, houses, and shopping malls. You'll also find the rock in your church or your kid's schools and even in the office building where you work.
