## So, You Found Gold in Quartz? (What's It Worth?) - Rock Seeker
Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm. Without exact measurements, this test is more promising than conclusive, but gold will stick out like a sore thumb if you have another, similarly-sized piece of quartz for comparison. Scratch/Streak Test- Pyrite and chalcopyrite scrape glass, gold won't.

extracting raw gold from quartz. Rcovery of gold in pyritic ores - Mine Engineer.Com. Gravity concentration tends to recover the pyrite with the gold, and only removes the lighter minerals, such as quartz, from the ore. The most difficult particles to gravity concentrate are the fines, and 75 microns to 2 microns are definitely very fine.
