## Coal Mining in India - ClearIAS
Coal demand in the country is yet to peak as the Economic Survey projects coal demand in the range of 1.3-1.5 billion tonnes by 2030, an increase of 63 percent from the current demand. Thus, as of now, there is no scenario of energy transition away from coal affecting any stakeholders involved in coal mining.

## Surface Mining Techniques | Axora
Surface Mining Techniques. Surface mining is a broad term that includes techniques used to extract minerals near the Earth's surface. One technique is strip mining, where the overburden is removed using dozers, draglines, or scrapers, depending on the terrain. Horizontal trenches are then dug for the removal of materials.

## Coal extraction method -surface, deep underground mining techniques
Underground mining: Coal at a depth of 180 to 300 ft (50 to 100 m) is deep mined, however in some cases the technique of surface mining are implemented. Underground mining is undergone when the coal is present at the depth of 180 to 350 feet. Room and pillar mining and longwall mining are the two types of underground mining.

Most underground coal is mined by the room and pillar method, where by rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air.Generally, rooms are 2,000 feet wide and the pillars up to 300 feet wide.

Underground Mining. · Opencast mining, also known as surface mining or strip mining, has disadvantages that include disturbance of the environment and local ecosystems, exposure of radioactive elements and contamination of freshwater sources. The use of heavy machinery and blasting techniques also create environmental pollution.

In surface mining, the ground covering the coal seam (the overburden) is first removed to expose the coal seam for extraction.

## Coal mining
Coal that occurs at depths of 55 to 90 m (180 to 300 ft) are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of 60 m (200 ft) are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam 20-25 metres (60-90 feet). Coals occurring below 90 m (300 ft) are usually deep mined.

Coal Mining Technologies. Surface mining of coal requires areas of land to be temporarily disturbed, which raises a number of environmental challenges. As coal mining is only a temporary use of land, a rehabilitation or reclamation plan is designed for each mine covering the period from the start of operations until well after mining has finished.

In Australia, the majority of coal mining is done via the opencast method, although often the method of choice is dependent on certain characteristics of the coal deposit 1..

Hydraulic mining was a variation on ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff, thereby washing away tons of boulders, gravel, dirt, and gold. The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853. Mattison delivered the water through a rawhide.

Surface mining is used when the coal seam is near the surface. It recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited - 90% or more of the coal can be recovered. How does it work?

Surface mining is the technique used for coal seams that lie near the surface because, in such cases, minimum overburden removal will be needed to extract every ton of coal being mined.
