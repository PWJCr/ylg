## bond crushing work index calculation formula
Bond Work Index . The Bond work index ( Bond, 1960) is based on Bond''s law, which states that the energy consumed is proportional to the 1.5 power of particle size rather than the square of Rittinger''s law. Accordingly, the energy consumed in reducing the particle size from x F to x p (both measured as 80% undersize) is given by.
