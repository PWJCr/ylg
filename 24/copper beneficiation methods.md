## CNB - Beneficiation method for copper nickel sulfide ore 
The invention relates to a beneficiation method for copper nickel sulfide ore. The beneficiation method is characterized in that a beneficiation process of the method comprises the following steps of: grinding crude copper nickel ore; preferably floating copper mineral from the ground crude ore; performing copper selection on the obtained rough copper concentrate I for five times to obtain

## copper copper beneficiation methods
May 30, 2020 Copper ore beneficiation methods Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.
