## Geophysical Approaches to Coal Exploration - Missouri University of 
The exploration for minerals by geophysical means has been confined largely to the search for hydrocarbons and metallics while appli­ cations to coal exploration are somewhat limited. However, the surface reflection seismic technique has been successfully applied not only to delineating coal deposits but also as a tool in mine exploitation.

Bodie. If you blink, you may just miss the ghost town of Bodie. Located a dozen miles north of the "town" of Wauconda on Highway 20, the old mining town of Bodie is a classic ghost town in Washington . The town had a short history, removing gold from the nearby hills and operating as a mining spot in the late 1800s through the early 1900s.

## Exploration | Coal Mines
Drilling is the most reliable method of gathering information about a coal deposit and the mining conditions. It provides physical samples of the coal and overlying strata for chemical and physical analysis. Spacial Patterns Numerous factors are associated with a drilling program. One is the spatial pattern of the holes in an exploration area.

## Coal Geology | Geoscience Australia
Mining Coal is mined by both surface or 'opencut' (or opencast) and underground or 'deep' mining methods, depending on the local geology of the deposit. Underground mining currently accounts for about 60 per cent of world coal production but around 80 per cent of Australia's coal is produced from opencut mines.

Where possible, the linkages between basic geology and mineral exploration or mining applications have been highlighted. Chapter 3 also in-cludes a survey of 10 common mineral deposit types that will serve as a valu-able reference. Chapter 4 discusses mineral exploration and includes business. "/>

## Antarctica
Antarctica (/ æ n ˈ t ɑːr k t ɪ k ə / ()) is Earth's southernmost and least-populated continent.Situated almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle and surrounded by the Southern Ocean, it contains the geographic South Pole.Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, being nearly twice the size of Australia and larger than Europe, and has an area of 14,200,000 km 2 (5,500,000 sq mi).

## Coal Geology - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Exploration for UCG is different from that for underground coal mining since UCG requires much better understanding of coal geology and hydrogeology. As in exploration for coal mining, the rules and specifications are dependent on local geologic conditions. The main difference lies in defining requirements for hydrogeologic testing.
