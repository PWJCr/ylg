## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
Most of the gold found by miners is taken from gold ore, not nuggets or flakes. The ore is usually brown, a metallic iron color, or mixed with a large white quartz rock that has very little gold in it. Gold is heavy and highly malleable. Gold will not change color, crumble, or tarnish, and is unaffected by most solvents.

The first step towards finding that gold is to crush the ore. The ore is placed in a ball mill (like the one below) - a barrel-like machine filled with metal balls - and rotated until the ore is crushed into a fine powder. Step 2: Processing The Crushed Ore For most artisanal gold miners, step 2 involves the use of toxic mercury.
