Fig 1 A typical open pit iron ore mine. On the basis of mining methods, iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely manual mining and mechanized mining. Large iron ore mines are mechanized mines while manual mining methods are employed in the small mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores.
