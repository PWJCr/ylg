The Mountain Pass Mine, owned by MP Materials, is an open-pit mine of rare-earth elements on the south flank of the Clark Mountain Range in California, 53 miles (85 km) southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada.In 2020 the mine supplied 15.8% of the world's rare-earth production. It is the only rare-earth mining and processing facility in the United States.

Jun 21, 2022Introduction to Rare earth elements. The global demand for rare earth elements is growing. Australia is the 4 th largest producer of rare earths in the world, and it holds 3.4% of the worlds rare earth resources. As critical minerals, rare earths elements processing is a new industry, which makes rare earth projects riskier compared to lithium projects which have a well-documented history.

Rare earths are used in the renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines, batteries, catalysts and electric cars. Current mining, processing and sustainability aspects have been described in this paper. Rare earth availability is undergoing a temporary decline due mainly to quotas being imposed by the Chinese government on export and action taken against illegal mining operations.
