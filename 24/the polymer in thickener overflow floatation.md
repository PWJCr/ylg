the polymer in thickener overflow floatation. Nov 01, 1990 The combination polymers produced the best quality of overflow and underflow. For this polymeric condition, change in the feed solids concentration was the most sensitive factor in the maintenance of the overflow quality, and the feed pH was the most sensitive factor for the maintenance of underflow quality.

## Thickener Feed System Design
It is critical to introduce the incoming thickener feed in an even and concentric manner in order to overcome short circuiting of fine unsettled solids into the overflow launder. In the past, uneven distribution and the related short circuiting of unsettled solids were overcome by adding more polymer or providing larger sedimentation vessels.
