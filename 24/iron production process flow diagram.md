Generalized Process Flow Diagram A general flow diagram for the production of raw steel from iron ore is presented in Exhibit 2. In general, the process involves (1) beneficiation of the iron ore, (2) either direct-reduction or reduction in an iron blast furnace, (3) processing in steelmaking furnaces, and (4) casting.

## How is Steel Made? Steel Production Process (With PDF)
To produce steel first the iron ore is heated and melted in a furnace. The impurities are then removed from the molten iron. Carbon and other required alloying elements are added to make steel. Modern-day steel making is highly improved and specialized. There are two processes that are widely popular for modern-day steel making.

## Bessemer process
The Bessemer process was the first inexpensive industrial process for the mass production of steel from molten pig iron before the development of the open hearth furnace.The key principle is removal of impurities from the iron by oxidation with air being blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.

## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
When the iron ore is extracted from the mine, it must undergo several processing stages. Six steps to process iron ore 1. Screening We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.

Step 1 - The production of molten iron The Primary Concentrate is mixed with limestone and coal and heated. The iron oxides are reduced in the solid state to metallic iron, which then melts, and the impurities are removed either as slag or gas. The flow diagram for this process is shown in Figure 1. 5.

## What is a Process Flow Diagram? - An Easy Guide with Tricks - Edrawsoft
Process Flow Diagram (PFD) is a commonly used chart in chemical engineering and process engineering demonstrating the ongoing production flow of chemicals and other types of equipment involved.. The concept of the process flow diagram was first pointed out by Frank Gilbreth, an American industrial engineer, in the 1920s.
