## Methods to Separate Metal From Ore - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Hydrometallurgy. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity.

## Metal Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Metal Ore. Ore metals are extracted from country rocks during water-rock interaction, and sulfate is predominant over sulfide in the mineralizing fluids, which means that sulfide must be provided or generated by reduction at the site of deposition (Ohmoto and Goldhaber, 1997).  Mining of coal and metal ores generates vast amounts of waste

## How Is Ore Mined? - Realonomics
How Is Ore Mined? When miners find rock containing mineral ore they first extract the rock from the earth. . The rock is then crushed by powerful machinery. Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smelting or electrolysis. Smelting uses heat to separate the valuable metal from the rest of the ore. May 7 2011

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
