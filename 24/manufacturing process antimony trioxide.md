## Antimony Trioxide | Tradeasia International
Brief Overview. Antimony trioxide, commonly known as ATO and has chemical formula of Sb2O3, is a commercial compound derived from antimony. Antimony is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust. ATO is a white, odorless crystalline (sand-like) powder. It is an amphoteric oxide, which can dissolve both in ukraine and acidic solutions.

## manufacturing process antimony trioxide
The present invention relates to new rhombohedral antimony trioxide pigments ard to a process of manufacturing the same. Antimony trioxide exists in two modifications, the cubic and the rhombohedral forms. Both the forms are found in nature, the cubic form as seanarmontite and the rhombohedral form as valentinite.

## Polyethylene terephthalate
One process for making PET uses bis(2-hydroxyethyl)  is a metalloid element that is used as a catalyst in the form of compounds such as antimony trioxide (Sb 2 O 3) or antimony triacetate in the production of PET. After manufacturing, a detectable amount of antimony can be found on the surface of the product. This residue can be removed with
