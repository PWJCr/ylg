## The History of Jaw Crushers and Cone Crushers
The first cone crusher was developed by the Symons brothers to improve secondary and tertiary crushing applications. While jaw crushers provide excellent primary crushing duties, new ways of crushing needed to be devised for finer and more consistently sized aggregates. In 1920, the Symons brothers created the first cone crusher.

## Hammermill Crushers | McLanahan
Hammermill Crushers are known to generate material finer than 3/16" (4mm), which in some applications may be undesirable. However, if there is a market for finer material, or if it is acceptable within the desired product size, Hammermills can achieve reduction ratios that may otherwise require multiple crushers.

## Different types of crushers for distinctive needs - Metso Outotec
Dec 17, 2020All rock crushers can be classified as falling into two main groups. Compressive crushers that press the material until it breaks, and impact crushers that use the principle of quick impacts to crush the material. Jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers operate according to the compression principle.

## Does crushing a rock from a different chemical substance?
Does crushed rock absorb water? Unlike ground covers such as organic mulch, gravel does not absorb moisture. Gravel particles shun precipitation, allowing moisture to move away from the building's foundation. A gravel layer that is 2 to 3 inches thick suffices, and too much gravel can impede water's movement.
