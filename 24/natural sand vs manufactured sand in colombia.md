## natural sand - Yahoo Search Results
Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical. Spherical particles decrease the percentage of voids within the concrete mixture so no additional paste is required to fill these voids. Well-shaped natural sands are ideal for workability of mixtures.

## The Difference Between Manufactured Sand, Natural River Sand, Mountain 
Natural sand is a particle smaller than 4.75 mm in diameter formed by natural rock through natural weathering, transportation and accumulation.
