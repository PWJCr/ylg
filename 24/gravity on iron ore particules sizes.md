Description. Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH).n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3).

## Gravity separation of ultra-fine iron ore in the REFLUX TM Classifier
The REFLUX™ Classifier is a recently developed water-based gravity separation technology that is already being used worldwide to beneficiate particles above 0.100 mm in size.

## gravity on iron ore particules sizes
effect of particles size on flotation of gold ore. 1 Grinding Particle Size Both large ore particles (larger than 01mm) and small ore particles (less than 0006mm) affect flotation efficiency and mineral recovery In the case of flotation coarse particles, due to the heavyweight, it is not easy to suspend in the flotation machine, and the chance of collision with the bubbles is reduced

## Investigation on Iron Ore Grinding based on Particle Size Distribution 
The specific gravity of the particles range between < 5.10 and > 4.75 in which 82% is about hematite and about 18% is an association of quartz with hematite.  The iron ore blend takes RT of 13 min when grounded in the BBM for 250% circulating load with 80% passing particle size of 56 µm. The blend iron ore sample obtained from the BBM is
