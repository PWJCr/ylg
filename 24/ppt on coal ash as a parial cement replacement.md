It was observed that the workability decreases with increase in the percentage replacement of bottom ash in concrete. Hamza A.F et al; [6], studied the nomograph of self- compacting mix incorporating coal bottom ash as partial replacement of fine aggregates at the range (0-30) % with w/c ratios 0.35, 0.40 and 0.45.

##  A Study on Effect of Partial Replacement of Cement by Cattle Bone Ash 
Jan 23, 2021The study was aiming to investigate the effect of partial replacement of cement by cattle bone ash (CBA) in a concrete property. Complete silicate analysis of CBA shows that the material has high calcium oxide content (43.26%) which is the major oxide compound of cement. A C-25 concrete grade was selected for this study.

## Potential CO 2 reduction and cost evaluation in use and  - PubMed
Coal ash can potentially be utilized as partial replacement for cement in concrete and mortar formulations. The use of coal ash can lessen the cost and energy production, and reduce the impact on the environment. At present, the annual coal ash generation amounts to ~2.78 Mt and may reach to ~13.02 Mt by 2035 in the Philippines.
