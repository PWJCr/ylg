## The 2020 Practitioners Guide to Magnesium | Metabolics
Magnesium is an alkaline earth metal and the fourth most common mineral in the human body. It occurs as the free cation, a positively charged ion, Mg2+ in aqueous solutions or as the mineral part of compounds, including chlorides, carbonates and hydroxides. In the body, approximately 60% of magnesium is stored in bones and 25% in muscle.
