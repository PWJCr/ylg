## XPS and FTIR spectroscopic study on microwave treated high phosphorus 
XPS survey scans of high phosphorus iron ore indicated the presence of Fe, O, Si, Ca and P (Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15). It can be seen that the shift in the Fe (2p) peak binding energy corresponds to iron oxide as a main component of the iron ore whereas the shift in the O (1s) peak corresponds to oxygen, phosphate and iron oxides speciation.

## What Are the Uses of Magnetite?
The magnetite can be reused in this process 90 percent of the time. Magnetite is also used as a source of iron to manufacture iron-based chemicals and fertilizers. Ferric chloride and ferric sulphate are manufactured with magnetite as one of the starting materials. These chemicals are effective in clarifying raw water in water purification plants.

High Phosphorus Magnetite Iron Ore Uses. Use a high phosphorus iron ore gehirnjogging ruhr de Iron Ore The typical magnetite iron ore concentrate has less than 01 phosphorus 3 7 silica and less than 3 aluminium The grain size of the magnetite and its degree of comingling with the silica groundmass determine the grind size to which the rock must

## High Phosphorus Magnetite Iron Ore Uses - Henan Aluneth Heavy Machinery
Abstract High-phosphorus oolitic iron ore treated by suspended ash magnetic roasting contained 42.73 iron mainly present as magnetite and 0.93 phosphorus present as collophane. Low-intensity magnetic separation LIMS was combined with reverse otation to increase the iron and reduce the phosphorus contents of the roasted product.
