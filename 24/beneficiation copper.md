## Copper Beneficiation Process - JXSC Mineral
Copper Flotation. As a commonly used process for copper ore beneficiation, flotation can be used for the separation of copper sulfide and oxidized copper ores. The main process of copper ore flotation is rough as follows: ore crushing and screening → stage grinding stage flotation → concentration and dehydration → copper concentrate.
