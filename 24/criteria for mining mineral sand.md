## Mineral Sands - An Overview of the Industry - AusIMM
Mineral sands are different to almost any other commodity; however, it shares similarities with other commodity types, such as the importance of quality constraints of iron ore and coal or the importance of physical properties of diamonds. The mineral sands industry consists of two principal product streams; titanium dioxide minerals - in the form of rutile, ilmenite and leucoxene, and zircon.

Mineral sands mines are usually open pit mines that can use a range of equipment: trucks and excavators, bulldozers, scrapers, monitors and dredges. Of all the ore that is excavated, the economic minerals account for about 5% of the volume. Most of the sand is of no economic value and is returned to the mine void.
