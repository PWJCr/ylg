## Nexus between Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining and  - Hindawi
The study reveals that weak policies regulating artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Ghana are also responsible for the increasing environmental problems. Due to this, non-Ghanaians, particularly, Chinese immigrants, have trooped themselves into illegal small-scale mining, hence, increasing the environmental impacts of ASM in the country.

Gold mining remains one of the drivers of Ghana's economic dynamics. The abundance of gold deposits in Ghana in the pre-colonial days earned the countries the name Gold Coast (Land of Gold). From the pre-colonial days to now post-independence era, the debate on Gold mining visas via illegal mining continues to be a subject of discussion.
