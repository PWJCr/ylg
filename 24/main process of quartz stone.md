## Are Quartz Countertops Stain resistant? Does Quartz Stain?
That's true. However, to understand why quartz stains and how it happens, we need to understand why it is known as a stain-resistant stone. Quartz is an engineered stone. Its composition is of 90-95% quartz crystals, the rest is made out of resins that bind the particles together. These resins are the key to why quartz outstands most natural
