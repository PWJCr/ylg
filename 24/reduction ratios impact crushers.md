## Reduction Ratio - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Reduction Ratio. Reduction ratio (RR) is defined as the ratio of the cross section of the polymer before extrusion to that after extrusion.  At a quarry in western Kenya a secondary impact crusher was included in the aggregate processing design on the basis of the incorrect information that the raw material was a quartz andesite, perhaps

A general rule of thumb for applying cone crushers is the reduction ratio. a crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. thus, with a 3⁄4 closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing.
