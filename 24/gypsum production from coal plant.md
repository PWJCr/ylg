Mineralogically identical to natural gypsum, FGD gypsum, or synthetic gypsum, is produced from gas captured within emission control systems at coal fired electric utilities. An emission that would compromise air quality, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) gas, is the primary contribution coal makes to FGD gypsum.

Gypsum ore, from quarries and underground mines, is crushed and stockpiled near a plant. Asneeded, the stockpiled ore is further crushed and screened to about 50 millimeters (2 inches) in diameter. If the moisture content of the mined ore is greater than about 0.5 weight percent, the ore must be dried in a rotary dryer or a heated roller mill.

power system protection and control Interestingly, gypsum does not alter the pH of the soil (it is not a liming agent). This makes it a great alternative to lime where calcium is needed but the soil pH is adequate.  Sodic soils are prone to erosion, dispersion, and runoffs thus affecting agricultural activities.

## Coal explained Coal and the environment - Energy Information Administration
This coalbed methane must be vented out of mines to make mines safer places to work. In 2019, methane emissions from coal mining and abandoned coal mines accounted for about 8% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 1% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (based on global warming potential). Some mines capture and use or sell the coalbed

Potential emission sources in gypsum processing plants are shown in Figure 11.16-1. While particulate matter (PM) is the dominant pollutant in gypsum processing plants, several sources may  All of these factors are based on output production rates. Particle size data for ore dryers, calciners, and board end sawing operations are shown in
