In either case, the top size of the material ends up typically in the range of 200 - 350 mm, which is good for belt conveyors and fits into most secondary crushers without causing process risks. To achieve this top size, the crusher setting is in the range of 200 mm or below, depending on the rock characteristics.

## Crusher
The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate.

## The Process of Mining Bauxite - Dajcor
Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Milling: Several meters of rock and clay are removed by blasting, drilling, and bulldozers. The bauxite is then transported to the crushing and washing area, reducing the particle size and increasing the available surface area for the digestion stage.

## Mineral and Mining Engineering: What are the differences of crushing 
CRUSHING Crushing is performed in stages using a combination of jaw, cone and impact crushers and is performed dry. The material is moved by mechanical means with conveyor belts. Sometimes the blasting and crushing fines are washed off the ore, and pumped as a slurry directly to the grinding circuit.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores, in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation, 2) thickening, 3) smelting, and 4) electrolysis. Following mining, transporting, and crushing to a consistent gravel or golf ball-size, the crushed ore is further processed at a mill
