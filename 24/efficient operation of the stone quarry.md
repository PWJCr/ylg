Step 3: If the stone is found to be of good quality and it has been approved, the extraction process can begin. Extraction is done by breaking large chunks of the raw material to loosen them and create smaller pieces. Step 4: Once they've been extracted the stone is crushed several times and sorted into similar sizes.

Mining is an underground operation only whereas quarry is carried out on the exposed surface of natural rocks to the light of the sun. Stone quarrying process is generally done in the hilly areas where a large quantity of stone is available. The stone industry is broadly classed as to the uses for which the stone is intended:

Biesanz, which contracts projects from Florida to Utah, is a nationwide leader of dimensional and panel stone. The mining takes place about 100 feet below the surface, where a smooth, horizontal plane of limestone exists. Explosives are used to blast through the overburden, or rock layers between the surface and the dolomite limestone deposits.

Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed. WW2 expedited the development of this machinery, and crushed stone began to be widely used in construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s.
