Typically, in a Metso HP-style crusher, the optimal utilization target is 50 to 55% of the liner. For a Symons-style crusher, targeted utilization should be 60 to 65% to maximize liner use before replacement is required. To calculate liner utilization, weigh the liners before they're installed. Upon removal, weigh them again.

Impact Crushers - VSIs and HSIs. Impact-style crushers include VSIs, as well as horizontal shaft impactors (HSIs), and are best used with less abrasive rock types, like limestone. These types of machines break apart material by the impacting forces of certain wear parts known as blow bars and impact plates or toggles.

Then there is the presence of other elements in the alloy - carbon increases the hardness and wear resistance of the alloy, and chromium helps prevent 'metal growth' (where the liner expands and becomes too large for the crusher). Getting the right ratio of these elements relative to manganese is a delicate balance.
