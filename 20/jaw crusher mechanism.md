Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.

Introduced in 1906, McLanahan's Universal Jaw Crusher was one of the first overhead eccentric jaw crushers. Since that time, this robust design has continued to be the basis of the Universal Jaw Crusher design. In addition to the standard jaw crusher design, McLanahan also produces the H-Series, which features adjust-on-the-fly capabilities.
