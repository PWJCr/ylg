## Coal Shortage Cuts off Power in China's Industrial Heartland
China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that power generation rose by 13 percent in the first seven months of the year, and almost all of the additional capacity came from coal-fired plants.

## Chinese Coal-based Power Plants | Wilson Center
Jun 28, 2022China is Currently Building Over Half of The World's New Coal-based Power Plants. In 2021, China began building 33 gigawatts of coal-based power generation, according to the Helsinki-based Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). That is the most new coal-fired power capacity China has undertaken since 2016 and, says CREA, three

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.

## Solar Panels From Coal-Fired Plants in China more polluting - PJ Media
That's the good news. The bad news is that producing the solar panels in China using coal-fired electrical power plants to generate electricity will produce almost as much CO2 as the fossil fuel

## Global Coal Plant Tracker - Global Energy Monitor
The Global Coal Plant Tracker (GCPT) provides information on coal-fired power units from around the world generating 30 megawatts and above. The GCPT catalogues every operating coal-fired generating unit, every new unit proposed since 2010, and every unit retired since 2000. Units often consist of a boiler and turbine, and several units may make up . Continued
