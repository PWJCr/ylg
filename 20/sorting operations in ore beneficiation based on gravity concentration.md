Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

## A Beneficiation Study on a Low Grade Iron Ore by Gravity and Magnetic 
In this paper, a sample from Tange-zagh iron mine was characterized by gravity and magnetic separation methods. The mineralogical studies showed that hematite and goethite are the main iron-bearing minerals with insignificant amounts of FeO. The results indicated that spiral separation yields higher separation efficiency than others. The combination of spiral and multi gravity methods showed
