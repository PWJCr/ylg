The strength of concrete is controlled by the proportioning of cement, coarse and fine aggregates, water, and various admixtures. The ratio of the water to cement is the chief factor for determining concrete strength. The lower the water-cement ratio, the higher is the compressive strength.

The ' aggregate crushing value test ` gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions, and the strength of the aggregate used in road construction is expressed by numerical index.

For normal concrete and HSC, the concrete compressive strength test results from cube specimens are generally higher than cylinders specimens [6]. As states in BS 1881, the compressive strength of concrete gained by cylinder specimens is equal to 0.8 times of the compressive strength gained by cube specimens.

Generally, bricks have high compressive strength in the range of 5.5 N mm 2 to 140 Nmm 2. If the crushing strength of the bricks is less than 3.5 Nmm 2 it must not be used. A field test about strength of the bricks is to fall the brick from a height of 1 meter and it must not break in to pieces.

Jun 12, 2022For concrete blocks, the compressive strength is typically around 17.5 N/mm2 or 2500 psi. This means that the blocks can support a load of up to 17.5 N per square millimeter before they start to crack. Compressive strength is tested to determine how much compression a concrete block structure can endure.

## Crushing Strength Of Concrete Block
Crushing Strength Of Concrete Solid Blocks. High-strength concrete is specified where reduced weight is important or where architectural considerations call for small support elements. By carrying loads efficiently than normal-strength concrete, high-strength concrete also reduces the total amount of material placed and lowers the overall cost

## crushing strength of concrete block
Properties of Concrete Blocks — Strength. It is probably safe to assume that the minimum crushing strength of well-made blocks, 1 to 5, is 1,000 pounds per square inch at 1 month and 2,000 pounds at 1 year. A block 12 inches wide and 24 inches long has a total surface of 288 square inches, or, deducting ⅓ for openings, a net area of 192 inches.
