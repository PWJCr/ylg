## Amplitude - Definition, Period, Frequency and Characteristics of Sound Wave
The amplitude of a sound wave is the measure of the height of the wave. The amplitude of a sound wave can be defined as the loudness or the amount of maximum displacement of vibrating particles of the medium from their mean position when the sound is produced. It is the distance between the crest or trough and the mean position of the wave.

## High-frequency vibrating screens
The high frequency (1500 - 7200 rpm) and low amplitude (1.2 - 2.0 mm) characteristics leads to the vertical-elliptical movement that rapidly transports oversized particles down the screen. [9] Creating a thin bed of particles, this improves the efficiency and capacity of the screen. The movement pattern of a particle down a vibrating screen.

## Amplitude, Time-Period and Frequency of Vibration
The frequency actually tells us how fast the vibrating object repeats is motion. We can increase the frequency of a simple pendulum by reducing the length of its thread. And we can decrease the frequency of a simple pendulum by increasing the length. Time period is equal to the reciprocal of frequency. Frequency = 1 / Periodic Table.

## Vibrating string amplitude | Physics Forums
The answer is that the thinner lighter string produces less sound. The mathematics you need to show this, is about the energy in the vibrating string. More accurately, it's about the energy that is turned into sound. How does the (mechanical) energy of the vibrating string depend on its tension, thickness and amplitude.
