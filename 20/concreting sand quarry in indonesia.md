## What Are the Mix Ratios for Cement and Sand?
Westend61/Westend61/Getty Images. The basic mix ratio for concrete is one part water, two parts cement and three parts sand. An alternative ratio is one part cement, two parts sand and three parts gravel with enough water added until the mixtures reaches the consistency of thick mud. Lime is also a common additive to the mix.

In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

In normal concrete, the introduction of quarry dust to mixes is limited due to its high fineness. Its addition to fresh concrete would increase the water demand

## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine Aggregate in Concrete
Hence, quarry dust can be effectively used to replace natural sand, without reduction in the strength of concrete. The slight variation is observed in compressive strength for 3 days' and 7 days' age in concrete. As the age of the concrete increases, the compressive strength up to 30 percent replacement of quarry dust also increases.

Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012
