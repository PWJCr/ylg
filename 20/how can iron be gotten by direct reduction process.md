## Direct Reduction Process Description | HeatTreatConsortium
In a direct reduction process, lump iron oxide pellets and/or lump iron ore, are reduced (oxygen removed) by a reducing gas, producing direct reduced iron (DRI). If the cooling stage is omitted, the DRI can be immediately briquetted into hot briquetted iron (HBI). The reducing gas can be generated externally to the reduction furnace, or can be

In the direct reduction process, the solid metallic iron (Fe) is obtained directly from solid iron ore without subjecting the ore or the metal to fusion. Direct reduction can be defined as reduction in the solid state at O2 potentials which allow reduction of iron oxides, but not of other oxides (MnO, and SiO2 etc.), to the corresponding elements.

Process. Direct reduction processes can be divided roughly into two categories: gas-based, and coal-based. In both cases, the objective of the process is to remove the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below 1,200 °C (2,190 °F)).

The direct reduction process uses pelletized iron ore or natural "lump" ore. One exception is the fluidized bed process which requires sized iron ore particles.

Direct reduction, an alternative route of iron making, has been developed to overcome some of these difficulties of conventional blast furnaces.DRI is successfully manufactured in various parts of the world through either natural gas or coal-based technology. Iron ore is reduced in solid state at 800 to 1,050 °C (1,472 to 1,922 °F) either by reducing gas (H2+CO) or coal.

In both cases, the objective of the process is to remove the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below 1,200 °C (2,190 °F)).

Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), also known as Sponge Iron, offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI, iron ore is reduced in its solid state - unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East, South America, India and Mexico.

## Iron oxide
Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen.Several iron oxides are recognized. All are black magnetic solids. Often they are nonstoichiometric. Oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust.. Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides are widespread in nature and play an important role in many geological and biological processes.

## USA - Direct reduction process for producing reduced iron 
The present invention discloses a direct reduction process for producing reduced iron by reducing iron ores and/or pellets with reducing gases, wherein the iron ores and/or pellets are reduced to a degree of reduction of 30-80% by a reducing gas containing 15-40% by volume of methane at a temperature of more than 950° C. and further reduced by a reducing gas containing high proportion of

##  The iron ore importance in Direct Reduction - ENERGIRON
The process is designed for the direct reduction of iron ores (in pellet or in lump form) by the use of reducing gases in a solid-gas moving bed reactor. Oxygen is removed from the iron ores by chemical reactions based on hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO), for the production of highly metallized Direct Reduced Iron (DRI).
