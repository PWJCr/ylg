## Knox Environment Society - Stop the Hanson Quarry Expansion
The Hanson Quarry is one of two open-cut hard rock quarries located on the southern side of 1140 Wellington Rd, Rowville/Lysterfield. Hanson took over from Pioneer concrete in 2000, and the site covers an area of approx. 162ha, and contains substantial reserves of high-quality stone comprising granodiorite and hornfells.

## Carcinogenic Dust - Stop 3009 Vulcan Quarry - Comal County, Texas
Quarry blasting, crushing, and hauling operations emit high levels of carcinogenic particulate matter. Visible dust (larger particles) is also created by movement of front-end loaders, mining trucks, transfer conveyors, excavators, bulldozers, and utility vehicles. Over 80 formal complaints have been filed against Vulcan in Texas alone.

"I can hear the rock crusher going until 10 o'clock at night." The quarry is allowed to operate between 6:00am and 6:00pm Monday to Saturday; a secondary crushing plant can continue until 10:00pm.

The noise created by blasting is sudden, and while it may be brief, the noise created by crushing rock is constant during the quarry operations and can be heard from some distance away. SERIOUS THREATS TO WATERCOURSES: Watercourses are particularly susceptible to quarry operations, particularly runoff and dust.

## Does quarrying cause soil erosion?hcharge
How quarrying affects the rock layers? Quarrying basically destroys landscape. Explanation: Quarries are bad for the environment in several ways. They abruptly interrupt the continuity of open space, ruining habitats for flora and fauna, cause soil erosion, air and dust pollution, damage to caves, loss of land, and deterioration in water quality.

## Quarries - A Solution or a Dust Problem? - Soil Solutions
Quarries. Stone quarrying is a process by which rock is extracted from the ground and crushed to produce aggregate, which is then screened into desired sizes. This screened aggregate is then used for the construction of roads, rail lines, bridges, hospitals, schools, airports, factories, and homes, all of which has crucial impact on economic development of any country.

Mine surfaces tend to pose less of a direct risk to workers.

Are rock quarries noisy? The type and number of possible noise sources will vary depending on the nature and size of the quarry but noise may arise from the operation of mobile equipment within the quarry as well as the extraction process, which may include blasting. The crushing and screening processes may also be potential sources of noise.
