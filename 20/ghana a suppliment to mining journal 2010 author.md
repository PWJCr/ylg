## Review of Environmental and Health Impacts of Mining in Ghana
A study of 252 miners at a large-scale gold mining company in Ghana found that 59 (23%) had noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). 51 Among 59 members of an ASGM community in Nicaragua, 21 (35%) had NIHL. 52 Collectively, these results indicate that ASGM miners may be at substantial risk of NIHL.
