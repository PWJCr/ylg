There are certain parameters for sizing a screw conveyor. The capacity calculation takes into account the outside diameter of the screw, the outside diameter of the pipe or central axis, the screw pitch and the load contained in the trough. The calculation determines the capacity in cubic feet per hour that will be handled with each revolution

## Screw Conveyor - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Screw conveyors can transport grain in either a horizontal, vertical, or inclined position. Screw conveyors become less efficient when they are used to convey material vertically. For conveyors at an inclination of 15 degrees the capacity decreases by about 30%, at an inclination of 25 degrees the capacity decreases by over 55%.

As the angle of inclination increases, the efficiency and load capacity of the screw conveyor decreases while the power requirement increases due to the gravitational pull and fallback of the bulk material. The negative effects of inclination are compensated for by use of a reduced pitch conveyor screw (e.g., one-half or two-thirds of the screw

##  Screw Conveyor
The initial step in engineering a Screw Conveyor is to analyze the physical characteristics of the material and the rate at which it is to be handled. The capacity of a Screw Conveyor should be defined in terms of cubic feet per hour. It is also important to determine the maximum capacity the conveyor will be required to handle.

## Conveyor capacity - How to calculate - Know Industrial Engineering
So, the capacity of the conveyor in 5 minute is ( (505)/25)  2. ie, 20 nos. So the capacity of this particular conveyor is 20 parts in 5 minutes or it will move 1 part in 15 Seconds. Hence the formula for the conveyor capacity is, ( (conveyor speed  time)/ (length of part))  no of parts along width of conveyor.
