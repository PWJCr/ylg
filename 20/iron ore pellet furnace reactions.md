## Blast furnace
The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is: Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2. This reaction might be divided into multiple steps, with the first being that preheated air blown into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the form of coke to produce carbon monoxide and heat: . 2 C (s) + O 2(g) → 2 CO (g). The hot carbon monoxide is the reducing agent for the iron ore and reacts with

Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is

The interaction of these reactions produces a range of atmospheres across the diameter of the pellet that vary from oxidising at the pellet shell to reducing at the pellet core. The model was formulated based on transport equations able to predict the evolution of the temperature profile inside the pellet for each zone on the induration furnace.

The main used reduction reactors are the blast furnace (BF) and direct reduction reactors (DR). In the blast furnace, iron is reduced and melted and the most common product is liquid iron called hot metal.

How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

B. Reduction of the Iron Ore Pellets in TGA Equipment . The reduction of the iron ore pellets were carried out in a thermos gravimetric analysis (TGA) furnace, shown in Fig. 1. With the TGA furnace, we had the capability to change both the gas composition (in-terms of gas flow rate) and temperature during the experiment.

##  The MIDREX Process - The world's most reliable and productive Direct 
In the early days of direct reduction, there was a clearly discernible difference between iron oxide pellets intended for blast furnace use (BF-grade pellets) and those used to make DRI to feed an EAF. A "DR-grade" pellet typically has higher iron content and less silica, alumina and other gangue constituents than "BF-grade" pellets.

## iron ore pellet furnace reactions
Dec 01, 2016 Iron ore (pellet, sinter and lump ore) is gradually reduced to iron in blast furnace. The reductions are a serial of heterogeneous gas solid reactions that take place from the top of the furnace and throughout the shaft region of the furnace. Two major categories of iron ore reaction model had been developed and applied for modeling the iron ore reduction: Un-Reacted shrinking
