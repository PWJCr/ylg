Three things I need to mention: 1) Not all white quartz will contain gold lines. 2) Gold is also found in non-rusty quartz. 3) Some thicker (cruder) gold lines will be iron pyrite. The reason we do the scratch test is to determine if we have located gold of golden colored pyrite. Gold will dent and is soft.

Side hill and drainages on them would be places worthy of prospecting. Look for "float", pieces of quartz that continue uphillcould lead to vein (s). While you are at it, look for elevated benches-ancient stream beds as another source for placer gold. Good luck. Last edited: Aug 23, 2022. and. OP.

Ore shoots can form chemically. During vein formation, hot quartz-rich, acidic fluids will react with rocks of favorable chemistry, particularly rocks with calcium carbonate (limestone). Thus following a vein in any area that may have limestone should lead any prospector to search the limestones for gold and other valuable minerals.
