## Bench Grinder vs. Belt Sander for Sharpening Chisels : woodworking - reddit
Belt sander is a on the job site option but the grinder is the best option with a polishing wheel. I prefer a belt sander for doing heavy grinding. Lets you get a flat/convex bevel rather than a shitty hollow grind. I'd have to buy a lapping plate, wet or dry, a strop, adhesive spray and polishing compound.

## Bench Grinder vs Belt Sander: Which is Better for You?
One main reason is that the bench grinder is specifically made to sharpen tools and other dull implements. There is another good reason why you would choose to use the bench grinder instead of the belt sander. The bench grinder is stationary and locked to the workbench. This allows you to use both hands to get the nice clean edge you need to work.
