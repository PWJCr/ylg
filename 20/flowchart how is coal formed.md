Coal is formed from the physical and chemical alteration of peat. Peat is composed of plant materials that accumulate in wetlands ( bogs and fens), which break down through the process of peatification. If peats are buried, then the peats can be altered into different ranks of coal through the process of coalification.

## Formation of Coal - Definition, Uses & Fossil Fuels with Videos  - BYJUS
Formation of Coal (Process) Coal is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, moisture, and incombustible mineral matter (i.e., ash). Fluorinated gases are not formed by coal combustion. Coals are formed from the accumulation of vegetable debris in specialized environments. Obtaining coal from the mines is a difficult job.

Uses of Coal. It is mainly used to generate heat and electricity. It is used in households and in industries to accomplish various tasks. It is the cheapest source of power fuel. The iron and steel industry depends heavily on fossil fuel for energy. It is also used to produce useful products such as coke, tar, and coal gas.

## How are the coal deposit formed? - Profound-Answers
How is coal formed explain for Class 8? Coal was formed by the decomposition of large land plants and trees buried under the earth 300 million years ago. The slow process by which the dead plants buried deep under the earth have become coal is called Carbonisation. Since coal was formed from remains of plants therefore coal is called a fossil fuel.

## How is coal formed?
Coal is formed by the compacted traces of plants living in marshes million years ago. It was in the Carbon century, when primitive animals first appeared on land. Coal forms from traces of ferns and other primitive animals, covered with mud and buried as a new form of rock. Over millions of years, this material turned into coal.

## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
How coal is formed. Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the plant matter transforms from moist, low-carbon peat, to coal, an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.
