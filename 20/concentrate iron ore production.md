## Copper extraction
Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27-29% copper); the remainder of the concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of pyrite

## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

Iron ore concentrate. Since other production operations except crushing and magnetic sorting are not used in the production of iron ore concentrate, it can have different composition. In the middle belt of Russia there are the most concentrating plants. Their concentrate may contain both pure iron (up to 65%) and its oxides - up to 63%.
