## What crusher dust is - Blog Paragon Gardens
When it comes to a healthy and robust lawn or any other plant, compaction is the enemy. When turf is grown in crusher dust, which means that it is growing in rock, it has shallow root growth causing the plant to always be thirsty and reliant on frequent watering. As we know, this has a disastrous result in times of drought and water restrictions.
