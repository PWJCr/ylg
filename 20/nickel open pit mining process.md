Feb 17, 2021Open pit mining is used for the extraction of both metallic and nonmetallic ores. Open pit mining is considered different from quarrying in the sense that it selectively extracts ore rather than an aggregate or a dimensional stone product.

One process is the ammonia pressure leach, in which nickel is recovered from solution using hydrogen reduction, and the sulfur is recovered as ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. In another, the matte may be roasted to produce high-grade nickel oxides; these are subjected to a pressure leach, and the solution is electro- and carbonyl refined.

## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Open-pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface. If the deposit apexes below the surface, the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open-pit mining. The removal of this material is known as stripping. The stripping-pit limits must be extended beyond the

## Nickel Ore Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
Nickel (element #28, symbol Ni) is a silvery shiny, metallic element. It can be hammered into thin sheets, which means it is malleable. Nickel was discovered in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. Iron, cobalt and nickel (numbers 26, 27 and 28 on the Periodic Table) are the only three elements known to be ferromagnetic (the strongest type of
