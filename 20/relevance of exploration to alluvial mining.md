## Lulo Diamond Mine, Angola - Mining Technology
The alluvial exploration concentrates on a 50km span of the Cacuilo River running through the concession. The first stage of the Alluvial exploration involved the ramping-up of mining operations to a monthly throughput target of 10,000-14,000 bulk cubic metres (bcm) and the second stage aims to ramp-up the throughput to 40,000bcm a month using

The transfer of skills and knowledge of alluvial gold mining took place in the 1950s and 1960s when many residents, especially around the Wau/Bulolo area, applied for and were granted MLs. By the early 1970s, most expatriates who originally held mining leases for small-scale gold mining in the country had transferred their leases to citizens.

Each phase of mining is associated with different sets of environmental impacts. 1.1.1 Exploration A mining project can only commence with knowledge of the extent and value of the mineral ore deposit.  With the alluvial mining, there is a tendency of water and air pollution, depletion of aqua-life, siltation of dams.

## Colonial Mining: A Global Historical Context | SpringerLink
The whole gamut of mining landscapes was present in the florescence of mining activity in the Upper Burnett region from the 1870s to the 1890s—a company town in Mount Perry, rushes to hard rock mines at Eidsvold and alluvial rushes at Cania, dredging at Stanton Harcourt and small scale diggings radiating out from major mining centres.

## Ore Reserve Estimation Method - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Ore-reserve estimates include the determination of (1) tonnages of ore and (2) average grade or value per ton. Since the grade or content of valuable metal establishes the difference between rock that may and may not be classed as ore, tonnage cannot be estimated without considering the question of grade. Consideration of grade in connection
