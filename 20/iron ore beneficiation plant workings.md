## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

Iron ore, its beneficiation and agglomeration - as required for iron and steel industry: A. Iron Ore: A naturally occurring mineral from which iron (Fe) metal is extracted in various forms viz Hot metal/ DRI etc.. B. Types of Ore: Two major varieties used for iron making are Haematite Ore ( containing Ferric Oxide - Fe2O3) and Magnetite Ore (containing Ferro-Ferric Oxide - Fe3O4).

Beneficiation Of Lowoff Grade Iron Ore: A Review. The beneficiation of iron ore is relatively more effective, when raf operation applied along with magnetic concentration. data indicate that it enhance the fe value from 29 of fe to 50 fe. the magnetic operation removes the slimes, which beneficiate the iron ore of 65.22 of fe whereas recovery percentage has been calculated 78.42 (zhu.

Iron ore pelletizing . Iron Ore Pellets are formed from beneficiated or run of mine iron fines The iron is usually ground to a very fine level and mixed with limestone or dolomite as a fluxing agent and bentonite or organic binders as a binding agent If the ore is a Hematite ore coke or anthracite coal can be added to the mix to work as an internal
