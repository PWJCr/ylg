## Explosives used in Rock Blasting - A GRT Review
Explosives are classified into low and high explosives. Low explosives were the earliest to be developed. These lead to an explosion which is really a rapid form of combustion in which the particles burn at their surfaces and expose more and more of the bulk until all is consumed.  Testing of mining explosives with regard to the content of

## What is a high explosive? - Los Alamos National Laboratory
April 1, 2017. High explosives do not need to be contained to make their bang. Explosives are materials that burn or decompose quickly, creating large quantities of gases, which take up much more space than the original materials. Chemical explosives are traditionally divided into two categories: low explosives and high explosives.

Fly rock consists of pieces of rock blown from the shot area by the explosive force. This rock can be lethal because of its, weight and velocity of travel. Flyrock is also caused by a blowout. When a blast hole is not drilled deep enough into the rock, the explosive force blows the rock out into the drift or work area.

Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) are produced by large surface blasts in which the explosive does not detonate properly. NO released by the detonation oxidizes to NO 2 as the fumes mix with the atmosphere. Excessive NO 2 production is apparent as an orange cloud that forms above the blasting site. NO 2 is extremely toxic.
