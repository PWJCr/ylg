## pelletizing iron sand
Iron Ore - an overview. Although iron ore concentrates are generally higher in iron grade and contain lower impurities, the finer size distribution of concentrates limits their usage in iron ore sintering. Therefore, pelletizing is needed to produce fired pellets from concentrates as burden materials for blast furnaces and direct reduction

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.
