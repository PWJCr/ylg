## How the Mill Works - Gray's Grist Mill
Traditionally, the millstone rotates by waterpower. At Gray's Mill, a Sluice Gate was used to start and stop the flow of water from the mill pond across the road. The Sluice Gate was opened by a turning Sluice Wheel, which starts the flow of water, causing the water wheel to turn, thus providing power to grind the grain.

Each floor of the mill has a different function: The cap roof (1): Protects the building from the weather. Holds the cast iron windshaft (2) to which the four sails (3) are attached. Rotates above the curb ring (4) on top of the tower to enable the sails to face the wind. Is turned to face the wind automatically by the six-bladed fantail (5).
