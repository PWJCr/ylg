The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is a simple strength test that compares the bearing capacity of a material with that of a well-graded crushed stone (thus, a high quality crushed stone material should have a CBR @ 100%).It is primarily intended for, but not limited to, evaluating the strength of cohesive materials having maximum particle sizes less than 19 mm (0.75 in.)

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
For example, depending on the region of the United States, crushed stone in the size of a few mm to 2 inches is referred to as "gravel," even if it has been crushed and is no longer smooth. To provide clarity and avoid confusion, we will stay with the definition that gravel cannot refer to crushed stone and must remain in a natural state.

Therefore, we can calculate the Center of Gravity from the front axle to be 208 in - 28.2 in = 179.8 in. Step 3: Use the formula to calculate weight on the rear axle. The Weight on the Rear Axle is 5000 x 179.8/208 = 4322 lb. Step 4: Subtract weight on rear from total weight to find weight on front. This leaves the remaining weight of 5000 lb

##  Effect of New Axle Load Regulation on Commercial Vehicle  - Ijesrt
Roof Crush Test: Roof of the cab should able to withstand a load equal to the front axle load which should be not more than 10T, load has been applied very slowly that is quasistatically and after the test cab deformation should be limited so as not to touch the dummy, roof deformation should not touch driver's head.

## Ballast Specification for High Axle Load & High Speed ≥ 250kmph 
Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that for high axle loads (32.5 T) and high speed ( 250 kmph ) Ballasted Track on PSC sleepers can be adopted. Depth of Ballast of the order of 300 mm. is adequate. Higher size of the ballast is preferred. Ballast material should be Granite/Basalt only.
