For example, the calcium carbonate production process can be divided into two stages: calcination and crystallization. During the calcination stage, limestone is heated at temperatures ranging from 800Â°C to 1,200Â°C to remove impurities and produce calcium oxide (CaO). Afterward, the CaO is mixed with water and then ground into powder.

Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K (from Neo-Latin kalium) and atomic number 19. Potassium is a silvery-white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife with little force. Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives.
