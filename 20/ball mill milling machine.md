## Ball End Mills - Grainger Industrial Supply
Also known as ball-nose end mills, they are rotated against a workpiece to make round-bottomed slots and pockets or mill complex shapes without sharp corners. Each end mill has flutes on its cutting head that carry chips away from the workpiece to prevent damage to the end mill or workpiece. End mills are used on CNC or manual milling machines.

## Ball Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force, as opposed to the Scotch Tape or sonication that mainly use normal force. Ball mills, like the three roll machine, are a common occurrence in industry, for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process, there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.
