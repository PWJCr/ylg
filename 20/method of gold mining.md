Panning. It is a manual method of separating gold from these other substances. Gold may be found in sand and gravel collected in large, shallow pans. To separate the gold from pebbles and other impurities, the pan is dipped in water and agitated vigorously. A pan of gold is quickly depleted of its precious metal content because gold is so much

Alluvial gold is found beneath the surface at the bottom of a creak or stream. Alluvial gold mining is the process of extracting gold from these creaks, rivers and streams and is generally considered to be the most environmentally friendly method of gold mining as a result of the reduced environmental impact when compared to underground mining.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## An Introduction to Placer Gold Mining
The most basic kind of gold placer mining is the using a prospector's pan to swirl sediment-filled water so that unwanted sediment spills out to leave bits of gold behind. This method is based on the fact that gold is heavier than typical sediment. This concept is the foundation for all placer mining techniques. There are two different, but
