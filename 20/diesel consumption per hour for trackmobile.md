## What is the hourly fuel consumption of a 250 cfm compressor  - Answers
250 euros into dollars is $305.74. This is because the ratio of euros to dollars currently is 1:1.22. So 250 multiply by 1.22 = to $305.74. This does vary hourly as the conversion will vary.

This makes it important to know that ethanol free gasoline weighs about 6.2 pounds per gallon and diesel fuel about 6.9 pounds per gallon. On average, a four-stroke gasoline engine will burn about 0.50 pounds of fuel per hour per horsepower. Likewise, a well-maintained diesel engine burns about 0.40 pounds of fuel per hour per horsepower.

A litre of diesel is about 0.84 to 0.86 kilograms (1L=0.8-0.85KG). Most manufacturers of diesel air compressors use g/kw.h to measure the fuel consumption, which means how many grams (g) of oil are consumed in an hour for a generator set of a kilowatt (kw), and then change the unit into liters (L) so that you know the cost of fuel consumption per hour.

## Fuel Consumption - Kubota Tractors - Popular Compact Tractors
 165616. As a general rule of thumb, a modern diesel will use about 1/3 of a pound of fuel, per horsepower, per hour, at peak power. A gallon of Diesel fuel is 7.3 pounds. By that then a 44hp engine will use about 14.5 pounds per hour. That is roughly 2 gallons per hour.

## Fuel Consumption at Idle | The Diesel Stop
If they need to sit for long periods used as a PTO, they should be idled up to about 1250 rpms (min) or what the PTO requirement will be. A 6.4 will regen MUCH more frequently at idle than in it's power band. So figure your fuel consumption at something over 1200 rpm. OMC.
