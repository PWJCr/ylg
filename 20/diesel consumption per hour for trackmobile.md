## What is the hourly fuel consumption of a 250 cfm compressor  - Answers
250 euros into dollars is $305.74. This is because the ratio of euros to dollars currently is 1:1.22. So 250 multiply by 1.22 = to $305.74. This does vary hourly as the conversion will vary.

## Calculating Fuel Consumption | Boat GPH
This makes it important to know that ethanol free gasoline weighs about 6.2 pounds per gallon and diesel fuel about 6.9 pounds per gallon. On average, a four-stroke gasoline engine will burn about 0.50 pounds of fuel per hour per horsepower. Likewise, a well-maintained diesel engine burns about 0.40 pounds of fuel per hour per horsepower.

A litre of diesel is about 0.84 to 0.86 kilograms (1L=0.8-0.85KG). Most manufacturers of diesel air compressors use g/kw.h to measure the fuel consumption, which means how many grams (g) of oil are consumed in an hour for a generator set of a kilowatt (kw), and then change the unit into liters (L) so that you know the cost of fuel consumption per hour.

## Fuel Consumption - Kubota Tractors - Popular Compact Tractors
 165616. As a general rule of thumb, a modern diesel will use about 1/3 of a pound of fuel, per horsepower, per hour, at peak power. A gallon of Diesel fuel is 7.3 pounds. By that then a 44hp engine will use about 14.5 pounds per hour. That is roughly 2 gallons per hour.

## Fuel Consumption at Idle | The Diesel Stop
If they need to sit for long periods used as a PTO, they should be idled up to about 1250 rpms (min) or what the PTO requirement will be. A 6.4 will regen MUCH more frequently at idle than in it's power band. So figure your fuel consumption at something over 1200 rpm. OMC.
