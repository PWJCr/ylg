## What Causes Low Oil Pressure (& How To Fix It) - LubeZone
1. Oil Level Is Too Low. The oil level dropping below the minimum dipstick line is one of the most common causes of low oil pressure. This can happen at any time, even if you've recently had an oil change. Over time, engines burn oil more quickly. This is due to piston rings wearing, seals leaking, and so on.

## operating pressure of cooling oil in cone crushers
Crushing Plant Startup Sequence Procedure. The operator must pay close attention to the cone crusher lube system A low pressure alarm will sound if there is an abnormally low oil pressure If this alarm sounds, the crusher will shut down after a timed delay If the crusher is allowed to operate longer than 2 minutes after the loss of oil pressure, serious damage to the crusher may result

## Five steps to optimize crusher's lubrication system - Metso Outotec
Some of the things that could cause a lower-than-normal lube oil pressure are a low gallon-per-minute oil flow rate caused by a worn lube oil pump, a faulty, mis-set or stuck-open main relief valve, or having excessive bearing clearances within the crusher caused by bushing wear.
