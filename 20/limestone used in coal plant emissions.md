## What is clean coal technology? | HowStuffWorks
Carbon capture and storage-- perhaps the most promising clean coal technology -- catches and sequesters carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from stationary sources like power plants. Since CO2 contributes to global warming, reducing its release into the atmosphere has become a major international concern.In order to discover the most efficient and economical means of carbon capture, researchers
