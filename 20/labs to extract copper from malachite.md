##  Extracting a metal from its ore
Copper can be extracted from its ores by reduction. One of the common copper ores, malachite, which is composed of mainly copper carbonate, CuCO3xCu(OH)2, is heated to produce copper oxide with the release of carbon dioxide. CuCO3xCu(OH)2 → 2 CuO + CO2 + H2O The copper oxide is then heated with carbon to get copper. 2 CuO + C → 2 Cu + CO2

## Malachite Extract - Beauty and the Biome
Malachite Extract. Malachite extract is a liquid mineral extract derived from Malachite stone, a natural source of copper and other trace minerals. The use of pulverized malachite dates back to around 4000 BC, with many civilizations, including the Egyptians, Mayans, And Aztecs, all having used it for healing infections and wounds.

Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is
