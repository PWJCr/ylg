The sand casting process involves the use of a furnace, metal, pattern, and sand mold. The metal is melted in the furnace and then ladled and poured into the cavity of the sand mold, which is formed by the pattern. The sand mold separates along a parting line and the solidified casting can be removed.

## Permanent Mold Chill Casting Vs. Sand Casting - Which is Better?
What is Sand Casting? Sand casting is characterized by using sand as the mold material. A pattern is used, around which the sand is compacted. This forms a cavity in the form of the component to be cast. The sand used is a blend of silica grains with five to 20% clay or bentonite and two to eight percent water. Sand can be shaped by hand or by

Different kinds of sand are well-known in sand casting. Sand-casting molds come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Molds or casting materials come in six varieties. For the "lost wax" method of casting, ceramic molds are used. A wax model of the intended item is used to create a ceramic mold.

The Air Set casting process uses dry sand, rather than wet sand, and is bonded with materials other than clay. This method also uses an adhesive that is fast curing. Each method's accuracy depends on the type of sand and the molding process. An easy way to identify coarse green sand is that it causes a rough surface texture.

Green Sand. Green sand refers to the sand molds formed from wet sand and is sometimes referred to as clay. The sand mold is in an uncured state as the metal is being poured. Sand casting using green sand is quick and inexpensive since the sand can be reused. The downside is that the sand is a soft mold and can collapse or shift during casting

There are two basic types of sand used in the modern sand casting process. They are Green Sand and Dry Sand. Green Sand: This is a blend of sand and water, silica, pitch and potentially other ingredients to produce a moist compound to produce a desired mold. An advantage of green mold casting is that after castings are made, sand can be used

Control of all aspects of the properties of sand is crucial when manufacturing parts by sand casting, therefore a sand laboratory is usually attached to the foundry. Sand casting is a widely used method of producing rough metal castings.
