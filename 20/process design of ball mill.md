8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

Design and operating principle. A ball mill is a hollow drum rotating around its horizontal axis. It is filled with grinding balls (impact elements). As a result of rotation, balls on the internal drum surface lift and then fall down under the gravity action. The source material is permanently fed through one of spigots.

## What is Ball Milling Process? - ball mills supplier
The ball milling process is generally divided into two types, the dry ball milling process, and the wet ball milling process. This article takes dry ball milling as an example to introduce the ball milling process. First, select the appropriate size and weight of the grinding medium according to the particle size of the grinding material.

The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%
