## Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology By Electrostatic Separation
Almost 100% of mined iron ore is used in steel production, making it essential for everything from staples to buildings. Beneficiation is the term for reducing the size of valuable iron ore particles and separating them from the gange (unusable minerals), which are then discarded. There are several different methods of wet and dry separation.

Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

## A Trend ? A Necessity? Iron Ore Beneficiation - Blogger
Consequent to recent directive on threshold values, notified threshold value for iron ore exploration within prospecting licences and mining leaseholds is now 45 percent. Effectively it brings the matter down to one universal truth, "Iron Ore Beneficiation". Nevertheless, with technology just a thought away, its just a matter of time before "Beneficiation" is no longer a

## difference between iron ore beneficiation and iron ore concentration
The raw ore used by a concentrator in this study was supplied by its own open-pit mining site, which limits the selectivity of beneficiation to a certain extent. The nature of this raw ore is very complicated. The composition was mainly low-grade ore, hematite, carbonate iron ore, and silicate iron ore. Read More
