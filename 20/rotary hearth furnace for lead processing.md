## Rotary hearth furnace process for steel mill waste recycling and direct 
The Plant and Machinery Division of Nippon Steel Corporation has introduced the basic technologies of the rotary hearth furnace, DryIron TM Process, from Maumee Research & Engineering Inc. in the United States, and developed the process in order to recycle such dust and sludge effectively.

process, heat transfer occurs efficiently by radiation, with much less risk of reduction fragmentation. Thus, this process would be more advantageous than any conventional process using a rotary kiln or a shaft furnace. In the early 1960s, Midland Ross Corp., the predecessor of MIDREX Technologies, started developing a process called "HEATFAST,"
