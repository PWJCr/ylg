## concrete coal silo functioning procedure
Coal silos are used to store both mined earth and prepped coal. When miners cut up sections of a coal bed other materials in the soil get mixed up with the coal that is being mined from the bed. This combination of earth, coal, and other minerals is brought to the surface and stored in a building called a silo.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep

Slipform silos are best for construction projects over 65' in diameter or if multiple concrete silos need to be created at once. These concrete silos are formed from a continuous, monolithic pour of the concrete walls, necessitating a round-the-clock construction schedule. Jumpform silo construction projects range from 10' to 65' in diameter.
