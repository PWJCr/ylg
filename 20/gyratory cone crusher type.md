## Different types of crushing equipments - Constro Facilitator
Jaw crushers; Impact crusher; Gyratory crusher; Cone crusher. A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. The crushed material is discharged at the bottom of the machine after they pass through the cavity.

## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
Cone crusher looks like gyratory crusher but without a steep crushing chamber. Just like jaw crusher, it is also a compression type crusher whose reduction ratio is 4:1 to 6:1. When cone crusher works, it uses the force between moveable mantle and stationary bowl liner to crush material. As the material is getting smaller, it keeps moving down

## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl, but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1.  Compression-type crushers such as jaws and cones can clog due to packing (caking) of RAP when the RAP

## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
Cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, but with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks material by squeezing the material between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered
