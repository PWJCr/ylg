## Indonesia: Mining, Minerals and Fuel Resources
The key natural resources of the country include silver, coal, fertile soil, natural gas, petroleum, gold, bauxite, tin, copper, timber, and nickel. Indonesia is a globally leading exporter of tin and thermal coal. The mining industry in the country makes up 11.9% of its GDP. In 2010, foreign investment in the mining sector exceeded $2.2 billion.

## Coal Mountaintop Mining Di Indonesia
Mountaintop mining is the dominant form of coal mining and the largest driver of land cover change in the central Appalachians. The waste rock from these surface mines is disposed of in the adjacent river valleys, leading to a burial of headwater streams and dramatic increases in salinity and trace metal concentrations immediately downstream.

What is the mining process? Mining is the process used to extract valuable resources from the Earth. The Hopi Indians in the American Southwest started using the fuel in the early 1300s for baking pottery, cooking food, and heating homes. English settlers discovered coal in Eastern North America in 1673, but commercial coal mining did not begin

Starting in the 1960s coal seams in both Kentucky coal fields have been increasingly accessed via a method known as Mountaintop Removal Mining, which is a form of surface mining that involves the topographical alteration and/or removal of a summit, summit ridge, or significant portion of a mountain, hill, or ridge in order to obtain a desired geologic material.

The most prominent pattern of mining-induced deforestation in Indonesia is found in Kalimantan, where a specific synergy of impactful factors takes place. Extensive large-scale coal mining facilitates small-scale artisanal gold mining through proliferation of transport infrastructure with equally surface-degrading impacts.

A 2016 study by Duke University researchers published in the journal, Environmental Science and Technology, found that some 40 years of mountaintop coal mining have made parts of Central Appalachia 40% flatter than they were before excavation. The researchers found that the mines and valley fills could range anywhere from 10 to 200 meters deep. Across the region, the average slope of the land
