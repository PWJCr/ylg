5. DEFINITON: • A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and selective laser sintering etc. 6. PRINCIPLE: A ball mill works on the principle of impact and attrition. size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

A Ball mill is a horizontal cylinder partly filled with steel balls (or occasionally other shapes) that rotates on its axis, imparting a tumbling and cascading action to the balls. Material fed through the mill is crushed by impact and ground by attrition between the balls. The grinding media are usually made of high- chromium steel.
