The NEA plans 900 gigawatts (GW) of new installed non-fossil fuel power generation capacity in 2020, lowering the share of coal in the national energy mix to 57.5% from 57.7% in 2019, a small but noteworthy reduction. China will continue to replace coal-fired power plants with electricity-based heating to curb coal consumption, the NEA said.

Mar 5, 2022by Vallery - March 5, 2022. Power stations powered by coal run the majority of what are produced in China. Over 1,100 coal power plants operated on China's mainland by 2022. These topped 6,600 s plants on the Chinese mainland. This was nearly four times the number of such power stations in India, which ranked second.

Despite these updates to the numbers for coal generation and cement, my best estimate remains that China's CO2 emissions were cut by 25% reduction in the four weeks after Chinese New Year, equivalent to 200MtCO2. For the first seven weeks, during which demand slowly resumed, I estimate roughly an 18% reduction, amounting to 250MtCO2.
