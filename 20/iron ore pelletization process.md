## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process - IspatGuru
Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is

## The Iron Pelletizing Process: Part One :: Total Materia Article
The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub-processes, or process segments. On the way from the mine to a final product, the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed. About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length, width, or height).

Indian blast furnaces are fed with lump iron ore (10 - 40 mm) and sinter as burden. Sinter is a prepared burden, where iron ore fines of size -10 + 0.15 mm are agglomerated using mainly flux and coke. Iron ore fines of less than 0.15 mm are not utilized in sintering technology and hence are mostly discarded at mines during processing as slime.
