## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product

## USA - Copper smelting process - Google Patents
A copper smelting process is disclosed in which copper concentrate is smelted in a furnace to produce purified copper. Flue gas discharged from the furnace is treated to produce sulfuric acid. Furthermore, waste liquid discharged during the production of sulfuric acid is treated to produce gypsum, and the gypsum thus produced is recycled to the furnace as a flux.

## Was copper smelting invented in the paleolithic era?
Can you melt copper ore? Melting copper ore (compounds of copper and other stuff like oxygen, carbonates, sulfides, ..) produces a molten copper compound. Chalcocite, a copper sulfide (Cu 2 S) or cuprite, a copper oxide (Cu 2 O), for example, melts at 1130 °C ( 2066 °F) or 1232 °C (2250 °F), respectively. Why was bronze better than copper?

## Ore processing and metal extraction
Later, the copper was extracted from sulphide ores, as found in the veins, but still using charcoal. This was a costly process in fuel and was only efficient when the copper concentration was high. The first stage was to roast or calcine the ore to convert any sulphides to oxides. The ore was then smelted at a higher temperature with an excess

## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

Iron and sulfur are converted to oxides and are removed in either the gas stream or the slag (the latter being recycled for the recovery of remaining values), leaving a " blister" copper containing between 98.5 and 99.5 percent copper and up to 0.8 percent oxygen. The converter is rotated for skimming the slag and pouring the blister copper.

Sulfide Copper Ores . Virtually all sulfide-type copper ores, including chalcocite (Cu 2 S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS), are treated by smelting. After crushing the ore to a fine powder, it is concentrated by froth flotation, which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic.

How does the smelting process work? Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy to produce a metal from its ore. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind.The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, charcoal, and coal.

## By smelting iron ore we get?sewing
How are ores smelted? Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy to produce a metal from its ore. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, charcoal, and coal.

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Jan 25, 2022Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm. Copper ore crushing process. 1.
