While the engagement of Chinese migrants in small-scale mining in Ghana has gained traction in scholarship, the extant literature pays little attention to how the relationship between the so-called formal institutions (e.g., the Minerals Commission and Ministry of Land and Natural Resources) and informal institutions (e.g., the chieftaincy and customary land institutions) enables illegalities

## Resource politics and the impact of Chinese involvement in small-scale 
Since 2009, with the involvement of Chinese miners in gold mining, which peaked in 2013, small-scale mining in Ghana has become highly mechanized, involving the use of excavators, wash plants and other equipment. These, in comparison to manual 'traditional' methods, have increased small-scale gold production nearly seven-fold.

The role of the state in prioritizing large-scale over small-scale mining also comes into focus here. Much of the legislation on mining privileges large-scale mining, especially foreign companies, over local artisanal mining. The small-scale mining sector has faced decades of ﬁnancial and technological neglect by the state.

So massive is the foreign invasion that, in 2013, the South China Morning Post, for instance, estimated that the number of Chinese miners in Ghana, mainly from China's Shanglin Province, in the gold hunt, was about 50,000. Illegal foreign miners have a rather sneaky way of entering the small-scale industry.

The study reveals that weak policies regulating artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Ghana are also responsible for the increasing environmental problems. Due to this, non-Ghanaians, particularly, Chinese immigrants, have trooped themselves into illegal small-scale mining, hence, increasing the environmental impacts of ASM in the country.
