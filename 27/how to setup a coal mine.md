## About Coal Mine Methane | US EPA
CMM refers to the methane released from coal and the surrounding rock strata from mining activities. This methane in mines poses a safety risk due to its explosiveness when mixed with air. Methane is also a greenhouse gas that is more than 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a mass basis over a 100-year time period ( learn more about
