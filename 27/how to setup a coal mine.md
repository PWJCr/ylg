Nov 16, 2017 Â· In .15, boilers consume 3.6MW of coal (to produce 1.8MW of steam which can feed exactly two steam engines). Given that a unit of coal has 8MJ energy, a boiler at full capacity requires 3.6/8=.45 coal per second or 27 coal per minute. A mine still produces .525 coal per second or 31.5 per minute. So, a fuel yellow belt of coal:

This lignite field is part of the Great Plains coal area. Heat values of the deposits in this area range from 6,500 to 7,000 BTU/lb. The lignite is primarily burned by local power plants, but can be used by any properly designed stokers, coal-fired units and cyclone furnaces. Beulah Mine | Freedom Mine.

## About Coal Mine Methane | US EPA
CMM refers to the methane released from coal and the surrounding rock strata from mining activities. This methane in mines poses a safety risk due to its explosiveness when mixed with air. Methane is also a greenhouse gas that is more than 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a mass basis over a 100-year time period ( learn more about
