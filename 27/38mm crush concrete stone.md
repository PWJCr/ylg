## Compressive strength
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

## Crushed Concrete (recycled) - Earth Haulers, Inc.
Recycled. Crushed concrete is recycled and comes in graded and screened sizes for use as a Hard Fill or Drainage material. It packs well to give a firm base and can be used as an alternative to standard base materials. When graded and screened to fine, crushed concrete works well as leveling under footpaths or concrete driveways.
