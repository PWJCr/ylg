A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications. Fine liner configurations typically have reduction ratios of 4:1 to 6:1.

## Aggregate production: Fines generation during rock crushing
The energy required to crush rock material is proportional to the amount of new surface area that is created. Therefore, energy consumption increases with fines generation, and it can be estimated that 10 times more energy is spent in producing pond screenings than in producing 10SM sand, for the same weight.

## Crushing and Screening for Mineral Processing Success
When looking at overall crushing circuit design, having the correct number of crushing stages also helps minimize fines production. A typical crushing circuit will generate a reduction ration between 5:1 and 7:1 for maximum efficiency. For example, to generate a 10mm particle, you'll want to feed the crusher particles between 50 and 70mm.
