## Crushing Ratio Of Aggregate
As a guiding principle, a reduction ratio of 4 is generally considered as the maximum of any jaw or cone crusher. if the ratio of feed material and end product size is 161, you need 2 crushers, and this is calculated by multiplying 4 with 4. if the ratio would be, lets say 201, you would need 3 crushers.

## aggregate crushing ratio
A three-stage cycle with surface, mortar, and natural aggregate crushing is proposed. • A crushing load reduction ratio for natural aggregate crushing is proposed. • The stresses at the initial crack and peak state are 0.1-1.5 MPa and 0.2-3.0 MPa. Contact us
