Abstract A numerical model for the process of reduction and meltdown of iron ore-carbon pellets has been developed. The model covers the devolatilisation of coal, a set of gaseous reduction reactions by carbon monoxide and hydrogen and reactions for the formation of reducing gases. Carburisation of reduced iron and its subsequent meltdown is an important high temperature feature of the model.

## The carbon-based reduction method is not used for the  - Vedantu
Hint: In this method of carbon-based reduction the metal ore is decomposed by treating the ore with heat and a chemical reducing agent like a carbon source to extract the metal. The oxides which have a higher affinity for oxygen than carbon, cannot be reduced using carbon. Complete step by step answer:-First of all let us see what this process of carbon-based reduction method is.
