## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

Sep 20, 2021Cone crushers in secondary crushing applications are typically equipped with the 3.5:1 5-to-1 reduction ratio. Tertiary cone crushers generally operate with a reduced rate that ranges from 2.5:1 up to 4:4. This ratio has been the proportion of feed which 80 percent will be able to pass (F80) divided by the size of the product with which 80

## Comparison between Cone Crusher and Jaw Crusher - Virily
A Jaw crusher is used for the purpose of primary crushing. Thus the stones fed as input are of a large size. A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.
