There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.
