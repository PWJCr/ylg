## Can Dye Be Removed From the Limestone
Probably the best solution is to find a product that can be submerged in water that can be tinted to as close as possible to the limestone color.

The limestone is mostly made up of one of two types of mineral - calcite or aragonite. Both of these are different crystal arrangements of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). All limestones contain at least 50% calcium carbonate by weight. Limestones also contain a considerable amount of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), also known as dolomite.
