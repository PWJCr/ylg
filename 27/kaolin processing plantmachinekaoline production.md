## All Steps in Kaolin Production - Mining and Processing Explained
Aug 27, 2021Kaolin undergoes the dry processes of crushing, drying, pulverizing, and classifying to purify the deposits. Roll crushers will crush big chunks of raw kaolin to the preferred sizes. These crushed kaolins go to the rotary driers for further drying, pulverizing, and air floating procedures. The purpose is to eliminate coarse grits.

## Kaolin | Al2H4O9Si2 - PubChem
Kaolin or china clay is a mixture of different minerals. Its main component is kaolinite; in addition, it frequently contains quartz, mica, feldspar, illite, and montmorillonite. Kaolinite is made up of tiny sheets of triclinic crystals with pseudohexagonal morphology. It is formed by rock weathering.
