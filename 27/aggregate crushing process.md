## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.

The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

## Aggregate Processing Plant Design
Aggregate Processing Plant Design. Aggregate processing plants include feeding system, crushing sand system, screening system and sorting system. The selection of aggregate processing plant is an important part of modern aggregate production. Studies have shown that gravel aggregate has become the second largest consumable for human beings.

## Essentials of Process Design for Aggregate Crushing Plant
The key point of the process design of the aggregate production plant is to compare the selection of various crushing and screening equipment and the process route, and the comparison of the schemes runs through the whole project design and every detail.
