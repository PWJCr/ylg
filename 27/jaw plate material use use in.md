These non-choking jaw plates have been developed in two styles, reversible and non-reversible. The advantage of the reversible design has been outlined in connection with its application to the gyratory reduction crusher. For both types of jaw plate, the effective receiving opening is reduced, as compared to the standard, straight-plate setup.
