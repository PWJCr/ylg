## How is Stone Quarried - Global Granite and Marble
The process starts by taking down a "bench wall," a large dimensional chunk of rock that is then cut into smaller blocks which will eventually be sent to the factory for processing. The bench walls are cut using a combination of diamond wire cables, drills and even high temperature torches that will melt the stone.

## All You Need to Know About Limestone & How It Formed?
Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock containing 10% of all rocks. Limestone is chiefly containing calcium in various chemical formats including calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and known as Calcite in the geological term. However, common people hardly familiar with professional terminology so it is better to simplify it.

Jul 1, 2022Spotted: The current process for creating portland cement—one of the world's most common building materials—consists of heating limestone to high temperatures.Today, limestone for cement production is quarried. As a result, the heating process releases carbon that would otherwise be locked away in the earth into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.

## How Natural Stone Is Quarried - Great Lakes Granite & Marble
Limestone, gypsum, granite, marble, sandstone and slate are just a few of the many quarried materials. A great deal of work goes into determining quarry location and size where quality blocks can be extracted. Specialized drill bits are used to remove core samples. Those samples are then tested to ensure suitability.
