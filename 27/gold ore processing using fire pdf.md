##  Cyanide Amenability Studies of Gold Ores-The Use of Design of 
Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ores from which it is mined. Generally, to recover the gold requires separation of it from the associated minerals in the ore, which could be achieved by selectively dissolving the gold in a suitable lixiviant. Worldwide, majority of gold is extracted from it ores using cyanide as a lixiviant.

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product
