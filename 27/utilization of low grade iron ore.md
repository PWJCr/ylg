DRI-electric arc furnace (EAF) technology is proven and in use today. However, it requires high-quality iron ore (DR-grade) with iron (Fe) content of 67% and above, which has lower levels of impurities. DR-grade iron ore currently makes up only about 4% of global iron ore supply. Some fossil fuel-based steelmaking supply chain incumbents

Due to the depletion of high-grade iron ores and their simultaneous demand, the utilization of low-grade iron ores such as banded hematite quartzite (BHQ) has become a topic of research interest around the globe, particularly in India. These low-grade iron ores are reckoned to be the future feedstock for iron and steel making industries.

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
In some places reduction roasting of the low grade hematite ore is done to convert it into magnetic ore before the application of the magnetic separation method for the ore beneficiation. Another method which can be employed is the use of a dense medium in a gas-solid fluidized bed for the enrichment of iron ore.

## Sale-seigel
There are two ways to figure out the price of this metal. Most of the titanium ore (95% to be exact) is used to create titanium dioxide (TiO 2), which is a white pigment used as an additive or coating.So, one way of determining the price of the metal is to check out how much TiO 2 costs. For 2016, Chemours, the largest TiO 2 producer in the world.
