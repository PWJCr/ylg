## Crushed Concrete (recycled) - Earth Haulers, Inc.
Crushed concrete is recycled and comes in graded and screened sizes for use as a Hard Fill or Drainage material. It packs well to give a firm base and can be used as an alternative to standard base materials. When graded and screened to fine, crushed concrete works well as leveling under footpaths or concrete driveways.

Crusher run gravel (also known as "crush and run") is an aggregate made of fine gravel with larger pieces of limestone. This combination is similar to crushed concrete as it also compacts well and drains well. You can use crusher run for driveways, under concrete slabs, for walkways, and in other areas.

## Can Concrete Be Recycled | How To Recycle Concrete
Recycling concrete reduces building waste, extends landfill life, and saves builders' disposal or tipping fees. It also saves money on transportation because concrete can typically be recycled near the demolition or building site. If a builder is pursuing LEED Green Building certification, using recycled concrete might earn them points.
