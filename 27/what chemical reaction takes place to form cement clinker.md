## Function of admixture in concreteotherapie-cordes
The percentage of admixture used in concrete varies depending on the type of admixture and the content of the cement . Typically the dosage is indicated by the manufacturer and is based on the cement content. Generally speaking, admixtures make up a fairly small percentage of the concrete mix, with values of 5 percent or less being common..

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

## Reactions in the cement kiln - clinkering - Understanding Cement
Alite formation and other reactions at 1300 °C - 1450 °C in the burning zone. In the burning zone, above about 1300 °C, reactions take place quickly. The clinker is in the burning zone for perhaps 10-20 minutes but in this time a lot happens: The proportion of clinker liquid increases and nodules form.

## Chemical Reactions In Cement Kilns
The kiln is the most important component of a cement manufacturing plant as most of the chemical reactions take place in it at high temperature. Rotary kilns are used which consist of a huge rotating steel furnace with a length and diameter ratio between 10 and 40 37 .  Thermodynamics Of Clinker Formation Cement Plants And. The Rotary Kiln

## CEMENT CHEMISTRY AND CLINKER MICROSCOPY - The Cement Institute
Overview. A 4-week modular course designed to give the course attendee a solid understanding of the cement chemistry and clinker microscopy. Cement microscopy is a valuable technique for examining clinker, cement, raw materials, raw feed, and coal. Every stage of the cement manufacturing process can be improved through the use of a microscope.
