## Classification of Aggregate Based on Size and Shape
The origin of aggregates is mainly from the rocks that can be igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. It has a significant role in the performance of concrete because it gives volume to the concrete. Almost 70-80% portion of concrete is composed of aggregates. The workability of concrete is highly dependent on the type of aggregate.
