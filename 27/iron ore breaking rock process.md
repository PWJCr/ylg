3. Iron phosphate coating - the most economical. Steel, zinc and aluminium are all suitable substrates for iron phosphate coating. This is the most flexible option when it comes to the type of substrate. It is also the most economical: the iron phosphating price is clearly lower than the costs of zinc and manganese phosphating services.

## When smelting iron ore? Explained by FAQ Blog
What is the process of smelting iron ore? Smelting involves heating up ore until the metal becomes spongy and the chemical compounds in the ore begin to break down.  Carbon and carbon monoxide combine with the oxygen in the iron ore and carry it away, leaving iron metal. In a bloomery, the fire doesn't get hot enough to melt the iron completely.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
