## Dolomite: Identification, Pictures & Info for Rockhounds
Dolomite, or dolostone, is a carbonate sedimentary rock made mostly from the mineral dolomite, CaMg (CO3)2. It commonly occurs in association with limestone and shares many of the same properties, but reacts only weakly with acid. Dolomite often has a sugary texture and is typically off-white to gray in color.

## Dolomite Countertop Pros and Cons - Countertop Advisor
Dolomite is a harder-than-average material and is not as fragile as marble. On the Mohs hardness scale, dolomite rates at 3.5 - 4, superior to marble's Mohs rating. A higher hardness rating makes it a durable and strong countertop over time, capable of supporting various uses while being resistant to wear and tear.
