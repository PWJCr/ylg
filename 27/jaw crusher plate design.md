## Toggle Plate | Genuine Alternative Jaw Crusher Parts | GTEK
Toggle Plate is a simple & low-cost but very important part of jaw crusher. It is usually made of cast iron, and it is used to hold the lower part of the jaw in position, it also serves as a safety mechanism for the entire jaw. If something that the jaw crusher cannot crush gets into the crushing chamber accidentally and it cannot pass through

## Jaw Crusher Liner Plate Design & Profile Shapes
These non-choking jaw plates have been developed in two styles, reversible and non-reversible. The advantage of the reversible design has been outlined in connection with its application to the gyratory reduction crusher. For both types of jaw plate, the effective receiving opening is reduced, as compared to the standard, straight-plate setup.

Jaw crusher movement is guided by pivoting one end of the swinging jaw. and an eccentric motion located at the opposite end. [4] The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws .For instance, a 22 x 30 jaw crusher has an opening of 22" by 30", a 46 x 46 jaw crusher has a opening of 46" square.
