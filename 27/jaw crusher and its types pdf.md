##  Jaw Crushers
Jaw Crushers MJ 90, MJ 110 and MJ 130 Technical Specification Jaw Crushers reduce large size rocks or ore by placing the rock into compression. This mechanical pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while the other reciprocates. There are also primary and secondary types of jaw crushers.

In the Dodge type jaw crushers the jaw is pivoted at the bottom, giving a variable feed area but fixed discharge area.
