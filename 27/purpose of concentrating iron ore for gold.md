The bands of iron ore are at times high-grade, but are often mixed with a good deal of silica, the whole making an ore too lean for use without concentration. Iron formation is believed to be of sedimentary origin. In Ontario three epochs of deposition are known: (a) Keewatin-Grenville, as in the Michipicoten and Moose Mountain areas:

It's a long process which begins with Concentration through calcination roasting. Concentration removes the water and other volatile impurities such as sulphur and carbonates. This concentrated ore is mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
