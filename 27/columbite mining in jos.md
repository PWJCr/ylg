In Jos, Plateau State, Tin and allied metals mining started about 1902. Within this span of time the tin fields have been subjected to a process of unregulated mining activity, thereby devastate and depleted agricultural lands by intensive and extensive mechanized mining activities [4].

## Mining industry of Nigeria
Mining is the extraction or removal of minerals and metals from the earth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining, processing, and sales of coal, lignite, and coke products until 1999.. Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu. It was found by Albert Kitson, a British mine engineer.
