Proper conditioning limits seed degradation. The nursery manager must have facilities readied for seed preparation at the time of collection. Such facilities should be located at the nursery site, thus eliminating the need for further transport before sowing. Seed extraction should occur as the fruits arrive from the field.

Sugar beets are not only a great crop for sugar production, but are also a fantastic dual-purpose food plot plant. Deer enjoy the leafy tops for forage and will also dig up the sugary roots to eat in late fall and throughout the winter months. Sugar beets will reach a mature weight of 2-4 lbs. each and provide a solid food source for deer. Cooler weather promotes increased sugar content and

## How sugar is made - manufacture, used, processing, parts, components 
Sugar synthesized in the leaves is used as a source of energy for growth or is sent to the stalks for storage. It is the sweet sap in the stalks that is the source of sugar as we know it. The reed accumulates sugar to about 15 percent of its weight. Sugarcane yields about 2,600,000 tons of sugar per year.
