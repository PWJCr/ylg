## Types of Concrete Blocks or Concrete Masonry Units in Construction
The common size of concrete blocks is 39cm x 19cm x (30cm or 20 cm or 10cm) or 2 inch, 4 inch, 6 inch, 8 inch, 10 inch and 12-inch unit configurations. Cement, aggregate, water is used to prepare concrete blocks. The cement-aggregate ratio in concrete blocks is 1:6. Aggregate used is of 60% fine aggregate and 40% coarse aggregate.

Of course cutting all the tree roots will in fact kill the tree. A general rule for cutting tree roots is don't cut more than 25% of the root system. Measure the trunk diameter at about 4 feet from the ground. Take that measurement and multiply it by 6. Mark off that distance from the trunk and that is about where 25% of the roots can be cut. 15 Amp 14 in. Portable Concrete Saw. $27999.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS. Cement concrete is a mixture of Portland cement, aggregates (sand and stone chips) and water. Aggregates passing through 4.7 mm IS sieve are known as fine aggregates and the aggregates retained on this sieve are coarse aggregates. The process of manufacture of cement concrete paving blocks involves the following steps:

## Autoclaved Aerated Concrete - Cement
Autoclaved Aerated Concrete. Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is made with fine aggregates, cement, and an expansion agent that causes the fresh mixture to rise like bread dough. In fact, this type of concrete contains 80 percent air. In the factory where it is made, the material is molded and cut into precisely dimensioned units.
