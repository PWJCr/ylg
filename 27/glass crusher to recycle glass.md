Glass recycling has several benefits: A ton of recycled glass saves over a ton of natural resources. For every 10% of used cullet, energy cost goes down 2 to 3 %. 6 tons of recycled glass reduce a ton of carbon dioxide used in the manufacturing process. Cullet melts at a lower temperature, so it uses less energy.
