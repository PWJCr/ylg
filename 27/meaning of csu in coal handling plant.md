## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin

##  Quality Assured Maintenance Management For Coal Handling Plant
Maintenance of coal handling plants (CHP) of thermal power stations has traditionally as the processes related to the performance of routine, unscheduled and emergency maintenance. It doesn't include operational factors such as scheduling, procedures, and work/systems control. The failures of equipments have led to high maintenance and

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.
