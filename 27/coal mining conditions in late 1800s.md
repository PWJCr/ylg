Coal camp living conditions were often squalid, with social life dominated by the company and basic freedoms of speech, movement, and assembly restricted by private mine guards and company-paid sheriffs. Mining coal was incredibly dangerous work. During the industrial coal boom between 1880 and 1923, more than 70,000 miners died on the job.

Coal mining at Rock Springs, 140 miles west of Carbon, also began in the late 1860s to supply coal to the U.P.

Industrial work during the nineteenth century was often hazardous. Nowhere was this situation more true that in coal mining. By the 1860s some anthracite coal mines in northeastern Pennsylvania had reached as much as 1,500 feet into the earth. Miners reached these depths with technologies that, by later standards, would seem primitive.
