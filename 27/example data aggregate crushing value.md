The average crushing value in the different tests is the actual crushing value of aggregate. Important points to remember. It is recommended that the crushing value of aggregate should be less than 30%. If it is more than 30 % then 10% finer aggregate is suggested to use. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 30% can be used for . Get

##  Methods for determination of aggregate crushing value (ACV) (BS 
the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 mm test sieve. For other size fractions, there is another recommended method.
