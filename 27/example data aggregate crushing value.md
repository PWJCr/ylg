##  Methods for determination of aggregate crushing value (ACV) (BS 
the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 mm test sieve. For other size fractions, there is another recommended method.
