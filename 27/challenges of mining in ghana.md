## Causes and Effects of Coastal Sand Mining in Ghana
Its contribution to Ghana's industrial output has increased from 17.4 per cent in 1986 to 20.8 per cent in 1993. However, the process of sand mining has accelerated coastal environmental degradation to an alarming rate in many areas. As a result the government has been compelled to spend millions of dollars to combat sea erosion.

ABSTRACT Illegal mining appears to be one of world's major mining problems and to a large extent Ghana's greatest environmental hazard. However, small scale and large-scale mining are not excluded from this problem because current statistics point to mining industries consuming almost 20% of the world's water supplies, also when a mine closure is done haphazardly, the area becomes an

## Coastal zone management challenges in Ghana: issues associated with 
Coastal erosion is a serious environmental problem that has caused the loss of private infrastructure and national assets along Ghana's coast. Several hard engineering measures have thus been used to protect some communities and vital state assets when they became threatened. Regardless of this problem, sediment mining activities are increasingly practiced along most of Ghana's coast

The traditional occupational hazards such as coal dust inhalation, damage to hearing due to the noise in a mine and chemical hazards still stand but the changing nature of mining has led to a raft of new issues. As mines are getting deeper, the risk of collapse has greatly increased.
