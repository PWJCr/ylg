## Raw materials - Sinter plant | ArcelorMittal
The sinter plant turns iron ore into sinter, which is the optimal product for the blast furnace. Sinter is made by burning a mix of iron ore powder, fluxes and recycled substances from the steel plant to create an open-grained, consistent substance. The sinter is then crushed, cooled and screened for dust. Sometimes, iron ore is supplied in the form of iron ore pellets.
