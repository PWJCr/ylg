Introduction. Gold Ore is an ore for New Players that only have Basic Pickaxe at the beginning. Gold Ore can be mined from Raw Gold () & Big Raw Gold () at the depth of +1300m (Gold Layer) until 8000m (before Gemstone Layer) in Ancient Mine. Mining Raw Gold will give 1 - 2 Gold Ore (s), while mining Big Raw Gold will give 15 - 20 Gold Ores.
