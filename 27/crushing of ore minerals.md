##  11.24 Metallic Minerals Processing
At most metallic mineral processing plants, each process operation requires several types of equipment. A single crushing operation likely includes a hopper or ore dump, screen(s), crusher, surge bin, apron feeder, and conveyor belt transfer points. Emissions from these various pieces of equipment are often ducted to a single control device.

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

How Are Minerals Mined? The rock is drilled and blasted then moved to the surface by truck belt conveyor or elevator. Once at the surface the material is sent to a mill to separate the ore from the waste rock. . In a surface mine hard rock must be drilled and blasted although some minerals are soft enough to mine without blasting.
