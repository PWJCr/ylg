## the work principle of gyratory crusher
Working Principle of Crushers. Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers.

## Difference Between Jaw Crusher and Gyratory Crusher - JXSC
Both jaw crusher and gyratory crusher can be used as primary crusher. Jaw crushers are more widely used, probably because of their price. Except for the price difference, there are others different in the two types of crushers. Such as working principle, structure, applications, capacity, input/output particle size, etc.
