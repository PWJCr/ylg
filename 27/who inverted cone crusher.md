## The History of Jaw Crushers and Cone Crushers
The first cone crusher was developed by the Symons brothers to improve secondary and tertiary crushing applications. While jaw crushers provide excellent primary crushing duties, new ways of crushing needed to be devised for finer and more consistently sized aggregates. In 1920, the Symons brothers created the first cone crusher.
