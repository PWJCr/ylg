## Overland Belt Conveyor System Design For Bulk Material Handling
The overland belt conveyor system is mainly used in bulk material handling industry. You can use it to transfer large quantity of bulk material in a certain hours. Our customers adopt it to convey iron ore, copper ore, limestone, granite, basalt, bauxite, phosphate rock, etc. In port, it is often combined with ship loader.

## Belt conveyor frame types and design considerations
The Belt conveyor frame is a metal structure (usually using normal and stainless steel conveyor frame) used to support idlers, pulley and belt tension. The designed structure and production material of the frame determine the quality of the frame. The actual use of the belt conveyor frames involve various forms of steel structure.

Drive arrangement: In belt conveyors the driving power is transmitted to the belt by the driving pulley which is rotated by an electric motor. The basic mechanism of transmission of power from the pulley to the belt is based on the theory of friction drive..

Pipe Conveyor Design. In pipe conveyors, the belt is rolled into a tube. These conveyors can negotiate tight curves and keep the material isolated from the environment. Our engineers invented a special carcass construction that is used by leading belt manufacturers to ensure the pipe is stable in horizontal curves (US Patent USB2).

## Belt Conveyor Safety Best Practices & Root Causes - Martin Eng
Best Practices: Conveyor guarding should weigh 50 pounds or less. Guarding should have no sharp edges and should stand out in color from equipment it is guarding. To increase safety, guarding should require a tool to remove. Emergency stop switches need to be tested every 30 days and not span more than 70 feet between switches.

Bucket conveyors are used in applications such as parts, bulk material, or food processing and handling. The conveyed material can be in liquid form or dry such as sludge, sand, manure, sugar, and grain. The systems can be used horizontally or can be inclined or vertical to change levels of the delivered products.

A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material. When motors in the pulleys operate at the same speed and spin in the same direction, the belt moves between the two.

Experts, What standard do your companies use in the design of the structures that support belt conveyors? The structural verification itself isn't really an issue. The loads and load combinations, however, can create some interesting discussions.
