It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.

To make concrete though which will greatly extend the volume produced you mix in gravel or sand or crushed brick. Proportions are an endless subject of debate but the formula of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts gravel by volume is a good starting point.

river or dune sand • Coarse sand with the biggest particles approximately 5 mm in size: crusher, pit or coarse river sand • Stone with a maximum size of 13 mm for bricks or solid blocks or 10 mm for hollow blocks It is normally possible to make blocks with coarse sand on its own. Alternatively combinations of aggregates may be used:

Yeah, you need sand to set the pavers. Sand is easier to level and makes a more solid base than gravel. You don't need a 2" layer on top of the gravel, but you need enough to make the base level. When planning a #57 Washed River Gravel  concrete, or gravel patio. 7 Free Calculators: - Concrete slab - Pavers - Paver Base - Polymeric Sand

To make concrete, four basic materials you need: Cement, sand, aggregate, water, and add-mixture. This concrete mix ratio of aggregate to sand to cement is an important factor in. of the pool shell concrete is a direct result of the velocity (typically 65 to 115 ft/s [20 to 35 m/s]5) at which the mixture is shotcreted onto the substrate.

## Can you sand concrete with sandpaper?
The short answer is yes, but the long answer is that sandpaper is not ideal for the job. Concrete is a very hard material, and sandpaper is not designed to sand hard materials. The grit on sandpaper is not as coarse as the aggregate in concrete, so it will not remove the material as effectively.

## Types of Sand used for Construction & Building Material - Rodidust
Buy the sand from Rodidust, the River sand supplier Gurgaon. Crushed Concrete sand (Crusher dust or Badarpur) The name itself shows how essential it will be in the construction activities. That said, the crushed concrete particles make it favourable for concrete work. The concrete sand is good for providing strength and stability to the building.
