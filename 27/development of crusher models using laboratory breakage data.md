The predictive model, built using data from lab tests, was easy to use and had high accuracy. In future studies, we aim to use data that reflect different types of stroke and to explore the data to build a prediction model for each type.

## What is a Data Model? | Center for Data, Analytics and Reporting
A data model organizes data elements and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another. Since data elements document real life people, places and things and the events between them, the data model represents reality. For example a house has many windows or a cat has two eyes. Data models are often used as an aid to communication

When simulating particulate systems using the discrete element method (DEM), particle breakage can occur. Sometimes the extent of this breakage is significant, such as in crushers and mills, which are designed to crush chunks of ore into smaller pieces.. Breakage is insignificant in cases when particles are subjected to handling, mixing, compaction and separation operations, where breakage is

Introduced in 1906, McLanahan's Universal Jaw Crusher was one of the first overhead eccentric jaw crushers. Since that time, this robust design has continued to be the basis of the Universal Jaw Crusher design. In addition to the standard jaw crusher design, McLanahan also produces the H-Series, which features adjust-on-the-fly capabilities.
