## Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials
As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft. Note, kg/cu.m divided by 16.02 = lbs/cu.ft.
