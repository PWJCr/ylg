## Collections: Iron, How Did They Make It? Part I, Mining
As for the ratio of iron-ore to finished iron, as far as we can tell, ancient iron-working was a lot less efficient than modern iron-working. From raw ore to finished goods, the estimates range from 8-16% of the mass of the ore ends up in the finished product. Not quite enough to explain the discrepancy, but still a big gap from modern figures.
