## Impact Crusher | Description | Advantages - Engineering Intro
The word impact makes sense that in this particular type of crusher some impaction is being used for crushing of rocks. In normal types of crusher pressure is generated for the crushing of rocks. But, impact crushers involve an impact method. There is a hopper one side that takes the crushing material into the machine.

## Impact crushers for aggregates and recycling | Foreman Equipment
A VSI relies on the velocity of material inside the crusher and impact to reduce the size of the material. Rock is fed into an accelerator at the centre of the crusher that uses centrifugal force to sling the material against an outer ring, lined with anvils. The size of the crushed rock is determined by the speed of the rotor.
