Their equipment and safety record was very good. They crushed over 400,000 tonne of limestone rock within a 12 week period. They supplied a range of 50-70 tonne Volvo excavators and rock breakers for extracting rock to be placed through their crushing equipment. We would have no hesitation in recommending this company for similar works.
