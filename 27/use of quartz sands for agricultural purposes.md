## Quartz sand - Gaofu
Quartz sand is a non-metallic mineral. It is a hard, wear-resistant and chemically stable silicate mineral. Take quartz stone plate as an example: it has the characteristics of no scraping, no pollution, no use. Quartz sand is widely used in glass, abrasives, casting, filter materials, construction, sheet, fireproof materials, etc.

Followings are the common sand uses. We can use sand to filter water; it works like an abrasive. We can use sand to give a grip to our painting or wall art by combining 2 cups of paint with a Â¾ cup of sand. People make sandpaper by gluing sand to a paper. While bunging metal, we can mix sand with clay binder for frameworks used in the foundries.
