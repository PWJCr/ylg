Followings are the common sand uses. We can use sand to filter water; it works like an abrasive. We can use sand to give a grip to our painting or wall art by combining 2 cups of paint with a ¾ cup of sand. People make sandpaper by gluing sand to a paper. While bunging metal, we can mix sand with clay binder for frameworks used in the foundries.
