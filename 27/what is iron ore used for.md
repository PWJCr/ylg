## Iron Ore Processing - Prominer (Shanghai) Mining Technology Co.,Ltd.
Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Pig iron
Pig iron. Pig iron of a type used to make ductile iron, stored in a bin. Pig iron, also known as crude iron, is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8-4.7%, [1] along with silica and other

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
