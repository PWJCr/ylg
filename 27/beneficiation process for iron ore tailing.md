## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm. Copper ore crushing process. 1.

## Beneficiation of Iron, Iron Extraction Process, Iron Ore Extraction
Xinhai Iron Ore Beneficiation Process.  process of magnetic concentrate on the basis of the single magnetic separation process. Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing, tailings were discarded with three scavenging, middlings returned to efficient thickener. Finally, iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%.

## Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation | ST Equipment & Technology
Dry processing of iron ore presents an opportunity to eliminate costs and wet tailings generation associated with flotation and wet magnetic separation circuits. STET has evaluated several iron ore tailings and run of mine ore samples at bench scale (pre-feasibility scale). Significant movement of iron and silicates was observed, with examples

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.
