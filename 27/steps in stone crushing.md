This promotes stone-on-stone crushing, which breaks up flaky or slabbier particles. If you are seeking fewer fines, trickle-feeding material into the jaw crusher could achieve this; however, this would have an adverse effect on particle shape and would also reduce throughput capacity, hindering the crusher's efficiency.
