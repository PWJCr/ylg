## 8 Mining Tax Pros And Cons
The Pros of a Mining Tax. 1. It levels the playing field. The fact is that most countries only have a few companies running the mining operations. There is such a lack of competition, in fact, that there are localized monopolies on the mining industry. When this occurs, the mining company has the ability to set their own pricing schedules for
