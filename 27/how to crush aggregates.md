## Crushed Aggregate - LaPrairie Group
Our aggregates products include: Crusher Chip. Crusher chip is a crushed aggregate, also known as rock aggregate, produced by crushing larger stones in an impact crusher. This type of crushed aggregate has a finer texture than that produced by other types of crushers. The stone aggregate is first broken up in a hammer mill or quarry crusher.

The answer is yes. A good sealer is being used to suppress the reaction (presuming one haven't used too much of water in the mix) or met kaolin can be used to suppress the reaction or contractor can grind the glass finely to pass smaller screens. Of course, keeping out moisture with a good sealer will also suppress the reaction.

Crushed gravel driveways are commonly composed of sand, silt, clay and larger aggregates (pebbles and small stones). Stone driveways, by contrast, are often more elegant. The source of the confusion over terminology is that the small stone used in stone driveways is sometimes also referred to as "gravel."
