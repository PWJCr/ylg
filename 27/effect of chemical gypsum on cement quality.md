## What are the Roles of Gypsum in Cement Production
The effects of gypsum on cement are analyzed from the following two aspects: flash setting and false setting. The functions of gypsum in cement The main chemical component of Gypsum is calcium sulfate, whose main chemical components are 32,5% CaO, 46.6% SO 3, 20.9% H 2 O+, and the components don't change much.

## Gypsum Is Essential and Necessary to Cement | Fote Machinery
Oct 28, 2021It takes a long time for the cement to hydrate and harden and needs enough water to ensure hydration. For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.

This makes the gypsum more effective in controlling and retarding aluminate phase hydration, thereby enhancing the strength of cement [ 21 ]. Partial dehydration of gypsum is also desirable as its crystal water can cause cement particles to adhere during cement storage or form lumps.

## Gypsum in Cement - ScienceDirect
Cements with high slag content, 65%, at early ages give evidence of a maximum in the course of strengths for slightly high gypsum content - about 4% - whereas at long ages there is a minimum in the course of strengths, for a gypsum content of about 5%. Above and below this value, strengths appreciably increase.

Gypsum plays a very important role in cement. The percentage of gypsum in terms of SO 3 is 2.5-3.0, but its role in cement is significant. At the early age of hydration, gypsum keeps cement in a plastic state which fosters workability. Gypsum retards the hydration reaction of calcium aluminate by changing the course of the reaction.
