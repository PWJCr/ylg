## Lost Treasures of the Upper Peninsula - The Ropes Gold Mine 
The Ropes Mine did not remain idle for long. In 1900 Corrigan McKinney and Co. bought the mine and recovered gold worth about $200,000 between 1900 and 1901 from the tailings left by earlier mining at the site. Additional gold was later recovered from the mercury amalgam which was still present in the mine from the old Ropes operations.
