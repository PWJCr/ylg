## Halliburton Awarded License for Gravel Pack Completions
October 8, 2019. (Photo: Halliburton) Oilfield services company Halliburton said it has been awarded an international license for ExxonMobil's patented Non-Aqueous Fluid Gravel Packing (NAFPac) technique for gravel pack completions. Hole stability and shale inhibition are keys to successful installation of openhole completions.

Prepacking methods are claimed by other operators to be very effective at packing perforations, controlling fluid loss and to result in high well productivity. Gravel can be squeezed into the perforations prior to running the gravel pack liner assembly. This method is to some extent a revival of the old "washdown" gravel packing technique.

Gravel placement techniques. Gravel packing consists of installing a downhole filter in the well to control the entry of formation material but allow the production of reservoir fluids. The gravel-packed completion is perhaps the most difficult and complex routine completion operation because it consists of many interrelated completion practices.

## Gravel Pack - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
High-density packing is adopted with a gravel-carrying volume ratio up to 96% (12 lb/gal), that is, 1 m 3 fluid should pack 0.96 m 3 gravel. The other is low-viscosity salt water with a gravel-carrying volume ratio of 8-15% (1-2 lb/gal), which can avoid the possible formation damage induced by the high-viscosity, gravel-carrying fluid.

A gravel pack will influence a zone within 100 to 250 feet of the pack, while fracking affects an area up to 5000 feet. At the Inglewood Oil Field, estimates were that frac packs and other gravel packing operations would be used on as many as 90 percent of all new wells, due to the permeable sandstone geology of the area.

Summary. This paper describes a technique for horizontal gravel packing of slim, cased holes. The key to the technique is the use of horizontally oriented perforations as a means of providing self-diversion of the gravel pack regardless of fluid leakoff. Traditional horizontal gravel packing requires minimizing fluid leakoff to the formation; otherwise, premature bridging can occur during the

## Installation of Well Screens and Gravel Packs
The gravel pack acts as a well screen in this example. First, drill the hole to the depth you are going to, typically 25 to 35 feet.

## Gravel packing horizontal and high-angle wells
Gravel packing is a widely applied technique for the control of sand. The increasing application of directional drilling both on and offshore has led to a number of completion difficulties. Gravel packing in deviated wells has for a long time caused considerable difficulties especially at hole angles above 40/sup 0/. This paper discusses the
