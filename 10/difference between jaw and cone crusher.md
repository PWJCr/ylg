## The difference between the Cone Crusher and the Fine Jaw Crusher 
In terms of processing capacity, cone crusher is much higher than fine jaw fracture, generally up to 1000t/h, which is double times than fine jaw crusher. In the treatment of hard materials, the compressive strength of the two is basically the same, between MPa.

## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The post-primary crushing sector is largely divided into impact crushers for the processing of softer stone and cone crushers for the processing of harder, more abrasive stone. The advantages of both machines are well known. The impact crusher, for example, has a higher co-efficient of reduction, produces crushed material with an optimal cubic

## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
Oct 23, 2020A Jaw crusher is made use of for the function of primary squashing. Hence the rocks fed as input are of plus size. It is able to squash material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is utilized for second crushing. The input to the cone crusher is a lot smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.

## Comparison between Cone Crusher and Jaw Crusher - Virily
A Jaw crusher is used for the purpose of primary crushing. Thus the stones fed as input are of a large size. A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.

## Jaw Crusher VS Cone Crusher | Which Is The Better Crusher
The gyratory body of cone crusher is higher, twice or three times of jaw crusher, and the workshop cost is larger. The weight of cone crusher is larger than that of jaw crusher with the same output by 1-2 times, so the equipment cost is higher. The installation and maintenance of cone crusher is more complicated than jaw crusher.

## The Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher
The jaw crusher has the widest range of adaptability and can meet the crushing requirements of almost any kind of material. The cone crusher also has wide applicability, but the Metso cone crusher is expensive. Low-cost impact crushers are available for low corrosive materials. As a result, the Metso cone crusher has reduced economic applicability.

## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

What is the difference between jaw crusher and cone crusher? The jaw crusher requires that the ore feeding must be even and not full, the materials in the jaw crusher chamber shall not exceed 2/3 of the crushing chamber height. The cone crusher can feed the ore with full load. It can be directly fed materials without vibration feeder.

Rose and English [9] determined the capacity of a jaw crusher by considering the time taken and the distance travelled by the particles between the two plates after being subjected to repeat crushing forces between the jaws. Therefore, dry particles wedged between level A and level B (Figure 4.4) would leave the crusher at the next reverse movement of the jaw.
