The specimens were taken from the limestone roof (K 2 layer) of 15,101 working face in a coal mine in Gaoping City, Shanxi Province, China, belonging to hard rock. The density is 2.72 g/cm 3 and the moisture content is 0.49 %. The roof layer is stable and thick (8.05 m), resulting in serious hanging roof at the end of the working face during mining.

After blasting, the fragmented material is loaded and transported to the grinding and sorting plant. The limestone obtained can be used in the aggregate industry or for cement and lime, depending on the quality of the material and the purpose of the mining operation. This quality will determine the processes necessary to achieve the final product.
