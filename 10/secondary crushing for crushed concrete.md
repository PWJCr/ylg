## Concrete aggregates properties crushed by jaw and impact secondary crushing
A two-crushing process can be found in European recycling plants, while the choice of a secondary crusher often relies on qualitative criteria such as coarse and fine RCA recovery fractions. However, a body of mineral processing literature supports the concept that comminution type might change the properties of the products attained.
