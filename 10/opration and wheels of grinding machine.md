Grinding Wheel Diameter = 24″, Machine Speed = 600 RPM; SFPM = 3772.8. As the wheel wears to, say, 21″, SFPM will slow to 3144 if RPM stays at 600. To maintain 3772.8 SFPM the RPM will need to be increased to 720. Now, you can get these calculations using pen and paper (or your trusty calculator) but we've made it easy for you but
