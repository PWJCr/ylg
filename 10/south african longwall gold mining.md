In 1975, South Africa was responsible for producing 40% of the gold ever mined. By 2010, however, China affirmed its status as the world's largest gold producer with production of 324 tonnes of gold, followed by Australia (222.8 tonnes), and South Africa with 219.8 tonnes. Today, South Africa produces only 4.2% of the world's gold.

The deep gold mines of South Africa are world-famous and more than 50 000 t of gold have been extracted from these mines since 1886 (Malan, 2021). Owing to the great depths of the workings, these mines are seismically active and rockbursts and falls of ground were the cause of many fatalities during the early years of mining.
