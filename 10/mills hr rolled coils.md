## Hot-rolled sheet steel: buy from the manufacturer - Metinvest
Steel sheets. Hot-rolled steel sheets. Hot-rolled steel plates are a type of flat rolled metal obtained by transverse cutting of hot-rolled coils after rolling them on semi-continuous or continuous mills. Similar to rolled products, steel plates are used in construction, engineering, the automotive industry and to make consumer goods.

## Difference Between Hot Rolled Steel and Cold Rolled Steel
Hot Rolled Steel. Hot rolling is a mill process which involves rolling the steel at a high temperature (typically at a temperature over 1700° F), which is above the steel's recrystallization temperature.  The term Cold Rolled is mistakenly used on all products, when actually the product name refers to the rolling of flat rolled sheet and
