## Mining
Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe.The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron.Other precious metals were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through open-pit mining, and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts.
