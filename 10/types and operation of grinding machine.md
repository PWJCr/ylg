Instead, centerless grinders are used for grinding very long pieces. The piece is hold by a dedicated support, while it will be subject to the simultaneous work of two wheels positioned on oblique axes to each other. Thanks to the different positioning of the two axes, the progress of the bar will be generated during processing.
