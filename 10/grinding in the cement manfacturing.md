## Cement Manufacturing Process: Raw Grinding Plant
Dry grinding requires approximately 30 % more energy / wt. of ground material. Dry mills need more mill volume than comparable wet mills. However, the increased metal wear of the grinding media and the mill liners for wet grinding, equalizes the additional energy costs of dry grinding procedures ~ 30 - 40 % of wear costs in wet grinding.
