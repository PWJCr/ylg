## Clean Coal Technologies | Carbon Capture and Storage | CCS - World 
The greatest challenge is bringing the cost of this down sufficiently for 'clean coal' to compete with nuclear power on the basis of near-zero emissions for base-load power. There is typically at least a 20% energy penalty involved in 'clean coal' processes. World R&D on CCS exceeded $1 billion per year over 2009 to 2013, then fell sharply.

## Coal Cleaning Equipment - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
The Vissac pulsator jig and the Link-Belt heavy-media drum have the greatest capacity per unit area of all the coarse coal cleaning units. The Vissac jig was used to treat sized feeds, and its high capacity can be explained on that basis. The Jeffrey-Baum jig can produce just as much washed coal per unit area as the Link-Belt drum when treating
