## Crushing Mineral Processing
In mineral processing, the reduction of minerals by crushing and grinding may be regarded as having one or other of two main objectives: the attainment of a size appropriate for the direct industrial application of the mineral, e.g. barytes, sand, aggregate; or the release of metallic or ore inclusions from an unwanted matrix with a view to maximum separation.

## Crushing and Screening for Ore Sorting Success - Sepro Aggregates
Ore sorting is one of the oldest methods of mineral processing - there are documents from antiquity that show people hand-picking rocks containing valuable metals and minerals, while discarding the barren ones.  A typical crushing circuit will generate a reduction ration between 5:1 and 7:1 for maximum efficiency. For example, to generate

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

There are two reasons one might choose to analyze minerals that are finer than sand-sized: in some cases, the grain size of the sample may simply be smaller; in other cases, one might wish to crush a sample to avoid pervasive small inclusions or intergrowths, or one might crush samples as part of the analytical process, for example to separate
