## Utilization of Quarry Dust as a Partial Replacement of Sand in Concrete 
The increase in compressive strength with inclusion of quarry dust was attributed to the higher specific gravity of quarry dust above river sand. The compressive strength of quarry dust concrete continued to increase with age for all the percentages of quarry dust contents. Quarry dust was recommended as a suitable partial replacement for river

## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine  - Hindawi
The partial replacement of quarry dust gave a 28 days' peak compressive strength at 40% replacement level and decreases for 50% replacement. Figure 3 shows the compressive strength relation for both normal concrete and quarry dust concrete, at the age of 28 days for M30, M25, and M20 grades of concrete for different w/c ratios of 0.45 and 0.5.

investigated the partial replacement of sand with quarry dust. Initially cement concrete cube was studied with various proportions of cement concrete + quarry dust (M 20, AND M25). The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust as fine aggregate ratio of 30%, 40% and 50% was found to enhance the compressive properties.

## Effect of Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement of Sand in Concrete 
The reduction in the sources of natural sand and the requirement for reduction in the cost of concrete production has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregates in the production of concretes especially in Concrete. Quarry dust, a by-product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials.

##  Partial Replacement of Sand by Quarry Dust in Construction of Box Culvert
partial replacement of sand by Quarry dust by 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. The compressive strength of concrete cubes are obtained after 7 and 28 days of curing. This experimental study shows that the concrete made with quarry dust might not be as workable as normal concrete but it gives higher strength than the conventional concrete.

## Studies on quarry dust as partial replacement of fine  - SlideShare
Quarry dust can be used as an economic alternative to the natural sand. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize quarry dust as a partial substitute for natural sand in producing concrete. Natural sand is replaced by Quarry dust at an interval of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. Mix proportions for M20 concrete is prepared with reference

## manufacturing process of quarry dust
It is the byproduct occurred while crushing of coarse aggregate such as stones, rocks etc this dust obtained as a waste from the quarrying activity can be utilized for various purposes Testing of quarry dust Specific gravity of quarry dust and sand is almost similar and ranges from 262 to 270 for zone II Whereas density is 1520 to 1680 KgThe
