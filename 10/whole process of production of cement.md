## Cement - Analysis - IEA
Initial estimates suggest that 4.3 Gt of cement were produced globally in 2020. This is a modest increase from 4.2 Gt the previous year, driven in large part by infrastructure-related stimulus projects in China. China is the largest cement producer, accounting for about 55% of global production, followed by India at 8%.

## Cement Manufacturing Process - All About Engineering
In the process of manufacturing cement, the first step is the crushing of raw materials. These raw materials contain limestone and clay or shale. Usually, the material is crushed in a tube mill. In the tube mill, there are steel balls. This process can be done in wet or dry conditions depending on the product in use but in dry process, the

tation of the whole cement manufacturing process. Raw materials sis burned to produce clinker. The clinker is cooled down with air in a grate cooler and then stored in the clinker silo. Additives such as gypsum and limestone are added to the clinker before being milled in the cement mills to the final cement product.

To produce concrete, four different materials are mixed together. At the first stage in the production of cement, limestone and clay are crushed to form a powder. This powder is then mixed before it passes into a rotating heater. After heating, the resulting mixture is ground, and cement is produced. Finally, the cement is packaged in large bags.

## PROCESS OF CEMENT AND CONCRETE PRODUCTION
The process continues with grinding the material, and then cement is produced. At the final stage, cement is packaged into bags and is ready for the production of concrete. The first step of making concrete is combining different materials. Cement is mixed with water, sand and small stones in the proportions of 10%, 25% and 50% respectively.

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.
