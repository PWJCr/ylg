## Construction Aggregates 101: What They Are (and Why They Matter) - AEM
Jul 8, 2021Aggregate production dates back to the Roman Empire, and it has been critical to the growth of our world ever since. Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up over 90% of an asphalt pavement and up to 80% of a concrete mix.
