The reagents used for flotation are generally not toxic, which means that tailing disposal costs are low. Flotation will frequently be used when gold is recovered in conjunction with other metals such as copper, lead, or zinc. Flotation concentrates are usually sent to an off-site smelting facility for recovery of gold and base metals.

By Travis Thornton May 31, 2022. A process called "Cyanidation", or cyanide leaching, has been the dominant gold extraction technology since the 1970s. In this process sodium cyanide, in a dilute solution of ranging from 100 ppm to 500 ppm or 0.01% to 0.05% cyanide, is used to selectively dissolve gold from ore.
