## A physical process for recycling and reusing waste printed circuit boards
This paper presents a practical physical process for recycling waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) as well as the reusing process for epoxy resin recovered from PCBs. A special crusher with extra extruding, impacting and shearing forces was developed. With this crusher, the glass-reinforced PCBs could be readily crushed to proper granularity. In order to reduce the toxic gases and dusts

## Crushing Process Sample Calculations For Wastes Printed Circuit Boards
Original Research Logistics Of The Electronic Waste. boards where the influence of grain size on the precision of chemical analysis of printed circuit boards waste PCBs stemming from mobile phones MPs has been investigated Based on the chemical analysis of copper content in the sample the highest metal content in PCBs with grain size d200 m copper content was 155 and dispersion
