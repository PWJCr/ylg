The large REE mining operations are located primarily in China, although four other mines are also operating in Russia, the U.S., India, and Australia. Additional REE mines are up-and-coming, but the world does not yet rely on these mines for supply. The number of open REE deposits may also be due to the relative newness of the market for REEs.

In 2012 five steam generators from UK plants were shipped to Studsvik in Sweden for recycling. Studsvik has also set up a plant in the UK, at Lillyhall in Cumbria, to recycle materials from nuclear facilities, and this became fully operational in 2013 after processing 2000 t of metal from numerous sites and recycling 96% of it.

## What Would it Cost to Build a Bitcoin Mining Rig Today?
For example, one featured Bitcoin mining rig costs USD $1,767 to build and operate and generates $4.56 in profit per day at current prices. Thus, it would need to run for 387 days to become profitable. Factored into this number are electricity costs. Also, however, is the fact that even after breaking even the rigs will consume electricity.
