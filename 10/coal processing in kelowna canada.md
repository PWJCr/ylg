## Coal Mining in British Columbia - EnergyBC
A 2011 study by Price Waterhouse Cooper for the Coal Association of Canada estimated 17,600 British Columbians were directly employed in coal mining and those jobs paid sky-high wages. The accounting firm estimated that the average weekly wage was $1,830, double the wages of people working in manufacturing and higher than any other heavy industry.

## Coal | Properties, Formation, Occurrence and Uses - Geology Science
Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.
