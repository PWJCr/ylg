## Stop Using Limestone Screenings / Crusher Dust / Stone Dust for Pavers 
When comparing stone dust vs sand, this sand is definitely an acceptable material to use under pavers. It provides drainage, wont eat away at the pavers, and it compacts well. With the compaction of the pavers, the sand will work its way into the joints of the pavers from below creating that interlock that is required in an interlocking system.
