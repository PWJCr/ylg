Kaolinite has a low shrink-swell capacity and a low cation-exchange capacity, making it ideal for many industrial applications. Uses. During 2013, 48% of Kaolin was used in paper production, and 52% was used for ceramics, light bulbs, paint, rubber, adhesives, smoking pipes, whitewash in masonry, absorbents, and in soap.

## Kaolinite Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC Machine
The kaolinite dry mining process is a simple and economical process. The ore is crushed to 25.4mm by a hammer crusher and fed into the cage mill to reduce the particle size to 6.35mm. The hot air in the cage mill reduces the moisture of the kaolin from about 20% to 10%. The crushed ore is further ground by a blown-type Raymond mill equipped

## What Are The Industrial Uses For Kaolin - Gravel Mill
Summary: Kaolin is a type of clay found in nature, It has a variety of other uses in products including papermaking, paint, rubber, cable insulation, specialty films and fertilizers. Kaolin is a white or clay-like rock with various hues consisting mainly of tiny flaky or tubular kaolinite mineral crystals smaller than 2 microns.

## kaolinite | Janet Davis Explores Colour
When the volcanic rhyolitic bedrock (quartz and feldspar) is bathed by the acidic water and steam in the underground plumbing that feeds the mud spring, the feldspar breaks down into a clay mineral called kaolinite. Though kaolinite (China clay) is also mined traditionally, it is the principal mineral in the Paint Pots mud.

The first step in the wet process is to fractionate the kaolin slurry into a coarse and fine fraction through continuous centrifuges or by settling in large hydroseparators or vats. The coarse fraction can be used as filler in paper, plastics, paint, and adhesives and for many of the same applications as the dry processed kaolin.

Compared with other clay minerals, kaolinite is chemically and structurally simple. It is described as a 1:1 or TO clay mineral because its crystals consist of stacked TO layers. Each TO layer consists of a tetrahedral ( T) sheet composed of silicon and oxygen ions bonded to an octahedral ( O) sheet composed of oxygen, aluminum, and hydroxyl ions.
