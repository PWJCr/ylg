## Use of Copper Slag As Fine Aggregate ‐ a Case Study
The results indicate that the use of copper slag in concrete increases the flexural strength of about 17% with that of control mixture. It is recommended that up to 40% of copper slag can be use as replacement of fine aggregates.

## Effect of copper slag as a fine aggregate on the properties of cement 
Beyond that, the absorption rate increased rapidly and the percentage volume of the permeable voids was comparable to the control mixture. Therefore, it is recommended that up to 40-50% (by weight of sand) of copper slag can be used as a replacement for fine aggregates in order to obtain a concrete with good strength and durability requirements.

Jul 13, 2022Copper slag and steel slag are used as conductive fine aggregates in the development of ECM and tire waste, a coarser petroleum by-product is also used as fine aggregate substitute. Results indicated that the presence of high content of (Fe_2O_3) in copper slag increased the conductive property of ECM.

## Properties of Concrete Using Copper Slag as a Substitute for Fine Aggregate
The physical and chemical properties of copper slag were investigated. Copper slag, in amounts of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 percent, was substituted for fine aggregate in cement mortar and concrete. The fineness modulus of the combination of copper slag and fine aggregate was roughly 2.6, the optimum fineness modulus for concrete mix design.

In chemistry, mineral hydration is an inorganic chemical reaction which adds water to the crystal structure of a mineral, usually creating a new mineral, usually called a hydrate.. In geological terms, the process of mineral hydration is known as retrograde alteration and is a process occurring in retrograde metamorphism.It commonly accompanies metasomatism and is often a feature of wall rock

Cu slag can also be used as fine aggregates in the hot-mix asphalt concrete [ 20 ]. The result indicated a compressive strength reduction as the Cu slag content increased within the mixes when compared to the reference mix (standard concrete), while 10% replacement improved the indirect tensile strength.

## Experimental Investigation Of Copper Slag Replacement Of Fine Aggregate 
Many researchers have already found it possible to use copper slag as a concrete aggregate, because copper slag has similar particle size characteristics likely to that of sand. Fine grained powder of copper slag can be used as a supplementary cementing material to concrete and in cement clinker production.

Slag is a byproduct of metal smelting, and hundreds of tons of it are produced every year all over the world in the process of refining metals and making alloys.Like other industrial byproducts, slag actually has many uses, and rarely goes to waste.

## Copper Slag - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Copper slag, which is the waste material produced in the extraction process of copper metal in refinery plants, has low cost, and its application as a fine aggregate in concrete production reaps many environmental benefits, such as waste recycling, and solves disposal problems. From: The Utilization of Slag in Civil Infrastructure Construction

## copper slag used as a fine aggregate - Microsoft Bing Search
The use of copper slag as a replacement for fine aggregate in construction will reduce damage to the environment due to the waste resulting from the copper manufacturing process and help in saving natural resources. In this research, the use of copper slag as a replacement for fine aggregate is investigated. Three slender reinforced concrete

## Concrete mix design using copper slag as fine aggregate - SlideShare
Here the potential use of granulated copper slag, a relatively heavy material, as a replacement to sand in concrete mixes is explored. The effect of replacing fine aggregate by copper slag on the compressive strength, flexural strength and split tensile strength of concrete are studied in this work. The proposed mix design method was found to
