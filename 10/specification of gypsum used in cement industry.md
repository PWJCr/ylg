## Role of Gypsum in Cement and its Effects - The Constructor
Role of Gypsum in Cement. The main purpose of adding gypsum in the cement is to slow down the hydration process of cement once it is mixed with water. The process involved in hydration of cement is that, when the water is added into cement, it starts reacting with the C3A and hardens. The time taken in this process is very less, which doesn't

##  Analysis of anhydrite gypsum effects on quality of cement
Key Words: anhydrite, gypsum, clinker, cement 1.INTRODUCTION As it is well known, the workability property of cement solutions depends on reaction rate of C 3 A with water and to justify this, retarder raw materials are used. In cement industry, natural gypsum (CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O) is the most effective raw material for this purpose.
