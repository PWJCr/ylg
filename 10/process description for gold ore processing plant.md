## Rock Gold Processing Plant
Rock gold processing plant is the most efficient method to separate and recovery the old in rock gold mine. The recovery rate can be more than 95% after using gravity concentration and gold CIL (carbon in leaching) ways. The most single coarse gold ore can be separated by the gravity concentration, the fine gold and some gold tailings can be

## Different Gold Ore Processing Methods for 5 Kinds of Gold Ore
According to the degree of ore oxidation, gold ore can be divided into primary (sulfide ore) ore, partially oxidized (mixed) ore and oxidized ore. Here are the different kind of gold ore processing methods used for five types of gold ore . Poor sulfide gold ore processing. Polysulfide gold ore processing. Gold-bearing polymetallic ore processing.

Gold flotation. Flotation process is widely used for lode gold processing. In most cases, the flotation method has a good effect in sulfide-containing gold ore with high floatability. In addition, the flotation process is also used for polymetallic gold-bearing ores such as gold-copper, gold-lead, gold-copper-lead-zinc-sulfur ore.
