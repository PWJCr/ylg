All rock crushers can be divided into two main categories. Compression crushers crush the material until it is broken, and impact crushers use the rapid impact principle to break the material. Jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, and cone crushers operate according to the compression principle. In turn, impact crushers utilize the impact principle.
