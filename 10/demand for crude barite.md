The results suggest that the demand for crude oil is price inelastic and income elastic in the region. Further, the negative coefficient of electricity confirms that in the long run, electricity acts as a substitute for crude oil. Thus, the extensive use of electricity may help in reducing the demand for crude oil in the South-Asian countries.
