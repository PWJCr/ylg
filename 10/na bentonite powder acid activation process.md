ACID-ACTIVATED BENTONITES Acid activation is a process in which bentonites (typically the Ca 2+ form) are partially dissolved using acidic solutions in order to replace Ca 2+ with protons and to leach out Al 3+, Fe3+, and Mg 2+ from the silicate layers. The partially dissolved material has increased surface area, porosity, and surface acidity.

## na bentonite powder acid activation process - Bing
· Activation of bentonite clay Acid activation of bentonite clay was performed. Bentonite was activated with 1 M HCl (the mass ratio of clay and acid has been 1:5) at 100 rpm (magnetic stirrer, MSH-30A, Witeg, Germany), at an increased temperature of 70 °C. After 5 h of activation, the sus-pension was filtrated through a Büchner funnel. Acti-

Na-bentonite (Na-B) is primarily comprised of Na +-montmorillonite with a cation exchange capacity of 75.4 meq/100 g determined via the ammonium acetate method . The chemical compositions of the montmorillonite involve 62.5% of SiO 2, 18.5% of Al 2 O 3, 1.75% of Fe 2 O 3, 4.25% of MgO, 0.95% of CaO, and 2.75% of Na 2 O.
