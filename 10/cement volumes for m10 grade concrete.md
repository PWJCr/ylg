Step 5: Cement Content Calculation. From step 2, Water cement ratio = W/C = 0.57. From step 4, Water content W = 191.6 liters = 191.6kg. 191.6 / C = 0.57. Finally, C = 336.14 Kg / m 3 of concrete. But from table 5 of IS, Minimum cement content required for moderate exposure condition for M15 grade concrete is = 240 Kg/m 3 of concrete.

## How many cement bags and sand is required for M20 grade of concrete 
Required Weight of cement = volume of cement x bulk density of cement. Required Weight of cement = 0.285 cu.m x 1440 kg/cu.m. Required Weight of cement = 410 kg. No of cement bags required = 410/50. No of cement bags required = 8.2 bags i.e. approximately 8 Nos. Hence, 8 bags of cement are required to prepare one cubic meter of M20 grade concrete.

## How to calculate sand cement volumes for m grade concrete
Mar 26, 2021 How to calculate concrete: Now we will use dry volume in concrete calculation to get Quantity of Cement, Sand & Aggregate for 1:2:4 concrete mix calculation. Ratio of concrete mix (Grade M15) = 1:2:4. Sum of ratio = 7. Cement calculator for Concrete: Quantity of Cement = (1 7) 962.5 = 137.5 Cft; Cement = (1 7) 27.25 = 3.9 Cum

## Cement Volumes For M10 Grade Concrete
M10 concrete mix design Steps IS IS. The nominal mix for M10 grade is (136). The quality of concrete depends on a number of factors and the standard mix just gives us a rough estimate of the quantities of material required, this is exactly where a design mix procedure is required as it is evident from the results that for the same mix proportion when exposure and material properties

M15 concrete grade concrete gets categorized as an ordinary grade. Its features, properties, and uses are quite close to M10 with a very slight difference.. PROPERTIES OF THE M15 GRADE CONCRETE: It contains a mix ratio is 1:3:6.1 cement .3 sand and six aggregate.M-15 M represents the mix, while 15 N/mm2 is the concrete cube's characteristic compressive strength for 29 days.

## how to calculate sand cement volumes for m10 grade concrete
Weight of cement needed = volume of cement × 28.8 = 0.224 × 28.8 = 6.45. Hence, we require 323 Kg or 6.5 bags of cement for 1m 3 of concrete. Sand; Usually sand consists eases the volume of sand due to bulking of sand effect. That is density of sand varies = 1600 - 1800 kg/m 3. here we use 1600kg/m 3.
