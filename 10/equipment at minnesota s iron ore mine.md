As it turned out, the iron would become more valuable to northern Minnesota than the gold. Iron ore was discovered on the three iron ranges at different times. The first ore shipped from the Vermilion Range was in 1884, the Mesabi Range in 1892, and the Cuyuna Range in 1911. The mines were operated through the hard work of the miners.

Operations went underground by 1892 since the ore body continued deep into the ground. The mine's value was in the special kind of ore it produced. The ore's high oxygen content was used to make high-quality steel in open-hearth

Local blast furnaces furnished an outlet for much of the early iron ore production. Up to 1903, all Michigan pig iron was smelted with charcoal. At that time coke from coal was introduced
