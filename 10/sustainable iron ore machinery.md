## Developing a zero-carbon method for processing iron ore
Steel is made from iron, which comes from iron ore, which is a combination of iron oxides (Fe x O y) and various mineral components. The current method for processing iron ore is by melting it in a blast furnace, causing the iron oxide to separate from the other parts of the ore. Hot oxygen interacts with coal in the furnace to create carbon
