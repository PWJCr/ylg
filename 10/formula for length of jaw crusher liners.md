## How it Works: Crushers, Grinding Mills and Pulverizers
Table Source: Wikipedia (Crushers) Cone crushers use a spinning cone that gyrates in the bowl in an eccentric motion to crush the rock between the cone surface, referred to as the mantle, and the crusher bowl liner.Gyratory crushers are very similar to cone crushers, but have a steeper cone slope and a concave bowl surface. As the gap between the bowl liner and the mantle narrows, the rock is

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.  Crushing area length Around double the gape width W: Crushing area width Varies between 1.3 and 3 times the gape width.
