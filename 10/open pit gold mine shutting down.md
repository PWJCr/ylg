## Mine shut down after pollution spill at Yellow Giant gold mine
Mon, Jul 27 - Due to environmental concerns, the province has shut down the small Yellow Giant underground gold mine. The mine is on Banks Island in Northwest BC. It was recently discovered that the mine had spilled pollution on land and the surrounding creeks, lakes and wetlands. The discharge then made its way to the ocean.

## What Happens When a Mine Closes?
Mining exposes sulfur-containing rocks to air and water at an increased rate, thus creating dissolved iron and sulfuric acid. The resulting acid run-off can dissolve heavy metals like lead, copper, and mercury, thus leading them to leach into surface water sources and groundwater aquifers, causing a risk of serious harm to humans and wildlife.

The mine operated until 1941, when wartime economic pressure caused the mine to shut down. In 1981 Westmin Resources owned the property, and after undertaking a drill program started operations on the old Silback - Premier property in 1989. A mill was built and open pit mining and an underground mining operation began in March of 1989.

## Open-Pit Mining Definition | Anglo American
Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, is a surface mining technique that extracts minerals from an open pit in the ground. Open-pit mining is the most common method used throughout the world for mineral mining and does not require extractive methods or tunnels. This surface mining technique is used when mineral or ore deposits are

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Open Pit Mining | Design, Planning & Engineering | SRK
Open Pit Mine Design, Planning, and Engineering. The bulk of the world's minerals come from open pit mines where large volumes of rock must be moved while keeping costs low. Since profit margins depend on cyclical metal prices, optimal mine design and scheduling are vital. Drawing on our world-wide industry experience, we develop practical
