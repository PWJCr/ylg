## build conveyor
The shipping charges or the fact that most of the ones on eBay are 3 phase make it impractical for me to buy one for a one time job. There are no places locally that rent them. A conveyor seems to be just a metal frame with a roller on each end and a belt in the middle powered by some kind of motor that drives a chain with sprockets on each end.

Jan 20, 2021Cleaning up around the conveyor is the source of about a third of all conveyor accidents. Most standards allow the tail pulley and the bottom of the return idlers to be only 300 mm from the floor. If the conveyor was undersized or tends to wander back and forth, spillage in excess of 300 mm deep can accumulate in just minutes.

So this was the perfect little toy to whip up. Here's how I made this conveyor belt: 1. First, I washed and dried a milk carton. 2. Then, I cut off the top pointy bit and two opposite sides of the milk carton. 3. Then, I ripped out two pairs of holes on opposite sides of the carton. I made them big enough to hold my pens.

Do-it-yourselfers can build their own mills for home use, with excellent results. At one time or another, serious home brewers travel down the road to all-grain brewing. A critical step in this process is crushing the grain. Some brewers purchase their grain precrushed, while others use a mill at a local homebrew shop.

Prepare an 8 mm slot at one end of each steel bar to allow the tightener to work. The bar I bought only had 6 mm slots, so I needed to drill 8 mm holes for each roller and create an 8 mm slot for the tightener. Attach a roller bearing assembly to your metal bars at each roller position. Prepare the drive roller.
