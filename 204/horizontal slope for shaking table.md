## Dynamic acceleration response of a rock slope with a horizontal weak 
Apr 21, 2021The weak interlayer in a rock slope often plays a significant role in seismic rockslides; however, the effect of weak interlayer on the seismic slope response and damage process is still not fully understood. This study presents a series of shaking test tests on two model slopes containing a horizontal weak interlayer with different thicknesses. A recorded Wenchuan earthquake ground motion was

## Steep slope in geographypara-koszalin.pl
Slope can be defined as the angle, inclination, steepness, or gradient of a straight line. Slope often is used to describe the steepness of the ground's surface. Slope can be measured as the rise (the increase in elevation in some unit of measure) over the run (the horizontal distance measured in the same units as the rise).

## Shaking Table Model Test to Determine Dynamic Response  - SpringerLink
Mar 19, 2022A model of a steep bedding rock slope with a slope angle of 50° and rock dip angle of 55° was designed and fabricated, and a large-scale shaking table test was carried out to investigate the acceleration, displacement, acoustic emission, and failure mode under earthquake action. In the vertical direction of the slope, the acceleration amplification factor significantly increased as the
