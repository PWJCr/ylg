## Gravel Calculator
Crushed stone. Crushed stone is a type of medium-sized gravel that is formed by mechanically crushing stone. Most commonly, limestone, dolomite, or granite is crushed to form the crushed stone. In certain definitions of the term, crushed stone is not considered gravel since it is a processed rather than naturally-occurring rock fragment.

4 days agoOn the other hand, a cubic yard box filled with crushed limestone rocks weighs around 1.2 tons to 1.7 tons, depending on the average size of the rocks. Solid limestone weighs a lot heavier than crushed limestone rocks since in crushed limestone rocks, we now also consider air in the total cubic yard volume.

## Trying to guess how many man hours to spread pea gravel.
Assuming pea gravel is 32/ton my costand we need 9 ton. I would charge customer 50/ton plus any applicable delivery charges. I can only handle 4 ton at a time (legally) so I would have it delivered. 3'x300' roll landscape fabric will run customer about depending how much is required. 50 misc expenses and 50 fuel surcharge.

Square feet divided by sq. ft. per yard (from chart) = cubic yards needed. Example: A rectangular area 16 feet long by 10 feet wide and you want 4 inches deep of stone. Calculations: 16 x 10 = 160 square feet. 160 divided by 81 = 2 cubic yards (81 comes from the chart, 81 is how many square feet 1 cubic yard covers at a 4 inch depth)
