## Use Of Recycled Aggregate In Concrete - IJERT
Mirza and Saif3 have studied the effect of silica fume on recycled aggregate concrete characteristics. The percentages of recycled aggregate replacements of natural aggregate used by weight were 0, 50, and 100%, whereas the percentages of silica fume replacements of cement used by weight were 5, 10, and 15%. The results.

## Fdot approved aggregate sourcesramaker
Construction aggregate materials are a critical need with respect to construction of the state's transportation system.4 The FDOT has a standardized method for producers5 of construction aggregate materials to apply for, receive, and maintain the FDOT's approval of construction aggregate sources for use on FDOT projects.
