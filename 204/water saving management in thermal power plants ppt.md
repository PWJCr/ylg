The GEOSS Water Strategy Report (WSR) "From Observations to Decisions (2014)" identifies several key water variables as Essential Water Variables (EWVs). This was based on an earlier (2010) meta-survey of water-related observational needs for GEO Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs). EWVs have also been surveyed by GEOGLOWS for operational relevance.

## Water Consumption Management for Thermal Power Plant
All the new power plants that are proposed to be established after 1 January 2017 are required to use a maximum of 2.5 m 3 /MWH as specific water consumption and achieve zero liquid discharge (ZLD). The current paper discusses water resource management for thermal power plants.

Reducing industrial water consumption is a means of addressing the global water crisis. As of 1999, industrial water use accounted for 5-10% of global freshwater withdrawals. The majority of all industrial water use is from the cooling of power plants. This factsheet provides an overview of how to save and use water more efficiently in industries.

## How is thermal pollution of water linked?hcharge
Solution : Thermal power plants located near water bodies use water for cooling the machineries and release the hot water back into the water bodies. This affects the aquatic life. The hot water can hold less oxygen compared to normal water. The reduction in the percentage of oxygen in water affects fish like trout.

IEA Clean Coal Centre - Water conservation in coal-fired power plants 9 between power plant operators and other water users is likely to escalate, and climate change could further exacerbate the situation. Regulatory restraints by governments may impose limits on, or increase the cost of, fresh water usage by power plants.

## Water saving in thermal power plant by use of membrane filter in 
Jun 13, 2022The cycles of concentration in cooling tower was increased by installation of membrane system. The drain of the side stream filter was disposed to effluent treatment plant (ETP), while the filtered water will be recycled to the cooling tower inlet. The water parameter was measured by using various flow rates, pressure, and other factors.
