## Small-Scale Mining in Africa: Tackling Pressing Environmental Problems 
Small-scale mining—low-tech mineral extraction and processing—has long been an important industry in Africa. For centuries, operations have provided inhabitants of the rural, more impoverished regions of the continent with a wealth of employment benefits and, more recently, have made important contributions to mineral wealth and foreign exchange earnings.

## Artisanal & Small-Scale Mining - International Tin Association
One of the tin mining industry's unique characteristics is the significant contribution of artisanal and small scale miners (ASM) to the global tin marketplace. Almost all (~97%) of the world's primary refined tin arises and is mined in emerging and developing countries and in a typical year around 40% of that has its origins in ASM.
