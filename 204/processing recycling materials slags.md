## High performance cementing materials from industrial slags — a review 
Iron blast furnace slag is formed in the process of pig iron manufacture from iron ore, combustion residue of coke, limestone and other materials. The molten slag appears above the pig iron at the bottom. Its temperature is close to that of the iron, which is between 1400 and 1600°C. The slag rises to the surface and is tapped off from time to

## processing recycling materials slags
Recycling: Prior to processing, some steel slag is recycled to blast furnaces, directly or as agglomerates, as a source of iron and flux materials. The exact amount recycled is not known; however, it may be as high as 80% of the steel slag generated each year. Ferrous scrap, recovered from slag during processing, is also recycled to blast and steel
