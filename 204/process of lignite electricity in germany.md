## Why lignite is used in thermal power plant?
How is lignite used for energy? Uses. Since lignite has a relatively low energy density, the coal is burned close to the mines (known as mine mouth operations).  79% of all lignite coal is used in these boilers to generate electricity, and 13.5% is used to generate synthetic natural gas.A small 7.5% is used to produce various fertilizer products.

Lignite currently accounts for 46 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the German electricity industry. Accordingly, the lignite industry plays a key role in restructuring the energy system. At the same time, lignite power stations are currently under significant economic pressure - this is one of the key findings of the study.

## Germany's three lignite mining regions | Clean Energy Wire
Germany has been the largest lignite producer in the world since the beginning of industrial lignite mining. It still is, followed by China, Russia, and the United States. The softer and moister lignite (also called brown or soft coal) has a lower calorific value than hard coal and can only be mined in opencast operations. When burned, it is more CO2 intensive than hard coal.

## Refined coal
Refined coal is the product of the coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals, raising their calorific values. Coal refining or upgrading technologies are typically pre-combustion treatments and/or processes that alter the characteristics of a coal before it is burned.

The largest known lignite deposit at the present time is at Mae Moh. It is to be fully developed for power production by EGAT. The lignite can be produced by open-pit mining methods, and production costs are low. In 1978 average mining costs per ton of all lignite mines in Thailand were only $4.20/ton.

The three nuclear reactors Grohnde, Gundremmingen C and Brokdorf, with a total capacity of just over 4 GW, were taken off the grid on 31 December.

Hydrogen generation via fuel cell or turbine will likely be far more flexible than a plant operating with carbon capture. Where an extensive hydrogen network existed, local hydrogen 'peaking' plants could be used to support the grid as demand changed. Due to the short operational runs, hydrogen would provide a green solution.

The accord between the German government and energy companies RWE, Vattenfall and Mibrag to put 2.7 GW of lignite-fired power capacity into reserve, will not be enough to wean Germany off lignite, writes Hamburg-based US energy expert Jeffrey Michel. The lignite sector is too well entrenched and lignite mining profitable enough to subsidize the loss-making power production.

## Commission clears support for lignite closures in Germany
In Germany, where the electricity market is currently characterised by overcapacity, lignite is still a major source of power, accounting for 24% of total electricity generated in 2015. The eight plants to be commissioned account for around 13% of the total German lignite fuelled generating capacity.

## process of lignite electricity in germany
The results underline the great energy demand of lignite extraction in West-Germany. With reference to the energy contents of lignite, the fraction of primary energy demands for its mining amounts to about 6.2%. This accounts to 93.8 % of the lignite energy content being available as usable energy for further processes, which is obviously

## Lignite generation in Germany | European Gas Hub
In Germany, for the past four weeks, public net electricity generation from gas has been higher than from lignite. This has never happened before, not even in one week. The main reasons are the low gas prices and the high prices for CO2 certificates.
