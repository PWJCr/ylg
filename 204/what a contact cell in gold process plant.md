## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
The process produces gold of up 99.5% purity. A repeat of the process may further improve the purity of gold produced by this method. Gold smelting is an important process in the production of gold. It enables gold miners to separate impurity materials from pure gold that is desirable in the market. Smelting often produces gold to the purity

Water is then added to the process to create a mud-like slurry that is pumped into a thickener where gold-bearing particles sink to the bottom and are passed to downstream processing. Typically, the next processing phase is a CIL, CIP or CIC circuit. All these methods use cyanide and activated carbon to extract the gold from the slurry.

After the gold ore has been removed from the earth using mining equipment, it is sent to a gold processing plant. The typical gold processing plant begins with a cone crusher, to reduce the particle size of the ore. Next, it is loaded on a conveyor belt, where an overbelt magnet removes tramp metal from the gold mining process.

The process also produces carbon monoxide. This is a problem because carbon monoxide 'poisons' the platinum catalyst that is used in a fuel cell. It becomes less efficient and eventually stops working. Gold could replace the platinum as a catalyst in the fuel cells. Not only is it cheaper, but gold is not affected by carbon monoxide.

The cells have a hydrodynamic design, which ensures that flow is through the whole cell volume and electrodes are evenly consumed. The cells use upward flow to sweep out all hydrogen and oxygen bubbles produced during the process to flotation/sedimentation tanks and to prevent sediment build-up in the cells.
