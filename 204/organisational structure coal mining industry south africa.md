Mining safety. The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.
