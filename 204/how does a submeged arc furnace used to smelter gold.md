Cable used outdoors between the telephone company's central office and the building being served is referred to as outside cable, or sometimes called black cable. Wire or cable used indoors, e.g., inside homes and commercial buildings, is referred to as premises distribution wiring or more simply as inside cable.

## Modelling of ferrosilicon smelting in submerged arc furnaces
Ferrosilicon alloys are commonly manufactured in submerged electric arc furnaces with little slag. In the presence of iron, silica will be reduced by carbon to give a maximum of ~ 22 wt% silicon in the liquid alloy. The rest of the carbon will be consumed to transform silica to silicon carbide at ~ 1810 K. Higher grades of ferrosilicon alloy
