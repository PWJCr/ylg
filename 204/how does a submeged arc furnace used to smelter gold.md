Ferrosilicon alloys are commonly manufactured in submerged electric arc furnaces with little slag. In the presence of iron, silica will be reduced by carbon to give a maximum of ~ 22 wt% silicon in the liquid alloy. The rest of the carbon will be consumed to transform silica to silicon carbide at ~ 1810 K. Higher grades of ferrosilicon alloy
