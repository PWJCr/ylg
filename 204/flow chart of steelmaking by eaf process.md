Some data from the SMA on EAF Steel: More than 70% of the steel produced in America is EAF Steel. Thanks to this type of process, a car in scrap condition can be transformed to be used for new items used in daily life or as part of new automobiles. EAF Steel grows the industry, which in the long term creates new jobs.

Jan 27, 2021Steelmaking in the electric arc furnace (EAF), either scrap-based or based on hydrogen direct reduced iron, will in future contribute substantially to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the iron and steel industry. However, there still will be the need to introduce carbon into the EAF process either to carburize the steel or to create foaming slag to improve the energy efficiency of the melting

Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) Steelmaking. In this process an electric furnace melts (recycles) steel scrap for the production of liquid steel using electrical power. In BOF steelmaking, the main raw material inputs are iron ore and coal. In EAF steelmaking, the main raw material is ferrous scrap. Currently, scrap represents around 75% of EAF input.

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

In BOF steelmaking, iron ore is one of the ingredients utilized in what is called a blast furnace to generate "pig iron", which in turn is transformed into steel by blowing oxygen into a vessel containing the pig iron, in this manner refining the pig iron.

##  A process model for EAF steelmaking
Key words: EAF, electric arc furnace, modelling, process automation, steel making, melting, DRI, simulation INTRODUCTION Most current Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking makes use of level-2 automation systems [Nil00, Hei97]. The instrumentation of the furnaces allows for a quantitative time dependent measurement of the energy and mass inputs.

## 6 challenges of the EAF process and how to tackle them
Jul 29, 20211. Uncertainty when to start different phases of the EAF process. There are always some levels of uncertainty when operating an EAF process. Especially when timing the different phases of the heat. This is mostly caused by the lack of methods to see into the furnace during the process.
