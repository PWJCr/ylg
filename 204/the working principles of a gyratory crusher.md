Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers. Gyratory and cone crushers are likely to become jammed

## Gyratory Crusher Explained - saVRee
Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and further developed by Gates in 1881 (they were commonly referred to as a 'Gate's crushers' in the early years). A primary crusher is designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines. Gyratory crushers typically crush to reduce the size of aggregate to a maximum

Working Principle of Crushers. Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.
