## Fine Aggregates: Types, Properties & Uses in construction
Introduction to fine aggregates: The maximum size used is 80 mm and the range of 80 mm to 4.75 mn is known as coarse aggregate and 4.75 to 150 µm is called fine aggregate. Size 4.75 mm is common for both fine and coarse fractions. Qualities of fine aggregates:

## Aggregate size| Concrete Construction Magazine
At a given water ratio, within the range employed in most structural concrete, smaller maximum sizes of aggregate will tend to produce higher concrete strengths than larger ones. 2. The larger sizes will require less mixing water and hence, for a given cement factor, will produce concrete of lower water-ratio than the smaller sizes. 3.

## Aggregates - Cement
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

## How Coarse Aggregate Affects Mix Design of Concrete?
Coarse aggregate is one of the essential components of concrete and occupies the largest volume in the mix. That is why it greatly affects the concrete mix design. Its properties such as strength, maximum size, shape, and water absorption influence water demand, the quantity of cement and fine aggregate in concrete mixture.

## Specific Gravity of Coarse Aggregates: Its Importance & Test Procedure
According to ' A. M. Neville ' (Author of the Properties of Concrete), the majority of natural aggregates have a specific gravity of between 2.6 and 2.7. However high specific gravity is considered as an indication of high strength. Water absorption, ideally, shouldn't be more than 0.6%.

## Interview Questions on Aggregates - Civil Bull
Jul 18, 2021What is the importance of aggregates in concrete? Ans. The properties of concrete, such as workability, durability, strength, weight, and shrinkage, are governed by the properties (composition, shape, and size) of aggregate used in the concrete.  The most commonly used coarse aggregate size in road construction is 40 mm, 50mm, 60 mm, or

## importance of size of coarse aggregate
Mar 02, 2018· Results are expressed as mass per volume. For example, a given crushed limestone could weigh 93 lbs./ft.3. By knowing the DRUW of a coarse aggregate, the maximum nominal aggregate size and the fineness modulus of the fine aggregate, the weight of the coarse aggregate needed per cubic yard of concrete mix can be estimated.
