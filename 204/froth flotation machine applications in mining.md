## Differences and Applications of Magnetic Separation and Froth Flotation 
Jul 20, 2022Froth flotation machine is generally used for the concentration of sulphide ores. The principle behind froth flotation process is that sulphide ores are preferentially wetted by pine oil whereas gangue articles are wetted by water. In this process, the suspension of a powdered ore is made with water. Collectors like pine oil, fatty acids and

## Application of Froth Flotation Process in The Rock Type  - Mining-pedia
Froth flotation process is the most widely used method in the rock type gold mining process. The froth flotation process is suitable for treating the gold ore with fine grain, gold-bearing quartz vein ore with good floatability, polymetallic gold-bearing sulfide ore and graphite-bearing gold ore. In this paper, we will explore the application
