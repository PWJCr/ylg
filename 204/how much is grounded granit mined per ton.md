## Mineral Deposit Value - How to Calculate the Potential Value of a 
As you can see in the example above, the deposit does not have to be enormous in size (only 500 meters long by 100 meters wide) to contain a valuable deposit (approximately $6 billion worth of minerals). However, in order to be as realistic as possible about this valuation, you can not assume that the complete ore body contains the same grade (i.e. 2% copper and 1.5 gram per tonne gold).

## Mining
For example, 99 tons of waste is generated per ton of copper, with even higher ratios in gold mining - because only 5.3 g of gold is extracted per ton of ore, a ton of gold produces 200,000 tons of tailings. (As time goes on and richer deposits are exhausted - and technology improves - this number is going down to .5 g and less.)
