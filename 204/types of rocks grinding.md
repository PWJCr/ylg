## Weathering of rocks and minerals (Physical and Chemical)
Weathering processes are of two types:  Wind carrying particles in suspension, like those of sand of rock fragments, and blowing constantly over the rock at great speed exerts a grinding action whereby the rock gets disintegrated. Loosely balanced rock boulders sometimes roll down by the action of wind and break into pieces.
