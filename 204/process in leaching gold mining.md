## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.

Heap leaching can take anything from a couple of months to several years. In the case of gold recovery, heap leaching generally requires 60 to 90 days to leach the ore, compared to the 24 hours required by a conventional agitated leach process. Gold recovery is also usually only 70% compared with 90% recovery in an agitated leach plant.

Radioactive metals, such as uranium are extracted by the process of acid leaching. Choosing the appropriate leaching method for metal extraction is done

## Cycladex, Triple 7 complete gold leaching trials - Mining Magazine
Nevada-based Cycladex has completed scale-up trials of its cyanide-free gold recovery process in Arizona with Triple 7 Mining, and the partners now plan to build a small modular processing plant. The plant will be able to process approximately 15 t/d of ore. Processing > Chemicals-reagents.
