A number of auxiliary materials handling operations are also considered a branch of mineral processing such as storage (as in bin design), conveying, sampling, weighing, slurry transport, and pneumatic transport. The efficiency and efficacy of many processing techniques are influenced by upstream activities such as mining method and blending.

Removing the water makes the minerals easier to handle and more cost-effective to transport, as well as assists with the removal of undesirable material. Dewatering is most often achieved through wet classification, centrifugation or filtration. The water that is removed from the minerals can then be recycled back into the processing plant.

One good solution for determining process optimization is a combined control and diagnostic tool such as Metso 's OCS 4D. In this Advanced Process Control (APC) tool, we use an approach called "Dynamic Constraint Control". It identifies the current limiting aspect of the plant and adjusts production to try to stay close to that limitation.
