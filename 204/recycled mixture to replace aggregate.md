This study addresses the mechanical behaviour of structural concretes made with recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). Particularly, it is intended at investigating the influence of some critical parameters on the actual development of the cement hydration reactions and, then, on the time evolution of the concrete compressive strength.

## Disadvantages of glass powder in concrete
The government of Quebec (Canada) is trying to find a useful outlet for the mixed waste glass pilling up in its landfills. One solution to consider is the use of fine glass powder from mixed waste glass as alternative cementitious materials (ACM) in concrete, using an open-loop circular-economy principle.

## Effect of Recycled Concrete Aggregate Properties on Mixture Proportions 
Fourteen mixture proportions were developed with the use of three mixture proportion scenarios (control, direct replacement, and strength based) and two compressive strength levels (40 and 60 MPa). The effect of RCA on compressive strength and workability was evaluated by replacement of natural coarse aggregate with RCA.

Only up to 10 to 20 percent fine RCA is beneficial. The aggregate should be tested at several substitution rates to determine the optimal rate. Often recycled aggregate is combined with virgin aggregate when used in new concrete. An example of a mix design using recycled aggregates in a pavement application is shown following table.

Do not apply over asphalt that has been sealed with tar because the surface becomes to slick for Portland cement to adhere. Best if applied in early spring on dry days. Driving and walking on powder cement is all it needs for compaction. Note: it makes a minor mess and the cement blows very little. Have fun.

However, using a recycled aggregate of more than 65% can impact the mix's durability significantly, reducing its physical properties tenfold. The optimum amount blended in with the concrete should be 35%. Some experiments have shown that the recycled aggregate is durable, no doubt, but not as sturdy as natural coarse aggregate.

Essentially, asphalt recycling is an inexpensive and environmentally friendly process that utilizes previously existing asphalt materials to create new asphalt products, like streets, driveways, shingles, pavers, and much more. The use of recycled asphalt products has many advantages, which is why public agencies and private contractors alike.
