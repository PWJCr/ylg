## describe a grinding machine
CNC grinding machines - grindaix CNC grinding machines are high-tech machine tools with a broad performance spectrum. Often CNC grinding machines do not work in an optimum operational range, i.e. the machines frequently consume an unnecessary amount of energy or coolant lubricant, thereby causing cycle times which are too high or (ir)regular grinding burn on the ground part.
