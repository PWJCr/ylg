actinolite, an amphibole mineral in the tremolite-actinolite series of calcium, magnesium, and iron silicates. The minerals in this series are abundant in regionally metamorphosed rocks, such as schists. Tremolite may weather to talc, and both tremolite and actinolite may alter to chlorite or carbonates. For chemical formula and detailed physical properties, see amphibole (table).

Amphibolite; Amphibolite is a coarse-grained metamorphic rock, predominantly composed of mineral amphibole and plagioclase feldspar. It can also contain minor amounts of other metamorphic minerals such as biotite, epidote, garnet, wollastonite, andalusite, staurolite, kyanite, and sillimanite.Amphibolite is found around metamorphic and igneous rock intrusions that solidify between other rocks

Actinolite asbestos is green because of the large amount of iron in its crystal structure. However, the iron content in individual specimens varies, with those having the most iron being the darkest green. This form of amphibole asbestos is sometimes found as a thin, splinter-like inclusion inside Quartz crystals.
