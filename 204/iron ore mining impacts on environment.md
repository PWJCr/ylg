## Impact of Mining On The Environment
The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine employees and often vegetation farms are abolished.

## Question: What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore in 
What are the environmental impacts of iron ore mining? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

## Area strip miningo
The total material moved is calculated by multiplying the strip ratio with the ore depleted, then adding the ore depleted. A strip ratio of 10x and a depletion of 4.5 Mtonnes equates to 49.5.

## Iron Ore Mining Impacts Environment
199751 the impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described. mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. in the metal industry, production of cu, pb, and zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment.
