Availability of octocalcium phosphate was less than for the dicalcium phosphates and decreased with increasing liming rates on Hartsells fine sandy loam. A significant correlation was found between the phosphorus extracted by 0.5 N NaHCO 3 and the phosphorus uptake by the two crops from the various phosphates.

Description. Dicalcium Phosphate formula is the calcium phosphate with the formula CaHPO4 and its dihydrate. The "di" prefix in the common name arises because the formation of the HPO42- anion involves the removal of two protons from phosphoric acid, H3PO4. It is also known as dibasic calcium phosphate or calcium monohydrogen phosphate.
