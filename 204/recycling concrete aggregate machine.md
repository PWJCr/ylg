## Recycling of Concrete (Recycling Coarse Aggregate) - IJERT
Recycling of concrete is a simple process. It involves breaking, removing, and crushing existing concrete into a material with a specified size and quality. As per study about 75 to 80% of total construction material consist coarse aggregate portion. When the structure is demolished, the waste concrete in a large quantity is produced.

The reason for recycling is the reduction of waste in order to protect nature against pollution, the increasing shortage of suitable dumping grounds, and to save energy and natural resources. Concrete debris is typically reclaimed as recycled aggregate (RCA). By recycling concrete, valuable landfill space and natural resources are preserved.
