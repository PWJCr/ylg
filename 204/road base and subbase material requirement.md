Naturally occurring granular materials (natural gravels/sand-clay/soft and fissile rock), which do not require costly extraction or crushing processes. They are an important source of material used in the pavement (base and subbase) and shoulder construction of flexible pavements in Australia. Crushed rock, which is produced by the crushing and

The minimum strength requirement for capping (lower sub base/improved sub grade) is a laboratory soaked California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of 15% after 4 days soaking at 95% MDD (modified). For road pavements the thickness of capping is detailed in ICTAD Publication No: SCA/5 and is directly related to the subgrade CBR.

## Sub-bases | Pavingexpert
The sub-base layer is often the main load-bearing layer of a pavement. It is designed to evenly spread the load of the paving, and any traffic thereon, to the sub-grade below. A well-constructed sub-base will aid drainage and prevent settlement and channelisation - the phenomenon common on cheap installations of block paving, where two 'ruts' develop in the paving.

The entire subbase and base system should be at least 4 inches thick—thicker if the engineer feels it is needed for proper support.

## Materials Used for the Construction of Roads: Methods, Process, Layers 
Binder materials such as bitumen and cement mixed with appropriate types and proportions of aggregates are used for the construction of superior types of roads that are characterised by their durability and load-carrying capacity. Thus, base courses, sub-base courses and even the surface or wearing courses require the use of these materials. 1
