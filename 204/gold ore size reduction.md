Without such feed-size reduction, however, additional pebble-crushing power may be of little benefit, because pebble generations can be quite low.  Dry grinding is an important, albeit niche, application in gold-ore processing. For any pyrometallurgical operation, dry grinding is an obvious consideration.

## Gold extraction - QueensMineDesignWiki
Comminution is the process where ore particles are liberated from gangue material through progressive size reduction in the form of crushing, grinding, cutting or vibrating. The costs associated with power supply, grinding media, and liners used in comminution circuits almost always represent the single largest cost in gold extraction processes
