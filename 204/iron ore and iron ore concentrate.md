## Environmental impact of iron ore mining
Introduction Iron ore. Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3). Hematite and magnetite are the most common

## Iron ore
Of the iron ore exported 38.5% of the volume was iron ore pellets with a value of $2.3 billion and 61.5% was iron ore concentrates with a value of $2.3 billion. Forty-six per cent of Canada's iron ore comes from the Iron Ore Company of Canada mine, in Labrador City, Newfoundland, with secondary sources including, the Mary River Mine, Nunavut.

It is considered an essential mineral for our body and its deficiency leads to various ailments. Iron ores make up nearly 5% of the earth's crust, and when we consider both the crust as well as inner core, iron and its ores make up about 35% of the mass of the earth.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
