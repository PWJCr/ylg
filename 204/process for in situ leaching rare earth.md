## Leaching process of weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore 
To strengthen the rare earth leaching process and weaken the hydration of clay minerals for preventing the landslide, it is of great importance to adopt the green and sustainable leaching agent in the industry. In this work, the leaching process of weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores with formate salts (ammonium formate, potassium formate and sodium formate) was investigated.

In-situ leaching. In-situ leaching is also called "solution mining." This process initially involves drilling of holes into the ore deposit. Explosives or hydraulic fracturing are used to create open pathways within the deposit for solution to penetrate into.

## In situ leach
In-situ leaching (ISL), also called in-situ recovery (ISR) or solution mining, is a mining process used to recover minerals such as copper and uranium through boreholes drilled into a deposit, in situ.In situ leach works by artificially dissolving minerals occurring naturally in a solid state. For recovery of material occurring naturally in solution, see: Brine mining.

## In-Situ Leaching & Borehole Mining - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
In Situ Leaching Copper . The leaching portion of the in situ mining program (particularly for copper) is divided into three broad depth ranges: surface, near surface, and deep (fig. 1). Most of the copper ore bodies in the surface category are above the water table, and little, if any, overburden covers the ore.

## Atomistic Insights into Activation and Degradation of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3−δ 
The stability of perovskite oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a critical role in their applicability in water splitting concepts. Decomposition of perovskite oxides under applied potential is typically linked to cation leaching and amorphization of the material. However, structural changes and phase transformations at the catalyst surface were also shown to govern

## CNA - Process method for in-situ leaching injection of ionic 
The invention discloses a process method for in-situ leaching injection of ionic rare earth ore, which comprises the following steps: s1, punching: a plurality of transverse liquid injection holes are drilled at intervals on the side surface of the ionic rare earth ore body, and the transverse liquid injection holes transversely penetrate through the ore body or point to the center of the ore
