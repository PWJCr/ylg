Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

Hematite is also known as "natural ore". The name refers to the early years of mining, when certain hematite ores contained 66% iron and could be fed directly into blast furnaces. Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is one of the main raw materials to make steel. 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.

## Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional 
Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional beneficiation plants The hematite ore (Fe 2 O 3) is always associated with limonite & goethite ores, which cannot be attracted by high gauss magnetic separators in the conventional beneficiation plants. Such tailings have 30-50% left-over Fe, which is a waste of natural resources.

Sep 16, 2022Iron ore beneficiation process is for the processing of iron ore materials, divided into crushing and screening, grinding and classification, sorting and dewatering. Crushing and screening is the crushing and screening of iron ore to ensure that the size of the crushed ore can provide the next process to meet the block size requirements of the ore.
