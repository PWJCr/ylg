## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - How Does It Work
Jaw crushers have two jaws: one remains fixed while the other one moves. The jaw crusher working principle works in the reciprocating movement of your movable jaw. This part crushes and compresses ores and rocks between itself as well as the fixed jaw when you keep feeding the crusher with rocks, stones, and ores.
