## Refractory raw materials processing procedures and broken crushing points
There are usually two types of crushing processes: open flow and closed flow. Open flow advantage is the simple process, refractory raw material only through the grinder once. The disadvantage is the power consumption, low productivity, and produce excessive flour, is not conducive to improving the quality of products.

Refractory manufacturing involves four processes: raw material processing, forming, firing, and final processing. Figure 11.5-1 illustrates the refractory manufacturing process. Raw material processing consists of crushing and grinding raw materials, followed if necessary by size classification and raw materials calcining and drying.

Cold crushing strength: The cold crushing strength is the resistance of the refractory to crushing, which mostly happens during transport. It only has an indirect relevance to refractory performance, and is used as one of the indicators of abrasion resistance. Other indicators used are bulk density and porosity.

## crushing of refractorie raw materials
The Page Description. The Cold Crushing Strength CCS represents the ability of a product to resist failure under compressive load at room temperature It has an indirect relevance to refractory performance, and is used as one of the indicators of abrasion resistance The higher the CCS of a material is the greater should be the resistance to abrasion Refractories with high CCS are also expected
