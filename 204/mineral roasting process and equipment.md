## Roasting (metallurgy)
Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in the presence of air. It is a step in the processing of certain ores.More specifically, roasting is often a metallurgical process involving gas-solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting, the ore has already been partially purified, e.g. by froth

Under the oxidative roasting process, pyrite, as a major mineral in sulfidic mine tailings, can transform to iron oxides. Generated iron oxides, if exhibiting enough magnetic properties, can be recovered via magnetic separation resulting in partial mine tailings valorization.
