## Horizontal Boring Mills - Floor & Table Type Boring Machines | KRC 
The difference between a horizontal boring mill and a vertical boring mill is that a horizontal mill's workpiece is stationary, and the tool turns. A vertical boring mill will have a stationary tool while the workpiece turns. A horizontal boring mill allows for more versatility because the machine tool doesn't limit part sizes.

Jul 24, 2021In short, what truly classifies horizontal and vertical turbines is their orientation relative to the wind. Horizontal turbines spin on an axis that is parallel to the direction of the wind, while vertical turbines are oriented perpendicular to the direction of the wind. Horizontal wind turbines have become the norm over the past few decades.
