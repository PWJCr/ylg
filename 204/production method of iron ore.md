Characterisation of the Physical and Metallurgical Properties of Natural Iron Ore for Iron Production: The blast furnace is still the dominant form of iron production, but over the years, direct reduction methods have increased due to a number of reasons. Overall, iron production methods have optimal requirements with respect to the feed materials especially iron ore.

## Iron Extraction Process - ROGESA
At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.

Mar 15, 2022The iron ore processing and production process refers to the production process in which the mined iron ore must be processed and produced by various operations to obtain concentrates that meet the smelting requirements. Mainly include: ore crusher crushing and vibrating screen screening, ball mill grinding and classifier classification; mineral separation, such as gravity separation
