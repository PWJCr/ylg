## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
The settings on a jaw crusher are designed to produce material ideal for secondary crushing. The best particle shape is typically found in material that is about the same size as the closed-side setting. Smaller sizes will contain a higher proportion of elongated particles because they have passed through the crusher without being touched.
