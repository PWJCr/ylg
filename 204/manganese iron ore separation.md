Nov 28, 2021The ore is first finely processed before being conveyed on a conveyor belt that passes over a magnetic roller. The magnetic ore stays on the belt, while the gangue slides off. By eliminating non-magnetic impurities, this process is utilised to concentrate magnetic ores of iron such as magnetite and chromite and manganese (pyrolusite).
