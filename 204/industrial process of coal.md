## Coal, Steam, and the Industrial Revolution - Khan Academy
So steam engines used cheap British coal to keep British coal cheap, and cheap British coal created the opportunity for everything from railroads to steel, which like so much else in the Industrial Revolution, created a positive feedback loop. Because they run on rails, railroads need steel. And because it is rather heavy, steel needs railroads.

## Coal Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
This can be exemplified by looking at the use of coal as heat supply for space heating and process heat, in the domestic or industrial sectors. For providing heat from coal there exist the routes via electricity production, via gasification and via hydrogenation, and of burning the coal gas or the coal oil at the producers′ end.

After the coal briquettes are produced, you can not pack them or pile them up directly. They should be dried for some time. The process looks very simple, but there are some technical problems that should be payed attention in the

Industrial coal fired boilers adopt a new combustion technology in which crushed and ground coal is injected into the combustion chamber through a combustion nozzle at a certain speed. The whole combustion process takes place in the furnace and takes only about 1 second. Heat transfer and heat exchange are high.

Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

## Coal
The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called coalification.At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. In these wetlands, the process of coalification began when dead plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water, and was converted into peat.This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs
