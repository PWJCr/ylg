## Coal, Steam, and the Industrial Revolution - Khan Academy
So steam engines used cheap British coal to keep British coal cheap, and cheap British coal created the opportunity for everything from railroads to steel, which like so much else in the Industrial Revolution, created a positive feedback loop. Because they run on rails, railroads need steel. And because it is rather heavy, steel needs railroads.

It is also used to enrich air and increase combustion temperatures in blast furnaces as well as to replace coke with other combustible materials such as pulverized coal, fuel oil, or natural gas etc. During the steelmaking process by basic oxygen furnace, unwanted carbon combines with oxygen to form carbon oxides, which leave as gases.

## Coal Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
This can be exemplified by looking at the use of coal as heat supply for space heating and process heat, in the domestic or industrial sectors. For providing heat from coal there exist the routes via electricity production, via gasification and via hydrogenation, and of burning the coal gas or the coal oil at the producersâ€² end.

The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burnt. more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace. The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam.

Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called coalification.At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. In these wetlands, the process of coalification began when dead plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water, and was converted into peat.This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs
