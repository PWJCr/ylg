## FAQ | Blue Rock Quarry
Hard rock quarries are very immune to draining any liquids. This is mainly because hard rock quarries are very solid, much like a plastic bowl.  Minimal water is used in the quarry process and what is used is 90% recycled. Rain water, because it is not absorbed, often is pumped out of quarries and used in the processing.

Rock from the quarry face is fed into the top of the crusher and crushed rock falls out of the bottom of the jaws. The size of the crushed stone which passes through the jaws is partly governed by the gap set at the bottom of the jaws, though larger size rocks can pass through if the rock being crushed is slabby or elongate in shape.
