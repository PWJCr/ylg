Uganda has announced the discovery of a 31 million-tonne gold ore deposit, with extractable pure gold estimated to total 320,000 tonnes. President Museveni announced the discovery in his State-of-the-Nation Address yesterday, but provided little detail, pointing out that the gemstones would fetch the country more than $12 trillion.

## Three gold ore beneficiation technology methods!
1. Gold ore gravity separation technology Gravity separation is a traditional beneficiation technology, which utilizes the difference in density between gold ore and other minerals to separate and enrich gold with higher density from other minerals under the condition of monomer dissociation. Generally used for placer beneficiation.
