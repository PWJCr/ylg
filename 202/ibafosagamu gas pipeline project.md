## CER - Canada's Pipeline System 2021 - Natural Gas Pipeline 
In 2019, Canada was the sixth largest producer of natural gas in the world, accounting for 4.3% of global supply. Footnote 39 Canadian natural gas production averaged 15.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) or 442 million cubic meters per day (10 6 m³/d) in 2019 and 2020, declining 2.7% from 2018, but still sitting 5.0% above 2015 production. The recent decline was driven by a pull-back in
