Vibrating conveyor systems. A Vibrating Conveyor is a machine with a solid conveying surface which is turned up on the side to form a trough. They are used extensively in food grade applications where sanitation, washdown, and low maintenance are essential. Vibrating conveyors are also suitable for harsh, very hot, dirty, or corrosive environments.

Vibrating conveyors are made of an empty tube, or tray, with one inlet and one outlet (sometimes 2 outlets) and a vibrating motor that is creating specific vibration intensity and amplitudes that allow the bulk solid to flow. Vibrating tubes have grown popular in the field of solids handling compared to other solutions, mainly screw conveyors.

A vibrating conveyor is ideally suited to applications with high throughput rates - such as a bulk product transfer - where the conveying velocity is generally fixed. A vibratory conveyor can take the form of open trough, enclosed trough or tube design. Conveyors are driven by singular or twin vibrator motor drives.

The most common vibrating conveyor has an inclined motion--the frequencies of both components are the same, the components are in phase, and the design of the conveyor mounting is simple. The performance of the out-of-phase conveyor will also be analysed, but hopping conveying, where an out-of-phase motion may be advantageous, is not.
