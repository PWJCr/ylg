## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
The raw materials such as limestone or chalk and shale or clay may be mixed either in dry condition or in wet condition. The process is accordingly known as the dry process or the wet process of mixing.  the wet process was used for the manufacture of cement. From 1913 onwards, the cement industry underwent a number of changes mainly to suit

Finally, the cement is packaged in large bags. Cement is one of the four raw materials that are used in the production of concrete, along with gravel, sand and water. To be exact, concrete consists of 50% gravel, 25% sand, 15% cement and 10% water. All four materials are blended together in a rotating machine called a concrete mixer.
