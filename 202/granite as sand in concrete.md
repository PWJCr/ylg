## Importance of Gravel and Sand for Concrete | Hunker
Jun 18, 2022A typical concrete mix contains 60 to 80 percent sand and gravel, also known as an "aggregate." This aggregate compound is more than filler. It plays an important part in the concrete's composition. The amount of sand and gravel in a bag of concrete determines the mixture's strength and texture.

There are many downsides to using unstabilized decomposed granite for a driveway. Without proper stabilization, it is not quite as permeable. It will still drain liquid, but at a much slower rate than if the driveway were to be excavated and stabilized with pavers. Also, it actually encourages weed growth if laid over plain grass.
