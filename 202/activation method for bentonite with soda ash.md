In soda activation, soda ash powder was added to the initially moisturized bentonite samples and kneaded till all the bentonite had reacted with soda. After soda addition and kneading, the activated samples were left to drying/curing under sunlight for a month to complete the activation process ( Harvey and Lagaly, 2006 ).
