iron ore resources have become a national priority. As per the recent national steel policy, our country will be producing about 110 million tons of steel per annum by 2020 requiring around 42 million tons of iron ore. The iron ore exports are projected to a level of 114 million tones and it amounts to total production of 300 million tons by 2020.

Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
