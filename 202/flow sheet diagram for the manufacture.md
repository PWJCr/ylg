## Sodium carbonate manufacturing process, solvay process
Potassium carbonate (K 2 CO 3) cannot be manufactured by solvay process because potassium bicarbonate (KHCO 3) fairly soluble in water. In sodium carbonate manufacturing, first sodium bicarbonate is precipitated, then Na 2 CO 3 is produced. But due to higher solubility of KHCO 3, K 2 CO 3 is unable to manufacture by solvay process.

Let us take a look at the diagram below. As per the diagram, in the Haber process, we take nitrogen gas from the air and combine it with hydrogen atoms obtained from natural gas in the ratio 1:3 by volume. The gases are passed through four beds of catalyst, with cooling taking place in each pass. This is done to maintain equilibrium constant.
