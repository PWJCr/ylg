## Conveyor Belt System Issues :: Good Company Discussions - Steam Community
The first level where you encounter conveyor belts, it is a bit of a mess. It's almost impossible to extend the current belt lines and I find the belt system in general not intuitive. If you drag from the current system in the level is just doesn't connect and also you can't delete the belts that are already in the level. A big problem I have is you can't rotate the conveyor. You have to drag

## Understanding Shaft Alignment Options For Conveyor Drives
Mar 22, 2021This puts the motor alongside the conveyor rather than having it sticking out some distance from the belt. A downside of the alignment-free configuration is that the reducer and motor are suspended from the pulley shaft. Consequently, a suspended load must be taken into account when sizing a pulley shaft appropriately.

The Conveyor Splitter is a logistic structure that takes items from a single input Conveyor Belt or Lift and outputs them between three other belts. The Conveyor Splitter and Conveyor Merger have fairly large collision boxes which are likely to obstruct additional parallel belts. For example, a splitter for Screw belt is likely to block the construction of Iron Plate belt. It is advised to

## Selecting Conveyor Pulleys - KC Supply
When selecting a pulley for a belt conveyor application, a little homework is required. Here are steps that can make your decision easier and more accurate: Determine the face length of the conveyor pulley: The face length of a conveyor pulley is a derivative of the conveyor belt width. In bulk-handling applications, an adequate pulley face
