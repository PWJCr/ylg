The cylinder length-diameter ratio of rod mill is generally 1.5-2.0, while the cylinder length-diameter ratio of ball mill is smaller, only slightly greater than 1. In addition, the cylinder speed of the rod mill is lower than that of the ball mill, so the grinding medium works in the cascading state. 2. Discharging way of ball mill and rod mill,

Rod mills are very similar to ball mills, except they use long rods for grinding media. The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6. Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm

## How HPGRs compare to conventional milling - The Weir Group
HPGR wear vs conventional mills. Ball, SAG and rod mills all require their grinding media to be regularly replaced, unlike a HPGR. High Pressure Grinding Rolls have lower maintenance overheads than ball and rod mills, primarily because the grinding media in conventional mills needs to be replaced on a more regular basis.

The finesse of the material milled by the ball mill is 0.074mm-0.4mm, only except for the two small ball mills that have a wider range of 0.075-0.89mm. However, the rod mill fine grinding fineness is about 0.833-0.147mm. In terms of the fineness of the ground material, the ball mill has a finer handling ability.

Rod mills are used in an open circuit between crushing and the ball mill. They often operate in wet and where the pulp contains up to 50% solid by mass. This machine is equally very applicable to dry where it could take a feed that has achieved 6% moisture. As such, when the product is sticky, rod mills are preferred over ball mills.

## The Difference Between the Ball Mill and Rod Mill | Studymode
The Difference Between the Ball Mill and Rod Mill. Rod mills are very similar to ball mills, except they use long rods for grinding media. The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1

Fig 1 Cross sections of a rod mill and a bar mill. Ball mills. Ball mill (Fig 1) is same kind of mill as rod mill, except that it is filled with balls instead of rods. Because of balls have greater ratio of surface area than rods they are more suitable for fine grinding. Balls are also lighter, so the kinetic energy of a single dropping ball is
