## Settling basin
A settling basin, settling pond or decant pond is an earthen or concrete structure using sedimentation to remove settleable matter and turbidity from wastewater.The basins are used to control water pollution in diverse industries such as agriculture, aquaculture, and mining. Turbidity is an optical property of water caused by scattering of light by material suspended in that water.

## Placer mining wastewater settling pond demonstration project - ARLIS
Description. Summary: A study was conducted on the effectiveness of settling ponds for treatment of effluent water from Alaska placer gold mines. As part of the study, a demonstration settling pond was designed; constructed at an operating mine on Porcupine Creek near Central, Alaska; and monitored for 50 days during the 1981 mining season.

## Nickel mining in Australia - history, top locations and companies - GRT
Feb 15, 2021The rise in nickel mining is attributed to the Kambalda region in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Nickel ore grades in the 1960s had 4% nickel but within a decade the nickel ore grade in Australia fell to 2%. Over the last 20 years, low grade laterite or sulphide deposits have posted an average ore grade of about 1.2%.

Particle Size: ENV recommends that sediment ponds be designed to capture at least a 10 micron soil particle for the 10-year, 24-hour run-off event. Use of Settling Aids: Flocculants can be used to promote the clumping of particles and therefore enhance the effectiveness of a settling pond. However, their use must be specifically authorized.
