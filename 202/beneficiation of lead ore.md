## lead processing | Britannica
lead processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Lead (Pb) is one of the oldest metals known, being one of seven metals used in the ancient world (the others are gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and mercury). Its low melting point of 327 °C (621 °F), coupled with its easy castability and softness and malleability, make lead and lead alloys especially suitable for a wide

## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

Iron ore beneficiation can be brought about through three approaches, namely, selective dissolution, microbially induced flotation, and selective flocculation-dispersion.  This example is an idealized system, however, and in practice, the presence of slimes and various ions in solution will lead to variations to this model flotation behavior.
