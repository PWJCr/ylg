## Evaluation and Risk Analysis of Open-Pit Mining Operations
Mining of raw materials is a process that consists of several stages. In open-pit mining, material with high compressive strength is extracted by drilling and blasting and material with low compressive strength is extracted by e. g. a bucket wheel excavator. Most important influencing factors for crusher decision are compressive strength, moisture content, capacity of crusher, abrasiveness

However, blasting capacity may present upside to the overall capacity of rock breakage and comminution leading to an increase in a mines ore throughput. In some projects reducing the ore top size specification allows an adjustment to the primary crusher setting resulting in an overall crushed product with more fines.

## Mining
Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe.The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron.Other precious metals were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through open-pit mining, and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts.
