## Rapid Sand Filter - Advantages and Disadvantages - LiquiSearch
Advantages include: Much higher flow rate than a slow sand filter; about 150 to 200 million gallons of water per acre per day. Requires relatively small land area. Less sensitive to changes in raw water quality, e.g. turbidity. Requires less quantity of sand. Disadvantages include: Large pore size will not without coagulant or flocculent remove

2. Rapid sand filtration is a technique common in developed countries for treating large quantities of drinking water. It is a relatively sophisticated process usually requiring power-operated pumps for backwashing or cleaning the filter bed, and flow control of the filter outlet. A continuously operating filter will usually require backwashing

In rapid sand filters the loadings typically run as high as 20 gpm/ft 2 (1.4 lps/m 2 ), although one would be very unwise to use such values with raw seawater. More reasonable maximum values would be about a quarter of this number. Their head losses when clean can be in the order of 30-90 ft (9.1-27.4 m).

The main components of a rapid gravity sand filter are the filter media, the gravel support layers and the filter underdrain. The underdrain serves to support the filter medium and gravel; to collect filtered water evenly from the bottom of the filter; and to distribute air and water evenly across the bottom of the filter during backwashing.

## How to Differentiate Between Rapid Gravity Filters and Slow Sand 
The sand is supported by the gravel base. It ranges from 0.3 to 0.75 m in depth and 3 to 65 mm in size. 3. Filter sand. The effective size varies from 0.35 mm to 0.55 mm and the uniformity coefficient is between 1.2 to 1.8. The effective size varies from 0.2 mm to 0.4 mm and the uniformity coefficient is between 1.8 to 3.

## In comparing slow sand filters (SSF) and rapid sand filters (RSF)
Difference between SSF and RSF: Coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation is the must. C u ⇒ 1.8 to 3. Large such as 30m × 60 m. An area from m 2. Small 5m × 8m. Very efficient in removing bacteria but less efficient in removing colour. Less efficient in bacteria (80-90%), very efficient in colour removal.
