Unlike other popular countertop materials like granite, Silestone doesn't need to be sealed or resealed, and unlike Corian, will never need to be re-sanded because of cuts or nicks. Also, because Silestone is primarily Quartz and naturally provides a glossy sheen, it won't need frequent polishing. 5. Extremely Durable. Silestone offers you the possibility of two different formats: the standard

## Manufacturing Process of Marble used for House Finishing Works
Polishers grind down the naturally rough surface of the stone to multiple finishes the consumer desires. Hard stones like marble and granite can be polished all the way to a mirror finish. The polisher consists of rotating pads which are textured with an abrasive material. The finer and smaller the abrasive grits are, the higher the polish.
