## Copper Dissoliution in Concentrated Sulfuric Acid
1. Introduction. Since mineral or inorganic acids (sulfuric H 2 SO 4 and nitric HNO 3) are the most frequently used chemicals in research and industry, one of the most important issues is the interaction of metals with solutions of strong acids.Students have serious difficulties when studying different chemistry sections, especially the one related to redox reactions.

• Sulfuric acid can create a highly flammable hydrogen gas if it is spilled on metals. • Skin and other bodily burns from sulfuric acid can be more serious than burns from other strong acids . Sulfuric acid dehydrates whatever it touches, and the heat caused by that reaction with water can create secondary thermal damage.

## How does copper oxide and sulphuric acid react to eachother?
Copper (II) oxide, is a black solid, which, when reacted with sulphuric acid creates a cyan-blue coloured chemical called copper II sulfate. Copper (II) oxide reacts with sulfuric acid to create water and copper (II) sulfate. This reaction could be classified as a double displacement reaction or a neutralization reaction.

## Does copper react with acids?etta.ca
Cu(OH) 2 (s) --> CuO (s) + H 2 O (l) Copper oxide dissolves in acid, regenerating the copper (II) ion, which once again binds to water.  Does acid dissolve copper? Sulfuric acid has a medium oxidizing ability and will dissolve copper over time. With a high oxidative strength, nitric acid will completely dissolve copper, turning it green and

## Copper oxide and hydrogen experiment-des-ostens
The non-metals hydrogen and carbon are often included in the reactivity series, and this quite important when considering the method by which a metal can be extracted from its ore. You should also note that a more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from one of its compounds.
