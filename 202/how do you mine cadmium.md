## Cadmium facts: Are You Being Exposed to Cadmium - Doctors Health Press
Scientific evidence strongly shows that cadmium is a major human toxicant, meaning that it's toxic to our bodies. Cadmium is used in metal alloys to increase strength and wear resistance, or to lower the melting point. Cadmium pigments are used to create bright yellow, orange, red, and maroon dyes, paints, plastics, and ceramics.

Overview. Cadmium (Cd) is a soft, malleable, bluish white metal found in zinc ores, and to a much lesser extent, in the cadmium mineral greenockite. Most of the cadmium produced today is obtained from zinc byproducts and recovered from spent nickel-cadmium batteries. First discovered in Germany in 1817, cadmium found early use as a pigment

## Cadmium | SA Health
Cadmium is not required for any normal bodily function. Cadmium exerts toxic effects on the kidney, the skeletal system and the respiratory system and is classified as a human carcinogen. The human body can only get rid of cadmium slowly and this can result in a build-up of cadmium in the body primarily in the kidneys and the liver.
