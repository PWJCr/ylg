## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
Jul 20, 2022Jaw crusher machine installation cost is relatively higher than gyratory crusher while its investment and maintenance cost is much lower than that of gyratory crusher.  Both are used in the secondary or tertiary crushing process but still have many differences. Roll crushers reduce material by force generated from two relatively rotating drums.

## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing?
The degree to which material is reduced through stages of primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing can depend on the type of material, like aggregate, concrete, and asphalt, and can also depend on the variety of output sizes needing produced. Primary crushing is the first stage of material reduction and can sometimes be the only stage needed
