## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
F.M of Ideal fine aggregate for concrete applications are in range of 2.6 to 2.9. Fine sand (lower F.M Value ) reduces the sand requirement % in the total aggregate proportion. On the other hand, coarser sand will require higher sand % in the total aggregate proportion to give a cohesive concrete mix consuming least cement.

## Importance of Gravel and Sand for Concrete | Hunker
Jun 18, 2022Smaller gravel particles equals a "fine" grade of concrete. Use the fine aggregate for concrete slabs or other smooth surfaces. A "coarse" aggregate means using larger pieces of gravel. Coarse concrete is helpful for sturdier projects. Concrete with a coarse aggregate doesn't produce a smooth look or feel but is stronger than a finer grade.
