## Extraction of antimony trioxide from antimony sulfide ore
Disclosed is a process for extracting antimony trioxide from antimony sulfide ore concentrate by solubility differential of the trioxide in lower alkanol solutions of sodium or potassium hydroxide and wherein the total amount of water contained in the concentrate, the alkanol and the hydroxide is not more than 26.52 volume percent of the antimony sulfide content; which process includes
