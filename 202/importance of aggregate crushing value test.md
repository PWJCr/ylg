(Alan) Impact value of an aggregate is the percentage loss of weight particles passing2.36mm sieve by the application of load by means of 15 blows of standard hammer and drop,under specified test condition. The aggregate impact value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to sudden shock or impact, which in some aggregates differs from their resistance to a slowly applied

## Exp 4 Aggregate Impact Value - Civil Engineers PK
Aggregate Impact Value. The test sample shall consist of aggregates the whole of which passes through ½ in B.S. test sieve and is retained on a 3/8 in B.S. test sieve. The aggregate comprising the test sample shall be dried in an oven for a period of four hours at a temperature of °C and cooled.The measuring cup shall be filled about

## What is the significance of ten percent fines value in testing sub-base 
The test aims at looking for the forces required to produce 10% of fine values (i.e. weight of fines aggregates/weight of all aggregates = 10%). This test is very similar to Aggregate Crushing Test in which a standard force 400kN is applied and fines material expressed as a percentage of the original mass is the aggregate crushing value.
