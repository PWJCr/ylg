A few years ago, while mining, the goblins discovered their mountain sat on a highly valuable hot salt vein and spring. Applying a little goblin ingenuity and goblin Rube Goldberg-like mechanical engineering, they extracted the salt slurry into a high-grade and highly valuable salt production line. Even goblins need salt to preserve food.

## What is Multiplexer?
Jul 24, 2021More Detail. A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that obtains binary data from one of 2" input data lines and manages it to an individual output line. The selection of a specific input data line for the output is decided by a collection of selection inputs. A 2"-to-1 multiplexer has 2" input data lines and n input selection lines whose bit

## TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer Module - with Arduino and NodeMCU
The multiplexer supports both normal (100 kHz) and fast (400 kHz) I2C protocols. All I/O pins of TCA9548A are 5-volt tolerant and can also be used to translate from high to low or low to high voltages. It is a good idea to put pull-up resistors on all channels of TCA9548A, even if the voltages are the same.
