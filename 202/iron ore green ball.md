Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Iron Ore is Lead Ore, which will sometimes replace Iron in a world.

## Iron ore quality a potential headwind to green steelmaking - IEEFA
Jun 28, 2022Another factor has received less attention. DRI steelmaking requires a higher grade of iron ore than blast furnaces, the dominant global process. DR-grade iron ore ideally has an iron (Fe) content of 67% or more and such deposits are scarce --only a small percentage of global seaborne iron ore comes close to DR-grade.
