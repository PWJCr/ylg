alternative to natural sand. The more consumption of natural sand also causes an ecological change to our environment. Unavailability and shortage of natural sand can also be balanced by using crushed stone. Manufactured sand is also known as crushed sand and stone dust and it is made by crushing and grading suitable granite stones and rocks.

## Difference Between Artificial Sand And Natural Sand - Gravel Mill
Artificial Sand vs. Natural Sand. Manufactured in factory. Naturally available on river banks. The shape of crushed sand is cubical and angular and has a rough texture and hence better for concrete. Smoother texture with better shape. Demands less water. Higher concrete strength compared to river sand used for concreting.

Let's discuss about the properties and applications of manufactured sand comparing with Natural sand. 1. Sourcing: Natural sand is sourced from river beds. Process.

## Suitability of Crushed Manufactured Sand for Replacement of Natural 
Sep 3, 2021The global consumption of natural sand is very high, due to the extensive use of concrete or mortar. The fine and coarse aggregates generally occupy 60% to 75% concrete volume (70% to 85% by mass

## Which is better m sand or river sand?hcharge
Crushed sand can be of coarser and angular texture. This can lead to more water and cement requirement to achieve the expected workability. Manufactured sand can contain larger amounts of micro fine particles than natural sand, This can affect the strength and workability of the concrete.

## Manufactured Sand vs. Natural Sand - Chaney Enterprises
Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical. Spherical particles decrease the percentage of voids within the concrete mixture so no additional paste is required to fill these voids. Well-shaped natural sands are ideal for workability of mixtures.
