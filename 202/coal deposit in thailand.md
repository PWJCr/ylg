## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

Sub bituminous coal has a heating value between 8300 and 13000 British Thermal Units per pound on a mineral-matter-free basis. On the basis of heating value, it is subdivided into sub bituminous A, sub bituminous B, and sub bituminous C ranks. Bituminous. Bituminous is the most abundant rank of coal.
