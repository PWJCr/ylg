## Microwave-assisted self-reduction of EAF dust-biochar composite 
The direct reduced iron was obtained by magnetic separation of reduced briquettes. Abstract This study applied microwave energy for rapid self-reduction of electric arc furnace (EAF) dust-biochar composite briquettes to produce powdered direct reduced iron (DRI), based on the good electromagnetic response of EAF dust-biochar composite briquettes.

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

## Direct reduced iron - newbridgegate
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Reduced iron derives its name from the chemical change that iron ore undergoes when it is heated in a furnace at a high

## Direct Reduced Iron - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), also known as Sponge Iron, offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI, iron ore is reduced in its solid state - unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East, South America, India and Mexico.

Basic characteristics of Direct reduced iron (DRI) 1. Stable chemical composition can effectively dilute the residuals and metal elements in steel thus improve the steel quality. 2. Low content of harmful elements, such as P and s and it can shorten refining time. 3.

## Direct reduced iron plant - Global Energy Monitor
Mar 30, 2022Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, and/or fines) into iron with a sponge-like exterior, without melting. The heart of the direct reduction is the shaft furnace, which is filled from the top with lump ore and pellets. DRI production turns iron ore into iron using gaseous reducing agents such as
