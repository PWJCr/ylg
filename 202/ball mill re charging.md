5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium

## Keeping an eye out for grinding mill dropped charge and two ways to 
To help the grinding process, water and steel balls are added to the process which then form the charge in the mill. Ball mill charge contains a significant amount of steel balls and can become extremely heavy. For example, a large 24 foot (7.3 m) diameter ball mill charge typically weighs around 2 million lbs (907 tons).

A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

The ball charge and ore charge volume is a variable, subject to what is the target for that operation. The type of mill also is a factor as if it is an overflow mill (subject to the diameter of the discharge port) is usually up to about 40-45%. If it is a grate discharge you will have more flexibility of the total charge.
