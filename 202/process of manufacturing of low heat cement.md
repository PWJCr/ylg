Raw Materials of Cement. Most important raw materials (what is cement made of) required in the manufacture of Portland Cement are: Limestone, Clay, Gypsum, Fuel, and Water (in wet method). 1. Limestones: These are sedimentary, calcium carbonate rocks (CaC0 3 ). Most commonly they contain a small amount of magnesium carbonate also.

## Cement
The overall process is responsible for about 8% of global CO 2 emissions, as the cement kiln in which the reaction occurs is typically fired by coal or petroleum coke due to the luminous flame required to heat the kiln by radiant heat transfer. As a result, the production of cement is a major contributor to climate change

## how the low heat cement process
In fact, the whole point behind the high-temperature cement manufacturing process is to create solid phases that will readily dissolve in water, allowing new phases to form. When one phase is converted into another phase with a lower free energy, there is usually a release of excess energy in the form of heat.

During normal production process, the clinker is always calcined in a fixed temperature range. According to the fluctuation of raw meal composition, the calcination temperature of clinker is generally between 1350℃ and 1450℃. If the temperature in the kiln is too low, it is easy to produce underfired clinker.

Product Description. Low Heat Cement (IS 12600 -1989) Cement hydration is an exothermic reaction and results in evolution of heat. Whenever cement is used for mass concreting works, because of heat generated during hydration, temperature gradients form between the core & surface of the structure. This temperature gradient results in thermal

This makes concrete much stronger than grout, but also limits where you can use it. You can't use concrete in tight gaps because the stone gets in the way, but grout works great when laid thin. Grout is stickier and better at binding materials together, but concrete is. In construction, self-leveling underlayments are essential to a floor's strength and stability.

Cement is a hydraulic binder, i.e. it hardens when water is added. There are 27 types of common cement which can be grouped into 5 general categories and 3 strength classes: ordinary, high and very high. In addition, some special cements exist like sulphate resisting cement, low heat cement and calcium aluminate cement.

## how the low heat cement process
process of manufacturing of low heat cement. At low heat of hydration cement is made by decreasing both C3S and C3A High amounts of C3A due to its high reaction speed and exothermic reaction decreases the setting time of the slurry Hydration of cement gives off considerable heat about 80 calories per gram of cement 80 BTU/lb Maximum release of heat is obtained about 4 to 6 hours after
