There are several ways in which this gold could be collected, and a few companies have trials underway. Distillation would be one method - basically distilling seawater and refining the residue. This is uneconomic as the energy required to boil off the water is considerable, though potentially a product of desalination plants with added stages.

May 20, 2022Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

##  Processing technologies for gold-telluride ores
The presence of gold telluride minerals may render an ore refractory, the extent of this depends on the telluride mineral present and the mineralogical association [3]. Gold, silver, and gold/silver-telluride minerals in ores dissolve more slowly than native gold in cyanide solutions, which results in less efficient gold extraction [4].
