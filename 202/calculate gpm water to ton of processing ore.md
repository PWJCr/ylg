## Calculate Tonnage of chilled water made - HVAC-Talk: Heating, Air 
Each chiller is designed to deliver chilled water at a certain flow rate with a certain temperature difference. Tonnage is calculated as follows: GPM x ∆ T︒ ÷ 24. For example, if the chiller has a flow rate of 550 GPM and the Delta T is 4.8〫F, then the tonnage would be 110 Tons.

The GPM formula is 60 divided by the number of seconds it takes to fill a one gallon container. So if you took 10 seconds to fill a gallon container, your GPM measurement would be 6 GPM (60/10 seconds = 6 GPM). To most accurately calculate GPM, you use the pressure tank method and formula.

Nov 07, 2018· The actual tonnage for a (nominal) "10 ton" chiller can vary from four tons all the way up to 12 tons based on those pesky design conditions. You see "nominal tons" are typically calculated at ARI conditions, which is 44°F leaving water temperature, 54°F entering water temperature, and 95°F ambient temperature. What's that?

Open loop and closed loop doesnt matters, GPM is estimated only by demand required or how much flowrate required where it is applied.

## How to Calculate Water System BTU Measurements
Calculate System Delivered BTU. To find the system-delivered BTU, multiply the BTU multiplier of 500 x the estimated Pump GPM x the System Temperature Change. Example: Say you calculate the pump pressure at 5.4 feet of head. Using the pump curve you plot and find the Taco 007 Pump is moving 5.4 GPM.
