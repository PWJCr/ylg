Artificial sand, also called crushed sand or mechanical sand (m sand), refers to rocks, mine tailings or industrial waste granules with a particle size of less than 4.75 mm. It is processed by mechanical crushing and sieving. In China, the artificial sand was mainly used in the construction of hydropower systems.

## Replacing natural sand by crushed rock in concrete using nonlinear 
There is a lot of pressure to stop using natural sand and instead use crushed rock or recycled aggregate in concretes. However, crushed rock tends to have sharp corners, which affect not only the rheology of fresh concrete, but they also affect the strength of hardened concrete. So it is not possible to add large amounts of crushed rock easily.

## A Review on the Usage of Recycled Sand in the Construction Industry
American Foundry Society [ 5] reported that 100 million tons of sand are using and reusing in foundries per annum in the United States itself. The sand from industrial wastes can be recycled for applications in civil engineering and is called "used foundry sand," "waste foundry sand," or "spent foundry sand.".
