## use of coal in cement making
Cement Wikipedia. The most common use for Portland cement is to make concrete. Concrete is a composite material made of aggregate (gravel and sand), cement, and water. As a construction material, concrete can be cast in almost any shape, and once it hardens, can be a structural (load bearing) element. Portland cement may be grey or white.

## Effects of Coal Gangue on Cement Grouting Material Properties
The use of coal gangue in the production of cement grouting material comforms to the basic state policy of environment protection and the circular using of natural resources. Through coal gangue processing experiment, coal gangue cement grouting materials making test, properties detection of properties and theoretical analysis, the paper

## coal used in cement
London coal gas production began in 1813 and by 1842 was producing 300,000 tons of coke a year, so coke was also readily available, and, being essentially a waste product, was cheaper than coal. Early cement plants used coal for drying slurry and for power generation, and coke for kiln burning. Per tonne of clinker
