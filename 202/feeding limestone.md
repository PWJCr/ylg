## Broiler Poultry Feed Cost Optimization Using Linear Programming 
The calcium supplements commonly used in poultry feeding are limestone, crushed sea shells, or sea-shell flour. Limestone powder can be included at no more than 3 percent, because higher levels will lower feed intake. To meet the phosphorus needs of poultry, formulations must be supplemented with inorganic phosphorus sources.
