## 2.6 - Weathering Process Activity | Soil Genesis and Development 
The carbonation process dissolves calcite and releases calcium. CaCO3 + H2CO3 = Ca2+ + 2HCO3-The calcium is removed by water carrying it away (leaching). The process is accelerated, since the temperature of the area is high and water is plentiful. The quartz, if present in the limestone, will not break down because of its resistance to weathering.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

## How does weathering affect limestone? - Internet Geography
Aug 15, 2022Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical, chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater, which contains a weak carbonic acid, reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

## How Does Chemical Limestone Form - Realonomics
How is limestone formed and where is it found? Most fresh water and sea water contain dissolved calcium carbonate. All limestones are formed when the calcium carbonate crystallizes out of solution or from the skeletons of small sea urchins and coral. .Such evaporation takes place in the hot lagoons of many coral reefs and in most shallow tropical seas.
