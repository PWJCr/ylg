## conecrusheroptimization
New developments in cone crusher performance optimization. Crusher design evolutionCompression cone crusher designs today have evolved from the simple cone crusher first developed in the mid-1920s by Edgar B., to the modern high performance crushers. Early crushers used springs for tramp iron protection and were manually adjusted.

Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

Educational Resources. Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of the work done by a machine to the energy supplied to it. To apply what this means to your crusher, in your reduction process you are producing exactly the sizes your market is demanding. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products up to 40 mm in size.
