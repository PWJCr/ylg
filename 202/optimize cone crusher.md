## conecrusheroptimization
New developments in cone crusher performance optimization. Crusher design evolutionCompression cone crusher designs today have evolved from the simple cone crusher first developed in the mid-1920s by Edgar B., to the modern high performance crushers. Early crushers used springs for tramp iron protection and were manually adjusted.

Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.
