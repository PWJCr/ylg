Aug 29, 2022Ores found on the earth contains many impurities like sand, rocks, and grit in them, which are collectively known as "Gangue".The concentration of ore is a method of removing gangue particles or other impurities in order to purify the ore. This process is also called Ore-dressing and benefaction.It is a very crucial step to obtain a pure metal from ore and to extract the metal.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

Answer: Iron ore concentrated before putting it into blast furnace . Firstly by washing with water, clay and sand impurities removed thus ore become concentrated . Then calcination is a process which involves heating up the ore with exess air to remove the gasious impurities . Answered by: Uma N. from Vijayawada.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black
