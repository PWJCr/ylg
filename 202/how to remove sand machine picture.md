The Sandblasting process. In detail, sandblasting is a process that allows you to smooth, polish and clean the surface of a material by eroding the surface layer. This mechanical process is carried out by abrasion caused by a jet of air and sand which must then be removed by suction and in some cases could be reused in the next process.
