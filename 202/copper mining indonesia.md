## Cobalt mining environmental impact-bremen
Mining for Cobalt, Lithium, and Nickel creates acid mine drainage which can toxify clean water sources and lead to soil degradation. The production of Lithium Ion batteries requires vast water usage which is problematic considering much of the mining operations occur in dry regions that already struggle with water supplies.

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.
