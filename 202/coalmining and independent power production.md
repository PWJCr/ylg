##  The Production of Electricity Power from Coal - University of Washington
Water is fundamental to burning coal for power as it is heated into steam and used to turn the turbines that generate electricity. Water is withdrawn to support the electricity production cycle and consumed through evaporation. How much is withdrawn (overall) and how much is consumed depends on the cooling technology in a coal-based power plant.

## Independent Power Producers | IPP - Clarke Energy
Independent power producers. Independent power producers (IPPs) are non-utility generators (NUGs) that are typically not owned by the national electricity company or public utility. IPPs generate electricity for sale to the national electricity network. They can also sell power to a single third-party via customer via a power purchase agreement

COAL, PRODUCTION OF GEOLOGY OF COAL. Coal is a fossil fuelâ€”an energy source whose beginnings can be traced to once-living organic materials. It is a combustible mineral, formed from the remains of trees, ferns, and other plants that existed and died in the tropical forests 400 million to 1 billion years ago. Over vast spans of time, heat and pressure from Earth's geological processes

Two dominant methods account for the vast majority of underground coal mining: "room and pillar" and "longwall" mining.. In room and pillar mining, seams of coal are partially mined, leaving large pillars of coal intact to support the overlying layers of rock. When finished, miners practice "retreat" mining, extracting as much coal as possible from the remaining pillars as they

The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years, with early mines documented in ancient China, the Roman Empire and other early historical economies. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today
