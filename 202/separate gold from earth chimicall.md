## what chemical can separate gold from gold dust
Submerge the unrefined gold in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids. This method will dissolve the ore and separate the gold from the impurities, which can later be washed away. The remaining substances will be just water and gold, the latter having a purity level of more than 99.99 percent. Dry this residue until only gold powder remains.

The gold thus obtained is usually of a fineness of about 997 or 998, the remainder being chiefly silver, which would not pay for extraction although part of it could be separated with a further expenditure of time, fuel, and acid. The gold is pressed by a hydraulic ram, the pressure exerted being about 800 lbs. to the square inch.
