## Molybdenum alloying in cast iron and steel | SpringerLink
Molybdenum is primarily used to stabilize the austenite during cooling after solidification and to prevent the formation of pearlite, similar as in the processing of ADI. Molybdenum has little effect on the martensite start (M s) temperature, compared with other elements that tend to decrease the M s temperature and over-stabilize the austenite
