In this example, 225 cubic feet (6.37 cubic meters) divided by 27 is equal to 8.33. You have 8.33 cubic yards (6.37 cubic meters) of concrete that will be poured in this example. Finally, convert your cubic yards to cubic meters

So you have to divide 320 by 4, which equals 80. It is the number of slots for reinforcement across your foundation. If your footings are 16 inches thick, multiply 16 by 80. You will get 1,280 inches or 106.6 feet of rebar. In total, your foundation will require 746.6 feet of rebar.

For concrete, the procedure for volume is as follows: length x width x thickness. You need to divide the total cubic yards that the yield needs to determine the number of concrete bags you need. Use the following yields per each bag size: 40-pound bag yields .011 cubic yards. 60-pound bag yields .017 cubic yards.

Calculation of volume of concrete for beams:-. Beams are generally in a rectangular shape, to calculate the volume of concrete required for beams calculate the top or bottom surface area of the beam and multiply with the depth of beams. Volume of concrete for rectangular beam = Surface area x Depth = length x width x depth = 4×0.5×0.4=0.8m 3.

Apr 22, 2022Just divide the total weight needed by the weight in each bag. Example: The coop slab needs 6,666 pounds of dry concrete. You found a good price on palletized 80-pound bags of fast-mix concrete. Dividing 6,666 by 80 produces the rounded up number of 84. So, for the slab, you need 84 bags (or two pallets) of 80-pound concrete.

## How to Calculate Concrete Formula | eHow
You can calculate the amount of concrete you need by employing a mathematical formula. Advertisement Step 1 Know that the formula for calculating concrete consists of the following: ((length x width x height)/27) x 1.05 = Total concrete needed plus 5 percent extra. The length, width and height are measured in feet.

1 cubic meter (1m3) can be visualised by drawing a cube 1 meter wide x 1 meter tall x 1 meter depth. To calculate the concrete volume of a concrete slab you multiply the length, width and depth of the concrete slab to get an estimate of the amount of concrete you need in cubic metres m3.

2 days agoExample for concrete calculator in Yards, Here, I want to show you a calculation for a 20' by 20' and 3'' thickness concrete slab. 1 . 20×20 = 400 square feet. 2 . 3/12 = 0.25 feet. 3 . 400x 0.25 = 100 cubic feet. 4 . 100 x 0.037 = 3.7 cubic yards. The above example is solving for volume in yards.
