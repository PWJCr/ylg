Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is, to a great extent, a poverty-driven industry. In 1999, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that approximately 13 million people are directly involved in artisanal and small-scale mining,1 including many women and children. Indirectly, another 80 to 100

For Tanzania, peaceful co-existence of large and small scale miners is critical to the economic growth of the country. Revenues from the extractive industry in Tanzania have quadrupled recently to $468.2m in 2012 from $102.1m in 2009. A full 80% of Tanzania's extractive revenues come from mining.

Artisan and small-scale mining (ASM) plays an important role in employment and livelihoods in Tanzania. Estimates suggest that over 1,000,000 Tanzanians are engaged in mining, more than 90 percent of whom are in ASM.
