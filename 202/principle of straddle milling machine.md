Milling Machine Definition: The milling machine is a type of machine which removes the material from the workpiece by feeding the work past a rotating multipoint cutter.The metal removal rate is higher very high as the cutter has a high speed and many cutting edges. It is the most important machine in the tool room as nearly all the operations can be performed on it with high accuracy.
