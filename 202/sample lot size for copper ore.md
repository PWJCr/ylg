## How to determine the Lot Size for the OQ Sampling Plan
Ok I know there is no relationship between sample size and lot size. But there are a lot of recommendations to use at least a sample size of 59 because of statistic evidence. I am preparing a rational who the recommendation of a attributive sample test is recommended on the base of 95% reliance and 95% confidence using a binomial distribution.

Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to

## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

Carefully-conducted experiments have shown that the difference in loss of moisture between the two routes does not exceed 10 per cent, in summer and 7 per cent, in winter. For instance, a lot of ore shipped during the summer months, in which the machine-sample showed 5 per cent, of moisture, would have an actual moisture-content of 5.5 per cent.
