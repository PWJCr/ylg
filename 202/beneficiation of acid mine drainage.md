PDF | Pollution of water resources by acid mine drainage (AMD) has been an issue of primary concern in recent decades. This is rooted to the fact that AMD negatively affects the environment and its suitability to foster life. As such, efforts to recover, valorise and beneficiate minerals acquired from AMD treatment process have been ongoing, albeit with minimal success.

## Acid mine drainage | U.S. Geological Survey
July 1, 2016. Acid mine drainage (AMD) consists of metal-laden solutions produced by the oxidative dissolution of iron sulfide minerals exposed to air, moisture, and acidophilic microbes during the mining of coal and metal deposits. The pH of AMD is usually in the range of 2-6, but mine-impacted waters at circumneutral pH (5-8) are also common.

Treatment of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) from Coal Mines in. The Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) from an extinct coal mine was treated by the lamellar settler (LS) and the treated water was characterized for its quality in terms of inorganic or organic elements, suspended and dissolved solids, among others, to determine its usability for recycling.

## Acid Mine Drainage - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Acid mine drainage (AMD) is the runoff produced when water comes in contact with exposed rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals that react with water and air to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. This acidic run-off dissolves heavy metals including copper, lead, and mercury which pollute ground and surface water.

## Acid Mine Drainage: Sources, Impacts and Prevention - Biotech Articles
Acid mine drainage (AMD) is acidic water having pH of less than 5, and also containing iron, sulfate and other metals which are formed under natural conditions when hardrock mines containing pyrite are exposed to the atmosphere or oxidizing environments. In other words, AMD can also be stated as outflow of the acidic water from mining sites.

## Acid Mine Drainage - effects, types, plants, marine, oxygen
Acid mine drainage (AMD) is produced by the chemical reaction of sulfide ore and associated minerals with air and water. This reaction (as shown below) illustrates how sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) and iron sulfate (FeSO 4 ) are produced when the iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS 2 ) reacts with water: FeS 2 + H 2 O + 3.5O 2 = H 2 SO 4 + FeSO 4.

## What can be done to prevent or clean up acid mine drainage?
Water flowing through active or abandoned mine sites can become polluted by the material being mined[1]. By far the most common mine drainage problem is that of acid mine drainage (AMD). Sulfuric acid is produced when water interacts with sulfur-bearing materials in the presence of oxygen and common bacteria[1]. The acidic water formed by this process can dissolve many metals in bioavailable
