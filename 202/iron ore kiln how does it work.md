## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters. The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
The various advantages of iron ore pellets are given below. Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production. Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

The plant took iron ore concentrate and produced superior iron ore pellets (which are spheres of high iron content and uniform quality) for blast furnace and direct reduced iron feed. Since then, Grate-Kiln systems have been used for over 50 plants, on both magnetite and hematite ores, with an installed capacity of over 115 million tpy.
