## Impact of Mining On The Environment
The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine employees and often vegetation farms are abolished.

## Understanding the impact of deep-sea mining - MIT News
Polymetallic nodules containing minerals essential to energy storage lie at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. In deep-sea mining, a collector vehicle is sent to pick up these nodules from the deep seabed. The vehicle creates a sediment cloud known as a 'collector plume,' seen here in the foreground, that is then carried away by ocean currents.
