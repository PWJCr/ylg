I was able to dump my broken driveway for a fee and pick up free aggregate base rock at the same time. Their fees for drain rock was very reasonable as well.

Reusing concrete can help reduce construction costs, since it saves the cost of transporting concrete to the landfill, which is around $0.25/ton/mile. Recycling also eliminates disposal costs, while reducing the environmental impact of the project. Concrete that is recycled will not end up in landfills and can also replace raw materials.
