Each process relies on the initial grinding of the gold ore, and more than one process may be used on the same batch of gold ore. Mining 1 In lode or vein deposits, the gold is mixed with another mineral, often quartz, in a vein that has filled a split in the surrounding rocks.  Two other methods of gold refining are amalgamotion and smelting.

## Gold Ore Crushing Process and Gold Crusher
Currently,the gold ore processing methods are as follows: First of all, send the large gold ore to jaw crusher evenly and continuously for primary crushing by vibrating feeder. And then, transport the crushed gold ore to cone crusher for secondary crushing. Then, we need to use a vibrating screen to separate the gold ore into different sizes.

For most small-scale gold prospectors, crushing ore to determine the amount of free gold is the best method to determine gold content within an ore sample. Free gold can then be collected using traditional gravity based methods, which do not require the same level of permitting as the chemical methods used by commercial gold mines.

Due to its special nature, gold serves the dual function of commodity and currency. With the increasing depletion of high-grade gold ore reserves, the selection of medium and low-grade refractory gold ore has become the mainstream trend. Although gold has high mining value, its beneficiation technology is relatively complex, and the beneficiation technology methods are also different.
