## Smelting Cranes and Equipment - American Crane
The smelting process is a crucial part of copper, nickel, lead, silver, and iron production; most of these ores begin with impurities present and must be processed prior to industrial use. The metal ore, once heated with chemical reducing agents, is split to separate waste elements from elemental metals, which are then refined and used.

## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.
