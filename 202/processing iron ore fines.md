## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
It is an agglomerating process of converting iron ore fines into 'uniformed sized iron ore pellets' which can be charged directly into a blast furnace (BF) or into a vertical furnace or rotary kiln normally used for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI). The iron ore pellets are shown in Fig 1.

##  Advances in Low Grade Iron Ore Beneficiation - MECON
iron ore is expected to rise by more than 200 million tonne per year to meet the internal demand & export. This additional requirement of iron ore will need beneficiation of low grade ore/fines to get the major portion of increased demand. This paper deals in brief to use of available methodologies for beneficiation of iron ore in Indian context.

## The Introduction to Iron Ore Fines
Iron ore fines is a kind of ore fines which is made from iron ore (ore containing iron elements or iron compounds) through processing, such as ore processing, crushing, sorting, and grinding. The types of iron ore fines are mainly divided into magnetite fines, hematite fines, limonite fines, siderite iron silicate fines and sulfide iron ore.

The iron ore goes through two steps, the grinding process, and the separation process.

## The case for wet processing iron ore - HAVER Australia
For a high-grade iron ore deposit, that is, greater than 62 per cent, a dry crushing and sizing process is sufficient to achieve the required product quality and size fraction as lump ore, sponge ore or sinter fines. Other deposits with lower ore quality, less than 58 per cent, could use selective mining and blending methods to achieve

## sintering process of iron ore fines
The Page Description. Feb 16, 2017 0183 32 ABSTRACTSintering is a thermal agglomeration process that is applied to a mixture of iron ore fines, recycled ironmaking products, fluxes, slag-forming agents, and solid fuel coke The purpose of the sintering process is manufacturing a product with the suitable characteristics thermal, mechanical, physical and chemical to be fed to the blast furnace

## Upgradation of Iron Ore Fines and Slime by Selective  - Hindawi
Mar 4, 2022The iron ore fines and slime having an alumina-to-silica ratio typically >1 create severe operational problems during sintering and subsequent smelting in the blast furnace. Generally, higher alumina content in iron ore fines causes higher viscous slag throughout the smelting process, which in turn requires a high coke rate.
