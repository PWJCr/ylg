## What You Need to Know About Building Trails with Crusher Fines
The crusher fines should be spread to a depth necessary to meet the desired compacted crusher fine thickness. (For example, spread 7" to 8" deep to get a 5" compacted depth) After initial smoothing and compacting, the trail edges are back-filled and dressed smooth. Finally, the trail surface is re-compacted with rollers or vibratory compactors.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
