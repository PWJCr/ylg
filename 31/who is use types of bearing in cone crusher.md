## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Some cone crushers use bushings while others use bearings. Bearing cone crushers tend to run cooler and are more efficient than bushing crushers, and they allow the user to apply more horsepower during crushing without generating excessive heat. Bushing cones create more heat and require lots of lubricating oil and more active cooling systems.
