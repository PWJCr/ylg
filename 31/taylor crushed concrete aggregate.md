## Can You Use Old Concrete As Fill for New Concrete? - Your Own Architect
The answer is YES! If you have a large pile of leftover material from your last project, recycling it into your next one is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly. You can use old concrete as fill for new concrete to create aggregate to add bulk, compressive strength, and stability, as well as for recycling purposes.

## Drainage Aggregates | Scoria and Crushed Concrete
The drainage aggregate called Scoria is a type of igneous rock formed under pressure during the formation of volcanic cones. It is therefore extremely hard and durable yet very porous, so it drains water from surface soils extremely well.

## Concrete Aggregate
Practical information . Optimum grain shape, crushed/round: Cubic/spherical shapes have proved more suitable than linear forms, which can affect the consistence.Crushed aggregate has a slightly higher water requirement for the same consistence because of its larger specific surface area, but higher concrete compressive and particularly tensile strengths can be obtained due to better interlocking.

As a structural material, recycled concrete aggregate has many uses: Aggregate for mixing new concrete: Crushed concrete can replace some of the virgin (new) aggregate used in ready-mix concrete. Used for road construction, buildings and bridge engineering. Used for permeable paving of sidewalks, driveways and other outdoor hard surfaces.

## Using Recycled Concrete Aggregate in New Concrete Pavement Mixes
In the 1980s, MnDOT and other state transportation agencies began using such recycled aggregate in the concrete course as well. But this latter practice was discontinued by the early 1990s due to mid-slab cracking observed in pavements constructed with such concrete. Using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in the base course has continued, however.

What is Crushed Concrete? Crushed concrete is made from larger chunks of concrete taken from other construction projects.

## Fresh and hardened properties of high-strength concrete incorporating 
This paper presents the fresh and hardened properties of high-strength concrete comprising byproduct fine crushed aggregates (FCAs) sourced from the crushing of three different types of rocks, namely granophyre, basalt, and granite. The lowest void contents of the combined fine aggregates were observed when 40% to 60% of natural sand is replaced by the FCAs. By the replacement of 40% FCAs, the
