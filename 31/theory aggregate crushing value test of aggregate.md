## crushing strength test on aggregates
TESTING OF AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE Aggregate crushing value is an indicator of the crushing resistance of the aggregates when a compressive load is increased. It is tested in accordance with BS 812:110, 1990 and aggregate passing a 14mm test sieve and retained on 10mm sieve are considered for the testing. The allowable range is 17 41.

Application of Aggregate Crushing Test: The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low.
