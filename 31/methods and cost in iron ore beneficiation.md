method of transportation is an iron ore slurry pipeline. 4.1.2 Iron Ore Beneficiation Iron ore occurs naturally in a variety of forms, from sand-like iron fines to solid rock masses. Crude ore, or ore mined in the natural state, seldom occurs in a pure state and requires some form of beneficiation.

## Beneficiation
For sulfide ores, a different process is taken for beneficiation. The ore needs to have the sulfur removed before smelting can begin. Roasting is the primary method of separating, where wood was placed on heaps of ore and set on fire to help with oxidation. 2 Cu 2 S + 3 O 2 → 2 Cu 2 O + 2 SO 2
