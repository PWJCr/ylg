## what is iron ore beneficiation process
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the
