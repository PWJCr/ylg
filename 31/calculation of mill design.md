Combined with the prevailing gold-silver ratio of 15, the standard for gold was calculated at 371/15 = 24.73 grains fine gold or 26.98 grains 22K gold. Rounding the latter to 27.0 grains finalized the dollar's standard to 24.75 grains of fine gold or 24.7515 = 371.25 grains = 24.0566 grams = 0.7735 troy ounces of fine silver.

## Milling Calculators and Formulas - Machining Doctor
Cutting speed is the relative linear velocity between the tip of the cutting edge and the workpiece. It is a result of the product between the rotation speed of the milling cutter (Spindle speed) and its circumference. C = 2 × π × r = π × d. V c = n × C. Important Note: The Diameter (d) should be the effective diameter and not the cutter
