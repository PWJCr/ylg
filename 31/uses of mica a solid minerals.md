## Mineral and Energy Resources: Definition, Types, Uses  - Collegedunia
Mineral Resources are naturally occurring substances that are found in the Earth's crust. These substances are generally inorganic in nature, are solid and have a crystal like structure. Scientists have identified around 2,000 minerals out of which maximum of them are inorganic. However, a few minerals like gold, silver, and sulfur are

## Difference between Rocks and Minerals: Types and Uses - Collegedunia
Non-metallic minerals include limestone, gypsum, and mica. Bauxite ore is found predominantly in badly worn rocks.  Energy minerals are used to generate power, fuel for transportation, heat homes and businesses, and make polymers.  Minerals and rocks are both solid, naturally created things found in or on the earth. Minerals do not form

## Halite salt: The mineral Halite information and pictures
Halite, the natural form of salt, is a very common and well-known mineral. It is found in solid masses, and as a dissolved solution in the oceans and in salt lakes. The inland lakes that are rich in salt exist in arid regions, and may also be below sea level without an outlet. These lakes evaporate during dry seasons, causing a recession in the water level and an increase of salinity content.

## Mineral
A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as limestone or quartzite, are composed primarily of one mineral - calcite or aragonite in the case of limestone, and quartz in the latter case. Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a granite is defined by proportions of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase feldspar.
