## How Does Marble Get Mined From a Quarry? - RIOSTONES
Mining marble blocks from the wall of the quarry starts with a "bench wall." The bench wall is a large section of marble along a vertical wall that is cut with diamond cables, drills, and torches. Dynamite loosens the bench wall from the side of the quarry, and the separated wall can then be processed and cut into individual, uniform blocks.

## From Quarry to Countertop: How Marble and Granite Are Mined
Aug 3, 2021Mining marble from a quarry involves creating a bench wall, which requires synthetic diamond wire and diamond-tipped drills to separate the rock to form a vertical plane. This involves drilling holes in the marble from the top of the quarry and lining up another drill hole from the side.

## How Does Mining Impact the Environment? | LoveToKnow
How Mining Methods Affect the Environment. There are many forms of mining depending on the resource being extracted. Each of these methods create types of pollution. Underground mining involves digging and tunneling to reach deep deposits like coal. Surface or strip mining removes surface vegetation and soil to exploit shallow deposits of coal.

Environmental hazards are present during every step of the open-pit mining process. Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed, these rocks expose radioactive elements, asbestos-like minerals, and metallic dust. During separation, residual rock slurries, which are mixtures of pulverized rock and
