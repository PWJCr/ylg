## DC Motor - Definition, Working, Types, and FAQs - BYJUS
A DC motor is defined as a class of electrical motors that convert direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. From the above definition, we can conclude that any electric motor that is operated using direct current or DC is called a DC motor. We will understand the DC motor construction and how a DC motor converts the supplied DC

When a dc voltage is applied to the field windings of a dc generator, current flows through the windings and sets up a - - steady magnetic field. This is called FIELD EXCITATION. This excitation voltage can be produced by the generator itself or it can be supplied by an outside source, such as a battery. DC Machines

## Studying DC Machine characteristics using MATLAB - Skill-Lync
Basic Construction of DC Machine. The rotating electrical or DC machine has mainly two parts; one is Stator, and another one is Rotar. The stator and rotor are separated from each other by an air gap. The stator is the outer frame of the machine and is immovable. The rotor is free to move and is the inner part of the machine.

## Construction and Working Principle of DC Generators
A DC generator has a field winding and an armature winding. The EMF induced in the armature winding of a DC generator is alternating one and is converted into direct voltage using a commutator mounted on the shaft of the generator. The armature winding of DC Generator is placed on the rotor whereas the field winding is placed on the stator.

## Construction of DC Machines
DC GENERATOR - INTRODUCTION . An electrical generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy, generally using electromagnetic induction.The source of mechanical energy may be a reciprocating or turbine steam engine, water falling through a turbine or waterwheel, an internal combustion engine, a wind turbine, a hand crank, or any other source of mechanical energy.
