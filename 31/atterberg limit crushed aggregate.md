The water content at which the soils change from one state to the other is known as consistency limits or Atterberg limit. The liquid state is the state of a fine-grained soil at which the soil will flow on its own weight. The plastic state is the condition at which the soil can be remolded to any shape without any development or cracks.

The Atterberg limits are a basic measure of the critical water contents of a fine-grained soil: its shrinkage limit, plastic limit, and liquid limit.. Depending on its water content, a soil may appear in one of four states: solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid.In each state, the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so are its engineering properties.

## Atterberg Limits | Geoengineer
The limit is defined as the moisture content, in percent, required to close a distance of 0.5 inches along the bottom of a groove after 25 blows in a liquid limit device. It is difficult to adjust the moisture content in the soil to meet the required 12.5 mm (0.5 in.) closure of the groove in the soil pat at 25 blows.
