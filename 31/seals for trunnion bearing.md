## Causes of Tire & Trunnion Wear - FEECO International Inc.
In the case of tires and trunnion rollers, fugitive material can cause excess wear in the form of abrasion, gouging, and/or corrosion on load-bearing surfaces. Similarly, tramp material in the trunnion pits may also cause severe damage to components, allowing the pinch point to act as a crusher, creating aggressive abrasion between the surfaces.

## Barricade Trunnion Bearing Seal - Metso Outotec
Barricade Trunnion Bearing Seals. The Barricade design is based on years of Metso Outotec experience with v-ring seals arranged on either side of a seal annular plate. In this type of arrangement, the seals and seal annular plate become the wear parts, both of which are substantially easier and cheaper to replace than a mill head.

In combination with high radial load (from weight of the blades and reaction force on blades), this can cause excessive wear of the trunnion/bearing assembly  Blade droop challenges the trunnion sealsâchanging the original cross-section for which the seals were designed, which has an impact on sealing devices, too.

## ball and trunnion | The Mopar Motorhead
The driveshaft was direct bolted to the transmission tailshaft. Also, the driveshaft narrowed down to a smaller shaft that had some ragged pieces of rubber hanging from it. This was strange. A little research on the Internet introduced me to ball and trunnion joints. They were used on Mopars from the 1940's until 1965.

## Trunnion Bearings | Industrial Babbitt Bearings Repair Manufacture 
We centrifugally cast bearings up to 120" OD using ASTM certified Babbitt compositions. The Babbitt alloy is melted in 2500 pound capacity ovens having strict temperature controls. Although most of our work is trunnion bearing repair, we have the engineering and technical expertise to manufacture new trunnion bearings as well.
