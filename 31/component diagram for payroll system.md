Component diagrams are used during the implementation phase of an application. However, it is prepared well in advance to visualize the implementation details.

## The Four Components of Payroll
The standard practice is to pay overtime at a certain percentage of the base pay rate. E.g. 125%. So if you were paid $10 an hour and then worked overtime you would get $10 multiplied by 125% which equals $12.50. For other multipliers, these work in the same manner as overtime but are applied in different scenarios.
