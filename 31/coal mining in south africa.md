## The future of coal in South Africa - Technology for Mining
The South African government has a plan for energy projection up to 2030. The hope is that an additional generating capacity of 9.5 GW of wind, 6.8 GW of solar, 6.7 GW of coal, and 2.5 GW of hydropower will be available by that time. This would still mean that South Africa would still be acquiring 64% of its power from coal.

## Finding Solutions for South Africa's Coal-Fired Energy and Water 
Furthermore, pollution from coal mining can irreparably harm water resources. In South Africa—one of the world's most water-stressed countries and one of the largest producers and consumers of coal—the water-energy nexus is a topic of great concern. South Africa's most important water stakeholders have a prime opportunity to respond.
