## Want to use crushed brick as a base for concrete patio
The masons just finished and left me a yard full of broken bricks. I need to build a small 8x10 slab that ranges from 4 inched deep to 15 inches deep, (slope of the land) and I remember hearing that crushed brick is a good base for concrete. So I payed my nephew to help me collect all the broke bricks and cart them over to the area where I want

Aug 23, 2022Crushed Stone. Crushed stone is the best option for a patio base and experts recommend crushed stone size for a patio that is 3/4-inches in size. Crushed stone comes in a wide range of sizes, from pebble to boulder-sized pieces and everything in between. The size you choose depends on how much traffic your project is expected to take.

Best sub base for a driveway. The base has to be strong enough to support a heavy load, and porous enough to let water drain through. Concrete is an excellent sub base for driveways, but it's hard to maintain once it is installed. Fine grading of aggregate adds porosity and drainage but makes concrete more prone to cracking.

## Is It Right To Use Crushed Stone Instead Of Sub Base
Crush and Run Instead of Gravel Under Slab. Sep 16, 2020The problem is the crush and run or "crusher run" as I've heard it called is compact-able and 57 stone gravel naturally is compacted when it's dumped/spread. so you have the chance of settlement under/of the concrete and or cracking of a slab with a compact-able sub-base unless you are able to fully compact it in lifts layer by layer.

## Do's and Don'ts of Paver Installation: Step 2 of 3 - Base  - Unilock
Use the correct bedding material. Avoid stone dust or limestone screenings, as these materials usually have too many fines (dust) that trap water that can cause early failure of the pavers. Sand is often used. Instead of sand, you can also use a small chip stone called "ASTM #9s," "HPB" or "clear 1/8″ chip."

## Construction Bases For Stone
We sell 4 construction bases for Landscape Stone work as shown below. These materials allow you to properly prepare the foundation for your stone project. Construction bases for stone are often used in combination, for instance crushed stone first and then quarry process on top (often with fabric separator between materials to prevent mixing and excessive settling).

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under  - Irwin Stone
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.
