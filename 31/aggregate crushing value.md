## Aggregate Crushing Value - Significance & Test Procedure
The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Conclusion - Quality Grinder
The Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) Test Set measures how resistant an aggregate is, when being crushed under a gradually applied compressive load. Each set consists of steel cylinder, plunger, base plate, cylindrical measure and tamping rod. For durability and reliability, all parts of the apparatus are galvanized steel or powder coated, heat

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.
