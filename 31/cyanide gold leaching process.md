The gold is mixed with the sodium cyanide which leads to the following Elsener's equation and reaction. This is done to make soluble gold; Now the gold is soluble. This method of making soluble gold is known as leaching. In the process of leaching, a dilute form of sodium cyanide is added into the ore containing the gold.

Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

We propose that cyanide has several likely roles: (1) The oxidative dissolution of metallic gold takes place with a removal of gold to solution. This action proceeds in a corrosive manner such that small Au particles are eaten away from the outer surface, so that it is quite possible that some smaller metallic particles may result.

## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining - Earthworks
A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

## Gold Cyanidation
Process. Cyanide can be used to extract gold, either in a controlled mill environment, or more crudely on rock piles in the open. Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water. The cyanide binds to the gold ions, and makes them soluble in water, thereby allowing separation from the rock.
