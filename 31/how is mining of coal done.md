## DANGERS OF COAL MINING - Coal Mining
One of the many dangers with coal mining is being caved in. A cave is when miners are trapped in the mine. This happens when When the walls and ceilings of underground mine shafts have not been properly secured. As a result of subsidence. If a mine shafts excavated too deeply, cracks can occur in the floor and walls of the shaft weakening

Longwall Miner. Twenty percent to 30 percent of mined coal underground is from longwall mining. This is performed by a mechanical cutter that shears coal off from a panel on the seam. The panel being worked on may be up to 800 feet in width and 7,000 feet in length. Mined coal is deposited onto a conveyor that moves the coal to a collection area.

How is coal extracted from mine? Coal miners use two primary methods to remove coal In surface mining, large machines remove the topsoil and layers of rock known as overburden to expose coal seams. Mountaintop removal is a form of surface mining where the tops of mountains are dynamited and removed to access coal seams.

Soft rock mines, such as coal, do not require the use of explosives for extraction. These rocks can be cut with the mining tools provided by modern technology. Soft rocks are also salt, potash, bauxite. In hard rock mines, extraction is carried out by drilling and blasting. First holes are made with compressed air or hydraulic drills.

## How Coal mining is done?pot
The two major schools of coal mining are surface mining and underground mining. To qualify for surface mining, the coal seam must lie within 60 metres of the surface. The miners' job is to remove all of the 'overburden' - the cubic tons of rock, soil and trees above the coal seam - and expose the coal layer for extraction.

## What is the process of collecting coal? - PostVines
Underground mining, sometimes called deep mining, is a process that retrieves coal from deep below the Earth's surface—sometimes as far as 300 meters (1,000 feet). Miners travel by elevator down a mine shaft to reach the depths of the mine, and operate heavy machinery that extracts the coal and moves it above ground.

## Opencast Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal mining by open-cut methods. A dragline is used to remove overburden from a gently dipping coal seam, placing it in spoil piles on the up-dip side (left). A pattern of blast holes has been drilled into the overburden on the right of the image. The coal is removed by a power shovel and placed into trucks for haulage from the mine.

## What are the main methods of mining? - American Geosciences Institute
PDF version There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.

## "Giant Shovel on I-70"Ohio Strip Mine Fight: 1973 - Pop History Dig
The February 1973 issue of Smithsonian magazine ran a dramatic shot of "The GEM of Egypt" in operation in the Egypt Valley of Ohio, just north of I-70, as the magazine featured a story on "the need for energy vs. strip mining.". Note size of the shovel's bucket relative to the vehicles on the road below. Photo, Arthur Sirdofsky.
