As a result of such decomposition, particles of bright lustrous gold, angular and ragged in shape, but of considerable size, often become apparent. These particles may be separated from the oxides of iron by washing, and the use of nitric acid, followed by panning, is frequently resorted to in order to detect gold in pyrites.

Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.
