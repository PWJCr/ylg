## Where Is Limestone Mined - Realonomics
Dec 17, 2021Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However underground limestone mines are found at places in the central and eastern United States especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime- stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

## how is limestone mineda
Feb 03, 2007 · Limestone is mined. The cheapest way to get it is to use the limestone rock closest to the surface. Most commonly, that involves quarrying, in which you dig a hole and build a road for trucks to carry the rock out. A lot of limestone gets used, so there are many quarries, wherever limestone is at or close to the surface.

21.) Coal Mines. Explosions caused by released methane gas are a common feature on coal mines. Limestone causes suppression of these explosions, hence, keeping the coal mines secure for quarrying. 22.) Food industry. Limestone is a major source of calcium. In the food industry, the calcium component in the rock is tapped and purified.
