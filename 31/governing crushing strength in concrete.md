Strength of concrete The compressive strength of concrete is measured by how much force is required to crush it, this is important in the design of structures. In pavements and other slabs on the ground, the design is usually based on flexural strength, (i.e.; how much force the concrete can withstand in bending before it breaks).

## What is the Characteristic Strength of Concrete - Civil Planets
The design strength is the required strength of concrete to be designed as per the IS code. For example, assume that the strength of concrete required M25, and the target design strength is 28.5 N/Sqmm. Now the chances of failure of concrete cubes fail at 25N/Sqmm is only 5%. The design strength is 28.5 N/Sqmm, and the characteristic strength

## Strength Deterioration due to Bond Slip and Concrete Crushing in 
A macromodel that represents the behavior of reinforced concrete members that accounts for strength degradation due to bond slip and crushing of concrete is developed. The model consists of
