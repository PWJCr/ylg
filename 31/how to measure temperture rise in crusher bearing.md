## How to Measure Bearings
To measure the bore of a bearing you can use a vernier caliper like the one shown. Insert the outer anvils of the caliper into the bore as shown and open the caliper until the bearing and caliper are a good fit about each other. Now read the value on the caliper. In the absence of a caliper a good quality steel ruler will suffice.

## How To Measure Jaw Crusher Bearing Temperature
Abnormal temperature rise of jaw crusher bearings Pay. Mar 08, 2021 Reasons for bearing damage For the jaw crusher, the role of the bearing is self-evident, once it is damaged, it is easy to cause downtime. However, in production, various problems will inevitably occur in the bearing, and abnormal temperature rise is one of the common faults.

## how to measure temperture rise in crusher bearing
If the oil hole can be used to directly measure the temperature of the outer ring of the high-temperature bearing, it is more suitable. 1.2 Generally, the temperature of high-temperature bearings starts to rise slowly with the operation of high-temperature bearings, and reaches a steady state after 1-2 hours

## Motor Temperature Rise (Causes and Limits) - Electrical4uonline
To estimate the proper bearing temperature if the outer ring cannot be accessed, take the measurement at the housing and add 15° to 20°F. In shielded electrical motor ball bearings, the grease given is still effective up to a temperature of about °F.
