## iron mining and its effect on enviroment
Assessment of Environmental Impact of Iron Ore Mining and. However, mining of iron ore has copious negative impacts on the environment. As the mining method for Iron is usually open cast, it degrades natural landscapes, surface and ground water, flora and fauna, as well as the ambient air quality within the mining area and its environs.

ARGONNE, ILL. (Sept. 6, 2012) â€” Using ultrafast X-rays, scientists for the first time have watched how quickly electrons hop their way through rust nanoparticles. This gives key insight to how iron oxide, one of the most abundant minerals in soil, behaves and alters the condition of soil and water around it. This also demonstrates the potential of time-resolved X-ray and optical methods to

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

Hardrock mining is a large-scale industrial activity that takes place in the natural environment, potentially disturbing large amounts of material and land area. Hardrock mining generates large volumes of mining waste because of the high waste-to-product ratios associated with producing most ores.

## How can metal mining impact the environment?
In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.

## Environment Iron Ore Mining
Open pit mining where material is excavated from an open pit is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.
