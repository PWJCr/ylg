## What Are Jaw Crushers And How Do They Work? - High Level Platform
Sep 3, 2020The main function of a jaw crusher is to reduce large-sized ore or rocks with the use of compression. The fixed jaw, which is typically positioned in a "V" alignment is a stationary "breaking surface". The jaw that moves exerts force or pressure onto the rocks by forcing these materials against a stationary plate.

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

Feb 18, 2021Jaw crushers typically use the principles of compression and friction to break materials down. They're extremely powerful equipment that should be used with the utmost care. Jaw crushers are so powerful that they've earned the moniker "rock breakers" because of their brute force. All jaw crushers will have one fixed jaw and a moving one.
