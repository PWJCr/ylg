## What a Can Crusher Is and How it works
The way how a can crusher works is pretty simple. Aluminum can crusher consists from a frame, handle with soft grip at the end, hinges, compressing plate and metal bolts that hold all mechanism together. These parts can be made from different materials, depending on the type of can crusher. Cheaper can crushers are made from plastic parts.

However, you'll find four basic designs—cone, jaw, gyratory, and impact crushers—operating within many crushing plants. Jaw Crushers In compression crushing, jaw crushers tend to be more of a blunt instrument compared to cone crushers, which is why they're often used in the primary rock crushing circuit stage.

A crusher is a machine that uses mechanical energy to break blocks of stone, concrete, or other building materials into smaller blocks of a specific grain size. They are particularly used in the mining industry to reduce the size of ore blocks and facilitate their processing. Crushers are designed to receive blocks of a maximum size.
