## What Is the Cost of Concreting?.au
Concrete cost per cubic metre sits at average $250 to $300/m3 for the material only, whereas it can start at low $160/m3 and reach even $550/m3 plus GST. You also need to count in $60 to $80 per hour for concreters' labour rates when calculating concreting costs on a per-cubic-metre basis.

## Cost of concrete - How much does concrete cost per cubic yard?
The cost per cubic yard of 3000 psi concrete for this slab was $92.00 dollars. That's $11,040.00 just for the concrete! The cost for a yard of concrete will vary in different parts of the country and all over the world. I can give you a good idea of what concrete cost per cubic yard in the Northeast part of the U.S.A. specifically Maine.

## Concrete cost.how much approximately? - Home.au
The best way to price concrete is per m 3 and allow approximately $650 for each cubic metre; for a 150mm thick slab you can then estimate $8500.00. Where are you located? I paid $200 a cube including GST earlier this year for my house slab.

## ready mix concrete price ? — boards.ie - Now Ye're Talkin'
Got a price for 30N today at €68 a meter in the southeast. Also doing blocks at 45 cent. Both prices including the VAT. Living in Carlow and need 2.5 cubic metres for a base of a dog run, 15 Newton probably do as absolutely no weight on it.

## Bricks: Ksh. 10 to 20 per piece. Machine cut: Ksh. 40 to 60 per piece 
The average cost of concrete is anywhere from $200 - $300 per m3 (cubic metre), though you could pay as much as $350 for 40 MPa strength. Variations in cost are due to local prices differing slightly, the type of concrete you order, and any additives or admixtures required.
