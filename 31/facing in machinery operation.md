## Cutting Tool Applications, Chapter 10: Boring Operations and Machines
Today's VBMs are often listed as turning and boring machines. If facing is added to that name, it pretty well describes the principal uses of this machine. Just like any lathe, these machines can make only round cuts plus facing and contouring cuts. Jig Borers Jig borers are vertical boring machines with high precision bearings. They are

## Basic Lathe Operations - Facing, Turning, Taper Turning, Parting Off 
Mar 18, .3.18. A lathe is a machine that helps in shaping up different materials and performing various operations such as: turning, facing, thread cutting, taper turning, knurling, parting off and more. For any machining operation the workpiece should be held firmly and centered. The devices used for this purpose are chuck and late dead center.

Turning Operation. Turning is a type of machining operation used to remove material from the outer diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. The workpiece is held in a chuck rotating at high speed during turning operation. A single-point cutting tool is fixed to the machine, and it moves in X and Y directions to cut the material.

## Countersinking, Counterboring, and Spotfacing - ASM Digital Library
Countersinking, counterboring, and spotfacing operations can be carried out on drilling machines and usually follow drilling operations. This article discusses five common types of countersinking tools or countersinks, namely, machine, three-flute, single-flute, insert-type, and interchangeable countersinks. It provides a short description of
