## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

The use of tin as a plating material dates to the time of the Roman Empire, when copper vessels were coated with tin to keep them looking bright. Tinned iron vessels appeared in central Europe in the 1300's. In 2010 archaeologists uncovered a vessel off the Devon Coast, which is thought to date back to around 900 BC.

The process of tinning is when anything gets coated with a layer of melted tin. Tinning is crucial because it limits corrosion on metal devices, parts, and solder joints; cleans up the ends of wires; and makes your soldering tip last longer. Soldering and working with wires is a messy and challenging job.

## Why mining is important?sewing
Why mining should be stopped? Mining activities increase the volume and rate of exposure of sulfur-containing rocks to air and water, creating sulfuric acid and dissolved iron.This acid run-off dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead and mercury which leach into ground water aquifers and surface water sources, harming humans and wildlife.
