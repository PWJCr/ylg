## How To Minimize The Blindness of Vibrating Screens
The blinding of the mesh prevents other fines from passing through the screen. As a result, efficiency is limited, production is reduced, and time is required to clean or replace the screen. Vibrating screens are an increasingly common type of screening used in many industries. They are often used to screen difficult, wet materials or fines.
