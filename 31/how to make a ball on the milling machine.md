## How to Hard-Mill Effectively | MoldMaking Technology
Use strong, precise toolholders. High-precision holders are crucial when hard milling to achieve maximum tool life. Run-out must be limited to less than .0004-inch to maximize tool life. Machinists can achieve this level of precision with most shrink-fit holders, milling chucks, high-precision collet chucks and select end-mill holders.

## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling. Milling Processes
Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed, the overall removal is quite brisk.

## Ball Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force, as opposed to the Scotch Tape or sonication that mainly use normal force. Ball mills, like the three roll machine, are a common occurrence in industry, for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process, there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.
