## Thread Milling vs. Tapping: Advantages & Disadvantages
The primary advantage of thread milling is the ability to control the fit. A threaded hole is milled at a high RPM and the tool helixes into a previously-milled hole. So, the machine operator has the ability to adjust thread size using a strategy similar to using an end mill, rather than a drill bit to make a hole.
