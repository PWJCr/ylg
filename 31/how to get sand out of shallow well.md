Joined Feb 4, 2011. 259 Posts. Discussion Starter Â· #1 Â· May 31, 2016. The standard size well pipe for a sand point is 1 1/4" and is good up to 20 - 25 feet deep. Anything deeper, you have to go to 2". I have a hydraulic post pounder so installing either size is a piece of cake. I'm only going about 15 feet deep.

A shallow well jet pump will suck air from joints that will not leak when pressure is on it. Also water can only be sucked up 31 feet vertical in a pure vacuum at sea level. As you altitude above sea level rises, the vertical distance water can be sucked up decreases. Very few jet pumps are more than 80% efficient.
