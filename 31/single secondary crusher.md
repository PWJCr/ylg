## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing? - Eagle Crusher
Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that exist to

Types of crusher depend on the feeding method. These are- Primary crusher, Secondary crusher and Tertiary crusher. The primary crusher is only for the breaking of large stones into pieces (this means primary crusher is not for the aggregate size material.). Examples of primary crushers are jaw crusher; hammer mill crusher and gyratory crusher.
