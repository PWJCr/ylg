Mining also creates knock-on effects — like water pollution, air pollution and vegetation loss as a result of soil eruption. This can lead to greater habitat loss beyond the immediate location. Habitat Destruction Caused By Mining Habitats can be restored after mining operations are finished, but some impacts will linger.

## Artisanal gold‐mining in a rural environment: Land degradation in Kenya 
Artisanal gold-mining (AGM) is one of the most important activities in the districts of Migori and Transmara (Kenya). Gold-mining, however, is known to release vast quantities of arsenic and metals (some of which are very toxic like As, Hg, Cd, or Pb), which poses a serious threat to not only miners but also to the ecosystem and local populations.

Migori District is located in Nyanza Province of Western Kenya (Fig. 17.1). It lies in the southern part of the Winam Gulf in Lake Victoria. Here, the gold that occurs in the quartz veins of the Archeaean rocks of the Nyanzian Group was first discovered in 1920. Although episodes of large-scale mining occurred in Nyanza until the mid-1960s, artisanal mining has persisted to date. Currently
