Ratios should always be presented in their simplified form. You can simplify a ratio by dividing both sides by the highest common factor. For example, 12:4 simplified would be 3:1 - both sides of the ratio divided by 4. Equivalent ratios can be divided and/or multiplied by the same number on both sides, so as above, 12:4 is an equivalent.
