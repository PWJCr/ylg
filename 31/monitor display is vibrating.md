## Display image vibrates / shakes / jitters / is blurry
About a few days ago, the screen on my Surface Pro 4 started intermittently looking like it was 'vibrating'. That is, the images on the screen, including lines, pictures, and text, seem to be moving or duplicate just a pixel or two to the top/bottom.  If Task Manager does flicker, a display driver is probably causing the problem.

## Troubleshoot screen flickering in Windows
Screen flickering in Windows 11 is usually caused by a display driver issue or incompatible app. To determine whether a display driver or app is causing the problem, check to see if Task Manager flickers. Then, based on that information, you'll need to update, rollback, or uninstall your display driver or update or uninstall the app.

## Why the display of T27A950 monitor is vibrating, static, or wavy lines 
The wavy lines or static on your LCD monitor might be caused by other electronic devices (cell phones, cordless phones, rotating fans) that are too close to the monitor or by devices plugged into the same circuit as the monitor.

## Why the display of T27A950 monitor is vibrating, static, or wavy lines 
Sep 15, 2020Why the display of T27A950 monitor is vibrating, static, or wavy lines on it? Last Update date : Sep 15. 2020 The wavy lines or static on your LCD monitor might be caused by other electronic devices (cell phones, cordless phones, rotating fans) that are too close to the monitor or by devices plugged into the same circuit as the monitor.

## Screen Shakes/Vibrates with native resolution 1920X1080
I have recently built a second computer which I also use with the same Samsung Syncmaster P2350. When I go to select the native resolution of 1920X1080 for the second newer computer, the screen shakes/vibrates. All I can do is change the resolution to something lower but it looks like crap when I go to say 1600 X 1200 resolution.
