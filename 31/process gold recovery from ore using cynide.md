Gold recovery can become uneconomical when cyanide-soluble base metals such as copper and zinc are present in gold ore deposits. These metals form weak acid dissociable (WAD) complexes with the cyanide and preferentially competes for cyanide. The result is high cyanide consumption, poor gold doré purity and high concentrations of copper

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## Activated Carbon Gold Recovery | Puragen Activated Carbons
Gold Recovery Process. For gold recovery, water and a cyanide such as calcium cyanide, sodium cyanide, or potassium cyanide, are added to ore or scraps to form a slurry. The gold will leach out and mix with the cyanide into a solution. Activated carbon is then used to separate and store the gold, which is removed as the final step of the process.

## A Review on Alternative Gold Recovery Re-agents to Cyanide
A gold extraction rate of 99% can be achieved at optimal conditions which are a low pH level of 1 - 2 as well as the presence of oxygen and iron as an oxidant. Other advantages to cyanide are a low sensitivity to base metals and sulfur containing calcines, as well as adequate recovery from preg-robbing ores.
