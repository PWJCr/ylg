The historic town of Granite lies just 15 miles north of Sumpter, in the ghost town-dotted Blue Mountains region of northeastern Oregon. This is yet another former gold-mining town, once bustling and now nearly deserted. During the gold rush of the late-1800s, Granite's population numbered about 5,000 people, quite a high number in those days.
