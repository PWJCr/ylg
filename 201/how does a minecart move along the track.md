## minecraft java edition - How do you use the powered minecart  - Arqade
I recommend waiting for a bug fix or using lots of Powered Rails if you have the gold. You don't need every rail to be powered for moving empty/chest minecarts; every other tile is sufficient for a diagonal slope, and up to, oh, about 16 apart should be fine on the flat. Share.

In fact if you were to use a minecart to place tracks and accidentally fell off the incomplete edge of the track, you'd waste quite a bit of construction time, whereas the normal method of using a hook to place tracks only requires you to press the R key every once and a while to move forward and guarantees you won't fall or lose your place.

After you place it on rails (it won't move very fast on regular ground) you should be able to put coal or charcoal into it to power it.
