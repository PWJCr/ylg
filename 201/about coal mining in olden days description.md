## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Modern mining jobs. Ore and personnel movement in a mineshaft are still done with skips, cages and hoists, to this day. But technology allows for wireless communication between the surface and underground and continuous movement of ore through the use of conveyors and skips.

The last coal mine in the Saginaw Valley closed in 1952. In the mid-1970s, an open pit mine operated for a brief time in Ingham County. In the early 1980s, thousands of acres of abandoned coal mines were leased for strip mining the remaining coal, but this operation was abandoned before it began due to a halt in coal prices.

A weaving mill was built at Green Booth during the 1840s, on or near the site of a former corn mill that was probably erected during the 18th century. The new mill was owned by James Butterworth of Norden, and specialised in the production of woollen flannel. Coal for the mill came from the nearby East Knowl colliery.

## Coal mining has negative impact on freshwater stream biodiversity
The study reported that streams affected by coal mining had, on average, a one-third reduction in biodiversity and only half of the total organism abundance of unaffected streams. Invertebrate, fish, and salamander species richness (e.g., the number of different species living in the stream) declined by 32%, 39%, and 28%, respectively.
