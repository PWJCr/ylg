## USGS Scientists Help Address Conflict Mining
Jun 27, 2022The concept of conflict diamonds or "blood diamonds" emerged in the late 1990s when it became evident that several violent civil wars in Africa were connected to mining and trading of rough diamonds. In 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey was asked by the U.S. Department of State to help address illegal diamond mining in Africa.

Alluvial gold miners in Brazil found what they described as 'curious pebbles' in 1725, which were subsequently identified as diamonds. Alluvial diamonds were discovered in 1859 in South Africa and in 1869 mining of the hard rock sources of diamonds started at Kimberley, the capital of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa.
