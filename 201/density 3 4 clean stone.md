Sandstone. 2.2-2.8. Shale. 2.4-2.8. Slate. 2.7-2.8. As you can see, rocks of the same type can have a range of densities. This is partly due to different rocks of the same type containing different proportions of minerals. Granite, for example, can have a quartz content anywhere between 20% and 60%.

## How much volume is lost after compacting 3/4" crushed stone?
The loose drop weight of a relatively uniform (all the rocks are similar size and shape) 3/4" stone will be about 80-90% depending on the stone (angularity and phi). Presuming that you are compacting to 100% of some form of "proctor density", because you're awesome at compacting and have a monster machine (and thin lifts), that's 100/80=125%.

## Urine
Urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in humans and in many other animals. Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the urinary bladder. Urination results in urine being excreted from the body through the urethra.. Cellular metabolism generates many by-products that are rich in nitrogen and must be cleared from the bloodstream, such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine.
