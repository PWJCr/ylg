Coal Grinding. To achieve good combustion and satisfactory flame formation, coal needs to be dried and ground to a proper degree of dryness and fineness. Drying of moisture in coal is achieved normally by ducting part of the kiln exhaust gas through the mill with inlet temperatures of up to 300°C. Inert kiln exhaust gases with oxygen content

## Rotary Kiln - Dalmia GSB
The first reaction zone of rotary kiln system is known as the preheating zone. Here the charge gets heated up to about 800℃ before entering the calcining zone. Bricks in this area are prone to chemical attack from gases containing alkali and sulphur. Thermal insulating property of the refractories in this area results in substantial fuel savings.

## Reactions of alkalis, chlorine and sulfur during clinker production
Cl behavior in a cement kiln has been examined by the application of WDF with high [Cl] and by the addition of Cl in raw meal, since Cl is introduced to the kiln through the raw materials and fuel

## How To Make Stable Coating In Cement Kiln
Jun 11, 2008 Re: Coating formation in Kiln Inlet. Hi. Coating at kiln inlet ia mainly due to the volatiles like Chlorides, alkalies ( Na2O and K2O) and SO3. To minimise the coating formation, the alkali sulfate ratio should be around 1.1 so that these volatiles will come out as alkali sulfate along with the clinker so that the recirculation
