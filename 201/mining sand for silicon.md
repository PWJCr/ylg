## Silica - Minerals Education Coalition
Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

## The mining of sand, a non-renewable resource - GreenFacts
What are the main issues with sand mining? Negative effects on the environment are unequivocal and are occurring around the world. The volume being extracted is having a major impact on rivers, deltas and coastal and marine ecosystems results in loss of land through river or coastal erosion, lowering of the water table and decreases in the amount of sediment supply.

## When Sand Becomes Serious - The Ethics of Silica Mining
The silica is of a special grade and is in high demand by the oil and gas industry for drilling; what is one company's sand is another company's gold! Clearly, if Suchla had advocated in the manner for which he is accused, it is quite serious. It allows the company with whom he has associated to continue mining while new companies are barred.

Silica is the common name for silicon dioxide, a white or colorless compound found naturally in sand, granite and many other types of rock. Quartz is the most common form of silica and is the second most common mineral in the earth's surface. Since it is so abundant, quartz is present in nearly all mining operations.

## Sand
The most common constituent of sand, in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings, is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO 2), usually in the form of quartz, which, because of its chemical inertness and considerable hardness, is the most common mineral resistant to weathering.. The composition of mineral sand is highly variable, depending on the local rock sources and conditions.
