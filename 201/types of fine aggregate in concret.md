Feb 24, 2022What are Fine Aggregates? Any natural sand or crushed stone particles that can pass through the IS Sieve of 4.75mm and retain on a 0.15 mm sieve are fine aggregates. So, 4.75mm is the largest possible size for fine aggregates. This size gives very dense concrete. But, masonry work and plastering works require very fine types of sand.

The aggregate is the base material for concrete and provides bulk (70-80% of cement concrete volume is coarse aggregate). It limits the shrinkage of cement concrete upon drying. The coarse and fine aggregate mixture is used as a base and sub-base course in road construction. The coarse aggregate mixed with bitumen is used in wearing coats of roads.

## HOW AGGREGATE PROPERTIES AFFECTS CONCRETE PROPERTIES 
Grading of aggregates is an important aspect as they can influence the various properties of concrete such as cohesion, water demand, workability and strength. Aggregates should be well graded and consistent in their grading. Fine aggregates are the aggregates, most of which passes through 4.75 mm IS sieve and contained only so much coarser

## Types of Light Weight Aggregates | Materials | Concrete Technology
When cinders are used as coarse as well as fine aggregate, the density of the concrete will be of the order of 1100 to 1400 kg/m 3. But in order to improve the workability of the mix, often natural sand is used as fine aggregate. In this case the density of the resulting concrete will vary from 1750 to 1850 kg/m 3. ii. Breeze:

## Aggregate in Concrete - Concrete Network
Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation, maximum size, unit weight, and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.

## Types Of Concrete Used In Construction Work [25 types] - DAILY CIVIL
There are 25 different types of concrete discussed below. 1. Plain Cement Concrete (PCC): Plain Cement Concrete is a basic concrete mix consisting of cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, admixtures (optional), and water. PCC is very strong in compression.
