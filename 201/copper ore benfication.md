## Copper beneficiation equipment, Copper ore beneficiation process 
Copper beneficiation process Communition (Crushing and Grinding) represents over 50% of the total mineral processing cost. There has been a development towards Autogenous Grinding, which is the grinding of ore by itself rather by special metallic or non-metallic grinding bodies distinct from the ore.

## Copper Ore Beneficiation Plant
Mar 10, 2021 The copper ore beneficiation process generally adopts a relatively simple process. After one stage grinding, the fineness -200 mesh accounts for about 50% to 70%, 1 roughing, 2 to 3 selections, and 1 to 2 sweeping. If the copper mineral impregnation particle size is relatively fine, the stage grinding process can be considered.

Apr 11, 2022The ore types of copper-nickel sulfide ore are mainly magmatic-melted copper-nickel ore. When the nickel content is more than 3 %, it is rich and can be directly smelted. When the nickel content is less than 3 %, it needs beneficiation treatment. When the nickel ore content is less than 3 %, it is mainly accompanied by a large number of metal minerals and gangue minerals.

Since many other metal substances are associated with many copper ore, there are three types of flotation methods for copper ore. The first is the preferential flotation method: when the ore contains two or more useful minerals, the

## CNA - Beneficiation method for copper-nickel sulfide ore 
The invention relates to a beneficiation method for copper-nickel sulfide ore. The method comprises the steps of firstly separating raw ores through two-section grinding flotation operation to obtain high-grade concentrate and two-section copper-nickel bulk concentrate, carrying out primary magnetic separation and tailing discarding on flotation tailings, carrying out secondary magnetic
