Chalcopyrite extracting copper from Sherritt-Cominco A process for extracting copper from chalcopyrite, CuFeS2. The ore is reduced with hydrogen, the iron leached out with sulfuric acid, the residual Cu5FeS4 dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid, and the copper isolated by electrowinning or hydrogen reduction. Pilot testing was complete in 1976.

## How many metals are present in copper pyrites?
A yellow metallic mineral consisting of iron, copper, and sulfur. How many metals are present in the ore chalcopyrite? Chalcopyrite contains 34.5% Cu, 30.5% Fe, and 35.0% S. The mineral is the principal source of copper metal, and one of the major source of sulfur.

## A copper ore contains 3.0% of copper carbonate, CuCO3 by mass  - Quora
Answer (1 of 4): First of all work out how much copper carbonate there is in the ore. That's not hard. Write this figure down with an appropriate caption. Now check your periodic table for the atomic masses of copper, carbon and oxygen. Work out the molecular mass of a combination of one, one an

## Solvometallurgical process for extraction of copper from chalcopyrite 
Extraction of copper from sufidic ores, either by pyrometallurgy or hydrometallurgy, has various limitations. In this study, a solvometallurgical process for the extraction of copper from sulfidic ore minerals (chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite and digenite) was developed by using an organic lixiviant (FeCl 3 as oxidizing agent and ethylene glycol (EG) as organic solvent).
