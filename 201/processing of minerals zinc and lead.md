## Gold Mining
The i350 is a family member of the Falcon Gravity Concentrators Gold Mining Equipment which has revolutionizing the world of alluvial gold mining and dredging the same way its little brother, the i150, has impacted the world of hard rock mining. This is a gravimetric mineral concentrator that uses enhanced gravity (G's) to concentrate the 'free' heavy minerals. It is also known as a

## Copper Lead Zinc Metallurgy - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Monthly composites of mill feed, copper concentrate, lead concentrate, zinc concentrate and final tailing were sent for detailed mineralogical/metallurgical analysis. These samples were analyzed and also compared to previous similar work done. The samples represented the following flowsheet and monthly balance:
