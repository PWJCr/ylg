Coal mines in pre-industrial China. Ancient people in current China started using coal around 6 000 years ago. Historians suspects that the Chinese were involved in the surface mining of coal around 3490 BC, pioneering the pre-modern world. Fushan mine uses [clarification needed] to be pointed out as the earliest coal mine in the ancient world and started around 1 000 BC.
