Now the weapon that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, was a U-235, a fully enriched U-235 weapon, where the material was separated and purified in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The one that was dropped August 9 th on Nagasaki was a plutonium weapon made at Hanford. But to those of us out in the Pacific, it was quite interesting.

## Are uranium and plutonium used as nuclear fuels?
May 30, 2022The three most relevant fissile isotopes are uranium-233, uranium-235 and plutonium-239. Is uranium a nuclear fuel? Uranium is the main fuel for nuclear reactors, and it can be found in many places around the world. In order to make the fuel, uranium is mined and goes through refining and enrichment before being loaded into a nuclear reactor.

## Production of Plutonium in Reactors - Nuclear Energy - Brian Williams
Sep 5, 2022Thus, even a small graphite-moderated reactor can in a few years produce enough weapons-grade plutonium for a modest nuclear arsenal, at a rate of about 1 bomb per 5000 MWd(t) of operation. To achieve "super" and "weapons" grades of plutonium, as defined in Table 17.2, the burnups should be about 0.3 and 0.9 GWd/t, respectively [16, p. 463].

## Plutonium : an incomparable energy power
The Orano Group contributes directly to this recycling by separating the nuclear materials and waste contained in used nuclear fuels. Of the 96% of recoverable materials, plutonium, representing 1%, has considerable energy potential. One gram of plutonium can produce as much energy as 100 g of uranium or 1 metric ton of oil.

The uranium and plutonium are separated in turn in a series of complex chemical operations. The uranium becomes uranyl nitrate and the plutonium will be converted into plutonium oxide. The latter is used to produce fresh fuel called MOX - mixed oxides of uranium and plutonium, which can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors. [5]

## Uranium
Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons.Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years.

Although uranium-235 has also been used, it is currently considered a secondary isotope. Plutonium-239 is also one of the three major isotopes used as fuel in nuclear reactors, along with uranium-235 and uranium-233. The "Fat Man" atomic bomb that was used to bomb Nagasaki had a plutonium-239 core. The 239Pu has a half-life of 24,200 years.

## Why Uranium and Plutonium? - Atomic Archive
Scientists knew that the most common isotope, uranium 238, was not suitable for a nuclear weapon. There is a fairly high probability that an incident neutron would be captured to form uranium 239 instead of causing a fission. However, uranium 235 has a high fission probability. Of natural uranium, only 0.7% is uranium 235.

## Science Behind the Atom Bomb | Atomic Heritage Foundation
Science. Date: Thursday, June 5, 2014. The immense destructive power of atomic weapons derives from a sudden release of energy produced by splitting the nuclei of the fissile elements making up the bombs' core. The U.S. developed two types of atomic bombs during the Second World War. The first, Little Boy, was a gun-type weapon with a uranium core.

## How is uranium made into nuclear fuel?
The vast majority of nuclear power reactors use the isotope uranium-235 as fuel; however, it only makes up 0.7% of the natural uranium mined and must therefore be increased through a process called enrichment. This increases the uranium-235 concentration from 0.7% to between 3% and 5%, which is the level used in most reactors.

## Uranium, plutonium, heavy water . why Iran's nuclear deal matters
The hardest part of making a nuclear weapon is to produce a "critical mass" of either U-235 or the plutonium isotope Pu-239 in the right ratios: in the case of uranium, U-235 must be enriched

## How much uranium is used in a nuclear bomb?
To make a nuclear reactor, the uranium needs to be enriched so that 20% of it is uranium 235. For nuclear bombs, that figure needs to be nearer 80 or 90%. Get around 50kg of this enriched uranium - the critical mass - and you have a bomb. Any less and the chain reaction would not cause an explosion.
