Dissolved air flotation (DAF) provides thickening of sludges by encouraging the solids to float to the surface, rather than allowing them to sink to the tank base as with gravity thickening, where they can be removed by a skimmer. DAF is applied when the sludge solids are neutrally buoyant (i.e. neither sink nor float) and so cannot be readily

Froth flotation is a process that selectively separates materials based upon whether they are water repelling (hydrophobic) or have an affinity for water (hydrophilic). Importantly, the word flotation is also used in the literature to describe the process in density separation in which lighter microplastics float to the surface of a salt solution.

## RCS™ flotation machines - Metso Outotec
Enhanced performance. Metso Outotec RCS™ flotation machines have made several advances in flotation design and technology. Maximize bubble-particle contact within the mechanism and the flotation tank leads to enhanced performance. Effective air dispersion and distribution throughout the cell volume helps in smooth froth surface and removal.

Dissolved Air Flotation DAF is a flotation process that aims to remove low density pollutants in liquids such as sludge, alum,anisms, emulsions or oil droplets .This process uses millions of small micron sized bubbles to separate these particles .The efficiency of a DAF process depends directly on the concentration of bubbles in the water .
