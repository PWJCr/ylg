## Process Of Producing Sponge Iron Pellets
Sponge Iron An Overview | Sciencedirect Topics. Dri, also known as sponge iron, is the product of reducing iron oxide in the form of iron ore and steel plant wastes into metallic iron, below the melting point of iron and typically in the range of c. iron oxide is charged into shaft furnace, rotary kiln, or fluidized beds in the form of pellet, iron ore lumps, or fines. the reduction

## Difference Between Sponge Iron and Pig Iron
That is; the production process of sponge iron is a liquid state process whereas it is a solid state process for pig iron. Summary - Sponge Iron vs Pig Iron. Both sponge iron and pig iron are two basic forms of iron that we can obtain via processing natural iron ore.

## Direct Reduced Iron - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), also known as Sponge Iron, offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI, iron ore is reduced in its solid state - unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East, South America, India and Mexico.

## Sponge Iron Division - Trimula Industries
Major DRI production processes are either gas based or coal based. Feed material in a DRI process is either iron ore sized to 10 to 30mm or iron ore pellets produced in an iron ore pellet plant. In a coal based plant, the reactor for the reduction reaction is an inclined horizontal rotary kiln.

## Direct reduced iron process - tec-science
The reduction of iron oxides takes place according to the following chemical equations: (1) F e 2 O 3 + 3 C O → 2 F e + 3 C O 2 (2) F e 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 → 2 F e + 3 H 2 O. In contrast to the blast furnace process, the direct-reduced iron process operates at temperatures of up to 1000 °C. The iron ores are therefore not melted!

## Sponge Iron
Growth in the sponge iron production can be attributed largely to the popularity of secondary steelmaking route, which has shown a phenomenal growth in India.  The process of sponge iron manufacturing involves removal of oxygen from iron ore. When that happens, the departing oxygen causes micro pores in the ore body, turning it porous.

## Difference Between Sponge Iron and Pig Iron | Compare
The key difference between sponge iron and pig iron is that we can produce sponge iron by direct reduction of iron ore through reducing agents whereas the production of pig iron is by melting iron ore with charcoal and limestone at very high pressures.  it will undergo another heating and melting process. Carbon steel is derived from pig iron.

The Sponge Iron Process (SIR) is a well-known technology for the production and purification of hydrogen. It consists of a cyclic process in which a feed gas, rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen (e.g. syngas), is passed on an iron oxide (magnetite Fe3O4) at high temperature. Magnetite is reduced to wuestite (FeO) or iron while carbon monoxide
