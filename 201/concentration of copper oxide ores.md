## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

These depressants were extensively examined on copper oxide ores from the Nchanga mine in Zambia.  Processing of sulfide minerals is emphasized because these minerals account for virtually all Cu concentration. Copper ores typically contain 0.5-2% Cu.

After crushing oxide-type copper ores, such as azurite (2CuCO 3 Cu(OH)3), brochantite (CuSO 4), chrysocolla (CuSiO 3 2H 2 O) and cuprite (Cu2O), dilute sulfuric acid is applied to the surface of the material on leaching pads or in leaching tanks. As the acid trickles through the ore, it combines with the copper

## Copper Concentrates - Cargo Handbook - the world's largest cargo 
The beginning for all copper is to mine sulfide and oxide ores through digging or blasting and then crushing it to walnut-sized pieces. Crushed ore is ball or rod-milled in large, rotating, cylindrical machines until it becomes a powder usually containing less than 1 percent copper. Sulfide ores are moved to a concentrating stage, while oxide
