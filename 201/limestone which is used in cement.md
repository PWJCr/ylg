Portland-limestone cement, or PLC, is engineered with a higher limestone content than portland cement to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by about 10%. It performs just like the cement you're used to using, resulting in the same concrete you're used to having. The same specifications, the same mix design, now with a better carbon profile.

Portland cement is a successor to a hydraulic lime that was first developed by John Smeaton in 1756 when he was called in to erect the Eddystone Lighthouse off the coast of Plymouth, Devon, England. The next development, taking place about 1800 in England and France, was a material obtained by burning nodules of clayey limestone.

Environmental Benefits. Portland Limestone Cement is environmentally friendly, making it a smart option when building sustainably. The addition of limestone allows for a reduction in clinker, one of the main contributors of CO 2 in cement. This clinker reduction results in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint.

## limestone | Characteristics, Formation, Texture, Uses, & Facts
Sep 9, 2022limestone, sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually in the form of calcite or aragonite. It may contain considerable amounts of magnesium carbonate (dolomite) as well; minor constituents also commonly present include clay, iron carbonate, feldspar, pyrite, and quartz. Most limestones have a granular texture. Their constituent grains range in size from 0.001 mm (0.
