At the same time, very few new iron ore mines have been built or are in development, and the mines that are being built are largely replacing operations that are running out of ore. Higher grade = less impurities . Pure hematite is about 70 per cent Fe. The rest is impurities that require energy to remove them in the iron making process.

## Iron Ore Processing - Prominer (Shanghai) Mining Technology Co.,Ltd.
Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.
