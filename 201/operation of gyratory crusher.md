Gyratory Crusher Operation. Most crushing operations are performed under dry conditions. Water is only used occasionally as a lubricant to wash or flush the fines and sticking material on crusher surfaces. Gyratory crushers can accept 8-10% moisture in operation, but the fine content should be preferably less than 10%. بیشتر

## Crusher
A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a

Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).
