## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

## Gold Mining Methods
Summary. Historically, the majority of gold was mined from "placer deposits", where gold has settled out of an existing or ancient waterway downstream of where nuggets had eroded out of rock outcrops.Some early miners also used an early form of hardrock mining, digging solid veins of gold out of rock, where mineralized water had deposited it over thousands of years.
