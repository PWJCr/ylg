## Diplomat Mine shovels and draglines - 1997 | Exploring History
While coal mining had taken place here as early as 1907, these were minor underground operations. Later Luscar Coals took an interest in the site and in 1950 established a surface mine here. This makes it an early example of this type of mine in Canada - at that date most coal was still being mined underground.

Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.
