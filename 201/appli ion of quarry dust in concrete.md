In Sweden, the application of SCC is well established and according to Petersson [16], the cost of SCC is only 10-15% higher, while in France [17] the cost is 50-100%

## Application Of Quarry Dust In Concrete
Studies On Quarry Dust As Partial Replacement Of Fine. May 05, 2017 Quarry dust can be used as an economic alternative to the natural sand. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize quarry dust as a partial substitute for natural sand in producing concrete. Natural sand is replaced by Quarry dust at an interval of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25.
