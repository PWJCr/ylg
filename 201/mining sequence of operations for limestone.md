## Limestone - PUB2902 | Missouri Department of Natural Resources
Oct 13, 2020Mining. Limestone has been a valuable resource since Missouri became a state. In early open pit operations, limestone was mined and crushed by hand and removed from the quarries by mules, carts and tramways. Limestone is now mined using surface and underground methods. Surface quarrying is the most common method of producing limestone in Missouri.

Feb 26, 2022Limestone is mined by a method called quarrying. In this method,the overburden rocks scrapped off with mechanical excavators in order to reach the limestone. The limestone is then shattered with explosives and scooped out by the excavators into trucks waiting t carry it to the factory. 161. LIVER FLUKE.
