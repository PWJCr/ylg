Coal seams are relatively thick and close to the surface, which allows for low-cost mining; a quarter of South Africa's bituminous coal is between 15-50 m below the surface and much of the remainder between 50-200m. Half of reserves are in seams 4-6m thick and a further third in 2-4m seams (Petrick Commission, 1975).

## The future of coal in South Africa - Technology for Mining
The South African government has a plan for energy projection up to 2030. The hope is that an additional generating capacity of 9.5 GW of wind, 6.8 GW of solar, 6.7 GW of coal, and 2.5 GW of hydropower will be available by that time. This would still mean that South Africa would still be acquiring 64% of its power from coal.
