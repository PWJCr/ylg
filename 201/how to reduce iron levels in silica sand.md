The production of sand fillers is simple because it includes, at most, only washing and classification into grades differing in grain size. Because sand has a negligible degree of porosity, it has an extremely low specific surface area in the range from 40 to 160 cm 2 /g. The material usually contains more than 99.7% SiO 2, with absorbed water being at a negligible level (0.1%).

## Five efficient methods of removing iron from silica sand
For example, in glass production, iron impurities will do great harm to the production and quality of glass, especially to the thermodynamic properties of glass melting process and the transparency of glass products. Therefore, it is very important to improve the quality of silica sand and reduce the content of iron in the production process.
