Concept of Consumption Function: J. M. Keynes first introduced the term 'consump­tion function' in 1936 to describe the relationship be­tween household's planned consumption expendi­ture and all the above forces that determine it. In order to develop a theory we have to hold all the vari­ables, except one, constant.

## Aggregate Expenditure: Consumption | Macroeconomics | | Course Hero
First, consumption expenditure increases as income does. For every increase in income, consumption increases by the MPC times that increase in income. Thus, the slope of the consumption function is the MPC. Second, at low levels of income, consumption is greater than income. Even if income were zero, people would have to consume somet hing.

Consumption function refers to the standard equation of consumption which defines the relationship between consumption and income where consumption value can be derived at each level with the use of income value. C= c+ bY where c=autonomous consumption, b= marginal propensity to consume, and Y= income.

## The Keynesian Consumption Function Explained
The Keynesian Consumption Function. The Keynesian consumption function focuses on establishing the important link between the main component of aggregate demand, i.e. consumption, and the level of national income. Consumption (which is the sum of peoples' spending) accounts for around 60% of national income in most developed economies.

Relevance and Uses. Consumption function equation describes C = c+bY. If the value of (By) is higher, the total consumption value will increase. It certainly says that if income increases, expenditure also increases. We must consider that the income increase rate is more than the expenditure increase rate.
