Concept of Consumption Function: J. M. Keynes first introduced the term 'consumpÂ­tion function' in 1936 to describe the relationship beÂ­tween household's planned consumption expendiÂ­ture and all the above forces that determine it. In order to develop a theory we have to hold all the variÂ­ables, except one, constant.

## Aggregate Expenditure: Consumption | Macroeconomics | | Course Hero
First, consumption expenditure increases as income does. For every increase in income, consumption increases by the MPC times that increase in income. Thus, the slope of the consumption function is the MPC. Second, at low levels of income, consumption is greater than income. Even if income were zero, people would have to consume somet hing.

The Keynesian Consumption Function. The Keynesian consumption function focuses on establishing the important link between the main component of aggregate demand, i.e. consumption, and the level of national income. Consumption (which is the sum of peoples' spending) accounts for around 60% of national income in most developed economies.
