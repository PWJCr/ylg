## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## thu iron ore blue dust
The blue dust is a deep blue colored, fine powdery, hematitic iron ore containing more than 64% Fe and is considered the best grade of iron ore. Mainly, the iron ores at KMIOD are powdery (blue dust/soft friable ores) in nature, along with hard massive or laminated ores and the ratio between powdery to hard massive ore is 7030.
