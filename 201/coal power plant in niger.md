## Coal mining in Niger
Coal exploitation in Niger is carried out by Société nigérienne du charbon (SONICHAR, the coal corporation of Niger). SONICHAR was created in 1975. It operates an open pit coal mine in Anou Araren in the Agadez Region. It also operates a power plant 2 km away from coal mine.The Anou Araren coal reserves are estimated at 15 million tonnes and in 2011, 246,016 tonnes of coal were extracted

Mapped: The world's coal power plants in 2020. Mar 26, 2020 The map shows coal capacity, whereas electricity generation and CO2 emissions depend on a range of other factors. Most important is how often coal plants run - their load factor. Global average loads started falling in 2007 and coal power CO2 has levelled off since 2014.

It was burned in fireplaces in ancient Rome and in Hopi ovens in what would eventually become the American Southwest. During the industrial revolution, coal was used to power large furnaces and steam engines, necessitating deeper and more dangerous coal mines. Coal production jumped from 10 million tons in 1800 to 250 million tons in 1900.
