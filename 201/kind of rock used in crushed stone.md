Limestone is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). It is the rock type most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. It holds this position because it is widely available and suitable for a greater diversity of uses than any other type of rock. Limestone can be used to make cement.

## Substation Grounding: Role of Crushed Rock - Voltage Disturbance
Crushed rock is useful in reducing step and touch potentials. Resistivity value of crushed rock depends on many factors such as type of locally available material, size of stone, washed vs un-washed stone etc. Washed rocks have less dust and has more resistivity compared to un-washed ones. Removing dust also aids in faster drying time after a rain.
