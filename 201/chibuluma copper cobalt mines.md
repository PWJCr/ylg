## Genesis of sediment-hosted stratiform copper-cobalt deposits, central 
The Neoproterozoic central African Copperbelt is one of the greatest sediment-hosted stratiform Cu-Co provinces in the world, totalling 140 Mt copper and 6 Mt cobalt and including several world-class deposits (⩾10 Mt copper). The origin of Cu-Co mineralisation in this province remains speculative, with the debate centred around syngenetic-diagenetic and hydrothermal-diagenetic hypotheses.

## Proper Copper - Solid Ground : Solid Ground
Copper and cobalt ore have been extracted at Chibuluma since 1955. Metorex mined the Chibuluma East and West ore bodies until their depletion in 2005. In July of that year, Chibuluma South became the first new underground mine to open in the copper belt in 30 years, and it remains the main operating asset on the property today.
