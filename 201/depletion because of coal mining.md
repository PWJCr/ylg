## Chlorofluorocarbon
Chlorofluorocarbon. Chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs) are fully or partly halogenated hydrocarbons that contain carbon (C), hydrogen (H), chlorine (Cl), and fluorine (F), produced as volatile derivatives of methane, ethane, and propane. They are also commonly known by the DuPont brand name Freon .

## Coal | National Geographic Society
Jul 29, 2022Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world, and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.

Comparing these figures with the amount of coal produced, this calculates the carbon release from vegetation owing to coal mining at Xinzhouyao coal mine as 77.568 g/t. Because much of the carbon in lost biomass is recycled to the soil, the biggest impact on the carbon balance of vegetation near coal mines may be attributed to a reduced ability
