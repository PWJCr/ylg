## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
The iron ore extracted in the deposits, mostly by blasting, is initially very coarse and unwieldy, which gives this untreated rock the name coarse ore. After the coarse ore has been extracted, it is crushed directly at the deposits with the aid of cone crushers or jaw crushers to more manageable sizes of approx. 15 mm.
