## Oyster size
Oyster Size. Oysters are available and sold in many different sizes. Most often, the smallest oysters sold weigh about 30 grams, while the largest weigh between 130 and 150 grams. It is the weight that is common among the farmed oysters. Although oysters can well reach more than 150 grams in weight, there is no reason to let them get that big.

## The Life Cycle of Oysters in the Wild - Element Seafood
The rise in temperature triggers oysters to begin spawning, creating reproductive material. The exact temperature varies between species, but it's about 68 F to trigger spawning for the Eastern oyster species. Oysters put a considerable amount of effort into spawning, and in fact, most of the oyster's body will turn into eggs or sperm.

Tilapia Fish. Tilapia is the second most popular type of fish in Nigeria. It is a core ingredient in many Nigerian soups and dishes where it usually appears in the dried or fried form. This is a fish that occupies native status in Nigerian waters, and it is found not only in rivers and streams but in small swamps and natural ponds.
