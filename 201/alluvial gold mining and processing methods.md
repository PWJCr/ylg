## methodes of mining alluvial gold minin
The first stage in alluvial gold mining is to take the dredged river bed material and separate the small sand faction where the gold is found from the larger mineral fraction. In a typical alluvial mining process physical separation methods such as screening and gravity separation are employed to separate the gold from the mineral fraction.

The alluvial gold ore processing method is similar to that of alluvial tin ore. Gold in the alluvial ore is in free state, and most of it is flake or granular. Although the content of gold in alluvial is very low, the specific gravity of gold is heavy, so it is easy to separate from other impurities. In general, the large stones such as gravel

By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed. The mining of alluvial deposits and, later, lode or vein deposits required crushing prior to gold extraction, and this consumed immense amounts of manpower. By ad 100, up to 40,000 slaves were employed in gold mining in Spain.
