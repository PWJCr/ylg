## Barite - Arkansas
Total production of Arkansas barite concentrates is 9 million short tons ( inclusive) - 8 million short tons from the Chamberlain Creek deposit alone valued at ~ 70 million dollars. Reserves of barite in Arkansas are estimated to be in the order of millions of tons, but further mining awaits barite's expanded use.

## Baryte
Baryte, barite or barytes (/ ˈ b ær aɪ t, ˈ b ɛər-/ or / b ə ˈ r aɪ t iː z /) is a mineral consisting of barium sulfate (Ba S O 4). Baryte is generally white or colorless, and is the main source of the element barium.The baryte group consists of baryte, celestine (strontium sulfate), anglesite (lead sulfate), and anhydrite (calcium sulfate). Baryte and celestine form a solid solution

Uses Area. Barite is the main ore of the element barium. It is also important in the manufacture of paper and rubber. Barite is also used in radiology for x-rays of the digestive system. When crushed, it is added to mud to form barium mud, which is poured into oil wells during drilling. A rich, white pigment was once made from crushed Barite.

Barite (barium sulfate, BaSO4) is vital to the oil and gas industry because it is a key constituent of the mud used to drill oil and gas wells. Elemental barium is an additive in optical glass, ceramic glazes, and other products. Within the United States, barite is produced mainly from mines in Nevada.

## Geology and mining history of the Southeast Missouri Barite District 
The Southeast Missouri Barite District and the Valles Mines are located in Washington, Jefferson, and St. Francois Counties, Missouri, where barite and lead ore are present together in surficial and near-surface deposits. Lead mining in the area began in the early 1700's and extended into the early 1900's. Hand mining of lead in the residuum resulted in widespread pits (also called shafts

In the central Missouri region mining of barite is also recorded at an early, though somewhat later, date. In Broadhead's report of 1873 mention is made of a barite grinding plant on Osage river which had been in operation for at least five years previously, and of shipment of ground and raw barite by boat down the river to St. Louis.

May 4, 20217.4. Calculation of the total cost of barite beneficiation. The cost of selecting a ton of barite ore = (electricity fee + labor cost + loader cost) / 80 tons = (300 + 500 + 75) / 80 = 875/80 = 10.9375 RMB. It can be seen that the cost of using this process to sort barite ore is 10.9375 RMB per ton.
