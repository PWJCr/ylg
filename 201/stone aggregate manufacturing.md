## Cast Stone Manufacturing Process - Corinthian Cast Stone
Curing is an integral component to proper Cast Stone fabrication. Although the actual mix designs that Corinthian Cast Stone Inc. uses are proprietary, it is common knowledge that a rich cement/aggregate ratio is normally used in the fabrication of Cast Stone. The matrix achieves its strength through a process called hydration.
