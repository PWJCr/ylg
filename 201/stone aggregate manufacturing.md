Curing is an integral component to proper Cast Stone fabrication. Although the actual mix designs that Corinthian Cast Stone Inc. uses are proprietary, it is common knowledge that a rich cement/aggregate ratio is normally used in the fabrication of Cast Stone. The matrix achieves its strength through a process called hydration.
