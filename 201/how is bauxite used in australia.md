## Bauxite Mining | The Australian Aluminium Council
The first step in producing aluminium is mining this ore. Bauxite occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas, like Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Australia. Australia is the largest producer of bauxite, with five large mines supplying around 30 per cent of global production. Bauxite mining has five steps:

## Bauxite mining in Australia
Uses. Bauxite is a raw material used primarily in the production of aluminium.The bauxite ore is refined into alumina before being smelted into aluminium. Australia is known for its high-grade ore, especially in the Weipa and Gove deposits. The quality of bauxite ore is determined by its available alumina (Al 2 O 3) content.The presence of impurities, which make the ore more difficult to

## how is bauxite used in australia
 Australia is the world""s largest producer of bauxite, with the majority used to produce alumina for the aluminum industry. Non-metallurgical applications such as refractories, proppants, building materials and pharmaceuticals make up around 10% of bauxite""s end uses, however, and many Australian miners are looking at ways to diversify.

## The World's Leading Bauxite Producing Countries - WorldAtlas
Australia . The number one Bauxite producer in the world today is Australia with 81,000 metric tons of bauxite production annually. It is being extracted in five mines that supply seven refineries that supply six smelters, all in Australia.  Today, bauxite is used in many ways such as aluminum-based chemicals, aluminum metal, cements
