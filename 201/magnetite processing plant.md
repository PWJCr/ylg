The above properties are found in magnetite that is why, it is used widely as a heavy media in coal preparation plants all over of the world Magnetite Preparation Process Run of mine magnetite comes in large lumps (0-75 mm). This magnetite is not pure. Its magnetite content is only 50-65%. This is stored and crushed to 0-15 mm size.
