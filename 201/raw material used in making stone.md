The resulting material varies depending on the raw material used in the sintering process. Because of this, there are different classes of stone that are produced using the sintering method.

Trails. Septium are gemstones that align with one of seven elements: Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, Space, Mirage, and Time. Septium is central to the function of Orbal energy, which can power appliances, vehicles, or channel elemental power in the form of "Arts", magical techniques used in combat. Silverstone.

## 8 incredible techniques and processes for working in Stone
Here are 8 different stoneworking techniques and processes, and where you can find them on Make Works. 1. Hand Carving. Before the development of metal carving tools, harder stones were used to shape soft stones like chalk or soapstone. The hand carving process today has remained largely unchanged and remains a physical process - though steel
