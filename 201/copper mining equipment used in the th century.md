## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Innovations: The Butte Copper Mines
In the late 19th century, Montana was the largest producer of copper in the world. However, the mining history of what is now Montana did not begin with copper, but with the discovery of gold. In the mid-1900's, prospectors in the area found gold and silver in placer deposits composed of sand and heavy minerals that eroded from underground rock.

It wasn't until September 17, 1863, that mining operations began. The initial mines were small in caparison but isn't everything small compared to that, and the mining operations didn't really scale up until the late 19 th century when the open pit operations started to take hold. Open-pit mining has its dangers though.

In 1586 Ulrich Fosse, a German who was working the Cumberland copper mines, boasted that he could smelt 560 tons of copper ore in forty weeks.
