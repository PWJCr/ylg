## Effect of Glass Fibers, Fly Ash and Quarry Dust on Strength and 
Replacement of cement is achieved by various replacement levels of 10%, 20% and 30% fly ash and quarry dust. The replacement is made in both individual and combined manner. For evaluating strength and durability characteristics on M20 concrete, compressive strength and porosity tests were carried out.

## Effect of Fly Ash on Mortar Mixes with Quarry Dust as Fine Aggregate
Further when fly ash is partially replaced with cement from 0 to 30% in mortar with 20% quarry dust (QF series), there is an overall increase in strength at 3 days, 7 days, and 28 days of age. The drop in compressive strength due to conversion reaction decreases with increase in fly ash content for a given water to powder ratio.

The use of fly ash in concrete is desirable because of benefits such as useful disposal of a byproduct, increased workability, reduction of cement consumption, increased sulfate resistance, increased resistance to alkali-silica reaction and decreased permeability. However, the use of fly ash leads to a reduction in early strength of concrete. The use of quarry dust in concrete is desirable

## Effect of Fly Ash and Quarry Dust As a Partial Replacement of Cement 
FLY ASH CONTAINS THE BASIC INGREDIENTS OF CEMENT LIKE SILICA, MAGNESIUM AND CALCIUM. CEMENT INDUSTRIES USE FLY ASH TO IMPROVE THE VOLUME. QUARRY DUST ALSO CONTAINS.
