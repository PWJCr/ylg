The choice of milling method will determine the type of machine needed. Face/shoulder or slot milling can be performed in 3-axis machines, while milling 3D profiles require alternatively 4- or 5-axis machines. Turning centres today often have milling capability due to driven tools, and machining centres often have turning capability.
