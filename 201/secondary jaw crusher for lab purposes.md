## Jaw Crushers - MEKA Crushing & Screening Plants
Jaw crushers reduce large rocks or ore by means of compression. Mechanical pressure is applied using the crusher's two jaw; one is fixed while the other makes an eccentric movement. There are also primary and secondary types of these crushers. Jaw crushers are one of the most commonly preferred crushers due to their ability to crush all kinds

## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing? - Eagle Crusher
The degree to which material is reduced through stages of primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing can depend on the type of material, like aggregate, concrete, and asphalt, and can also depend on the variety of output sizes needing produced. Primary crushing is the first stage of material reduction and can sometimes be the only stage needed

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.  This ratio may vary from 1/3 to 1/9, but is generally 1/3 for primary crushers and 1/4 for secondary crushers. θ: Nip
