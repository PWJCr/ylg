## Calcite mining and processing plant
Aug 06, 2021· At present, the iron ore with high industrial value includes the magnetite ore and the hematite ore. The chemical formula of hematite is Fe 2 O 3, and its theoretical TFe content is 70%. Hematite is the most important industrial iron ore in the world, accounting for more than 60% of the total reserves in the iron ore.

## Iron Ores (Hematite and Magnetite) - GeeksforGeeks
Nov 9, 2021An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.

Jul 20, 2022Q.3. How to read the structural formula of organic compounds? Ans: We can read and draw the structural formula by knowing that carbon has four bonds to form and that hydrogen is the most likely atom to be attached to carbon in an organic molecule. Unless otherwise specified, we assume that any vertex between two lines contains a carbon atom.

## Question Video: Writing the Chemical Formula for Hematite
Hematite ore has a high metallic content and can have several different colors. It can be black or brown or even red. We are asked for hematite's formula. Hematite is an iron oxide. That is, it contains iron and oxygen. Specifically, hematite contains, amongst other particles like silica in sand, iron (III) oxide.
