## What is HPC? Introduction to high-performance computing | IBM
High-performance computing (HPC) is a technology that harnesses the power of supercomputers or computer clusters to solve complex problems requiring massive computation. HPC lets users process large amounts of data quicker than a standard computer, leading to faster insights and giving organizations the ability to stay ahead of the competition.

Hui-sheng et al. studied the influence of GGBS on the compressive strength of HPC up to the age of 180 days. GGBS contents were 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 % by weight of cement, with water-binder ratio of 0.30 and 0.35.

Because GGBS has low embodied CO 2, it allows designing concrete mixes for sustainable construction. The manufacture of GGBS requires less than 20% of the energy and produces less than 10% of the CO 2 emissions compared to Portland Cement production. GGBS is a sustainable alternative for Portland Cement in the production of: ready-mix concrete.

## Performance Study On Ggbs Concrete With Robosand
Robosand is manufacturing sand produced from granite stone, has been used as an alternative fine aggregate that completely replaces the river sand which is far superior than river sand in all aspects. Various combination have been made with different proportions of Cement, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag, Robosand, Coarse aggregate and

## Mix Design Methodology for Fly Ash and GGBS-Based  - SpringerLink
The GGBS particles appear to have straight, flaky-elongated shape with sharp-edged angularity, rough surface texture and large variation in size (1-10 μm). The fly ash particles appear to have spherical shape with smooth surface in a broad range of sizes (with the lower limit being approximately 1/10 the maximum fly ash particle size, i.e. 1
