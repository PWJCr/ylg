## Water Tube Boiler: Definition, Types, Advantages, Disadvantages 
The movement of water is much faster than the fire tube boiler because of conventional flow, hence the rate of heat transfer is high which results in higher efficiency. Water boiler: Overall efficiency is up to 90%. In the water boiler: The maximum working pressure is 250 bar or you can say 140 kg/cm2.
