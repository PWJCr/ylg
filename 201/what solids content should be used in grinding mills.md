According to Blaine's theory, these mills can cut up and pour up to 6500 cm2 /g of material. The mill is equipped with an armored lift in the initial part, which uses larger grinding mills with high grinding power.

Grinding mills are size reductions machines that often follow crushers in the processes where finer products are desired after crushing. Different grinding machines are usually named as mills, for example rod mills, ball mills, and attrition mills. Because of the name, verb milling is also been used as a synonym for grinding.
