Mixing the Batter. The batter is mixed in a commercial mixer. Once all the ingredients are combined, the mixer continues to beat the mixture for a further 10 minutes in order to trap in air and allow the cake to rise properly. The air works in conjunction with the added raising ingredient and the cake will grow in size during the baking process.

## Production & Manufacturing Process Flow Charts & Workflow Templates 
The production process, or manufacturing process, consists of a few key components or sub-processes from production planning through quality assurance and inspection of final products. Manufacturing process flow charts, or workflows, can be applied to the manufacturing process to reduce lead times, increase machine utilization and optimize first pass yields.

Jul 14, 2021A batch process involves a set of ingredients and a sequence of one or more production steps that follow a pre-defined order. A set amount of product (s) are produced at the end of each sequence to make up a single batch. The processing of subsequent batches will only begin once all of the set amounts of products have been produced.

## What Is Batch Production? - MRPeasy - Blog for Manufacturers and 
Sep 28, 2021Batch production is a manufacturing method where sets of identical goods go through production stages together, i.e. the production process creates a batch of finished goods at a time. In batch production, individual items do not pass to the next value-added phase until all of the products in the lot have made it through the previous one.

## What is a Process Flow Diagram | Lucidchart
A Process Flow Diagram (PFD) is a type of flowchart that illustrates the relationships between major components at an industrial plant. It's most often used in chemical engineering and process engineering, though its concepts are sometimes applied to other processes as well. It's used to document a process, improve a process or model a new one.

## Batch manufacturing: the right production process for you? - Katana
Aug 17, 2022Batch manufacturing is a style of manufacturing that compiles the different components of a product through step-by-step processes. This basically means that the raw materials move through the production line in batches, so that there is a pause between each step as a batch moves through. That might sound a little abstract, so let's look at
