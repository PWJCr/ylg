## DTI: Dust Control at Concrete Crushing Facilities | BossTek
At concrete crushing facilities, dust is generated at multiple points. Front end loaders, hoppers, and conveyor discharge points all bring dust when operational. Front end loaders transfer the incoming demolition materials to the hopper. Picking up these rocks creates dust as they are disturbed and dumped into the hopper.
