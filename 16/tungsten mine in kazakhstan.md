## Tungsten • Nevada Expeditions
Tungsten Post Office. May 26, 1944 - Oct. 12, 1962. In 1916 or 17, tungsten ore was discovered on the southeastern slope of the Eugene Mountains by Emil Stank. Two 125-ton concentrators were constructed in 1918 by competing companies, the Nevada-Humboldt Tungsten Mine Co. and the Pacific Tungsten Co., and by 1919 the camp of Tungsten formed.

## Tungsten
Tungsten, or wolfram, is a chemical element with the symbol W and atomic number 74. Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively as compounds with other elements. It was identified as a new element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternate name.

## Tungsten | Geoscience Australia
Tungsten occurs as wolframite, which is an iron manganese tungstate mineral ( [Fe,Mn]WO 4 ), and scheelite (CaWO 4 ). Tungsten-bearing deposits occur in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and along the eastern coast of Australia. There is potential for new resource definition and upgrade of existing resources in historical mining areas.

## Construction of the World's Largest Tungsten Mine has Begun
The Sangdong mine, which was historically one of the largest tungsten mines in the world and one of the few long-life, high-grade tungsten deposits outside of China, was acquired in September 2015 through the acquisition of a 100% interest in Woulfe Mining Corp. Almonty owns 100% of the Valtreixal tin-tungsten project in north-western Spain.
