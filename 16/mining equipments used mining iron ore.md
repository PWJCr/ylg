## Ancient Mining Tools and Techniques - Owlcation
In Northern and Northeastern Europe, bogs were the site of bog iron, the earliest form of iron used for tools. Iron compounds from plant decay precipitate out and are deposited at the bog bottom. These nuggets of iron were harvested and smelted to produce mining tools of wrought iron. Some people harvest iron in this manner to this day.

## Iron ore extraction techniques - ScienceDirect
Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed, so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as "dogger") allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting. However, he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip, this

The second half of the mining equipment solution is to line the metal housings with an elastomeric coating. Tough engineering plastics absorb abrasive damage, then pass the shock harmlessly into the metal frame, where it's distributed as process noise. Iron ore processing calls up a whole proprietary range of extractive gear.
