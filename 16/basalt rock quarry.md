Sisk Basalt Hill Quarry for potential production of drain gravel, rock blanket, rockfill, bedding for rip rap, rip rap, and rock blanket materials. The materials would be used to construct dam modifications that would reduce seismic risk to communities located downstream from the dam.

## Skirting in basalt rock quarry - Argonics, Inc.
The basalt rock extracted from the quarry site has less than 20% quartz and has no silica content, but as an aphanitic igneous rock it has fine grain potential. Basalt is not the most abrasive rock, but it still achieves a rating of 23 on the Los Angeles abrasion scale. So there is significant scuffing and wear to maintain on a regular basis.
