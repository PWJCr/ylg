Consolidation's Mine No. 18 in Buxton was probably the largest bituminous coal mine in Iowa. In 1857, coal was being mined from the McCready bank, a site along Bear Creek four miles west of Ottumwa. In 1868, Brown and Godfrey opened a drift mine four miles northwest of town. By 1872, Brown and Godfrey employed 300 men and had an annual

Extensive underground mining occurred in the Centerville area, Appanoose County, Iowa between 1850 and 1971. Coal production was exclusively from the Mystic Coal Member of the Labette Shale (Pennsylvanian). Both longwall and room-and-pillar mining methods were utilized with the longwall method being the predominant type. Although both crater and trough subsidence have occurred in other areas

## Breaker Boys at the Woodward Coal Mines in Kingston  - IDCA
Description. Breaker boys worked in the coal mines. Their main job was to separate chunks of coal by hand. As coal came down the conveyor belt, they would break up the coal into common sized pieces and also separate out any things like rocks, clay and soil. Boys were usually between the ages of 8 to 12, but sometimes were as young as 5 or 6.
