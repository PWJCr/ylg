## How to Make a Concrete Mold | Traditional Concrete Molds and Forms
Concrete contractors also use molds and stamps to make your concrete customizable or give it flair without a lot of extra money. Most concrete molds and stamps are manufactured from metal, wood, rubber, or a combination. They can be built onto large-scale stamps or manufactured onto large drums rolled across wet concrete for a custom look.

## The Relationship of Ferroan Dolomite Aggregate to Rapid Concrete 
Some of Iowa's 13,200 miles of portland cement concrete (pcc) pavement have remained structurally sound for over 50 years while others have suffered premature deterioration. Research has shown that the type of coarse aggregate used in the pcc is the major cause of this premature deterioration. Some coarse aggregates for concrete exhibit a nonuniform performance history.
