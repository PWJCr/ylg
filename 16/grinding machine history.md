## Precision Metal Grinding - Metal Cutting Corporation
In fact, grinding is often considered a subset of cutting, and vice versa, since each grain of abrasive on a grinding wheel acts like a microscopic, sharp cutting edge that shears a tiny chip from a part surface. In general, precision metal grinding processes are used to remove small amounts of material in order to achieve a particular finish

## A Brief History of Milling - GrainMaker
The first American gristmill (which is a mill for grinding grain, especially the customer's own grain) was built in Jamestown in 1621. Prior to that, the Native Americans ground corn by hand usually with a mortar and pestle, as did the very early settlers. In 1631 a gristmill was built in Watertown, Massachusetts, and in 1633 gristmills were

We owe the first milling machine in history to Eli Whitney. As with many inventions, the first milling machine was designed in a period of armed conflict. In 1789, the U.S. government asked the Connecticut inventor Eli Whitney to make a large quantity of firearms, since war with France was imminent.

## A Brief History of Milling - GrainMaker
By 170 B.C., bread baking had become a profession in Rome. It is thought that the Romans were the first to have started a milling industry using animals or teams of slaves to drive the wheels to grind the wheat. Before this, grinding of meal had mostly been carried out in the home using a device called a hand-quern.
