Mechanical Gyroscope. The working principle of the mechanical gyroscope is based on the conservation of angular momentum. This is also one of the most commonly known gyroscopes. The mechanical gyroscope is dependent on the ball bearing to spin. These gyroscopes are replaced with modern forms of gyroscopes as they are noisier.

A gyroscope is a sensor for measuring an angular rate or angle based on the principles of angular momentum Early gyroscopes eg, ball electrostatic and ring laser gyroscopes were generally large with poor portability For several decades, micro-gyroscopes based on MEMS Micro electro mechanical systems technology have

## mechanical construction of mems gyroscope
Design and Mechanical Sensitivity Analysis of a MEMS  The amplification mechanism has been applied to MEMS resonant output gyroscope (ROG) and MEMS accelerometer due to the force or displacement amplification effects [31,32]. The focus of this paper is on how to improve the mechanical sensitivity of a MEMS gyroscope by using a leverage

## Mechanical-thermal noise in MEMS gyroscopes | Semantic Scholar
We derive expressions for the effect of mechanical thermal noise on a vibrational microelectromechanical system gyroscope, including the angle of random walk, the noise equivalent rotation rate, and the spectral density of the noise component of the rate measurement. We explicitly calculate and compare the output signal due to rotation and the output due to noise.

## MEMS Gyroscope Manufacturers | FOG Gyros for UAV, ROV, AUV
The basic mechanical gyroscope design consists of a spinning wheel mounted on an axle that is free to assume any orientation, with the entire construct mounted on a gimbal.  MEMS Gyroscopes and Fiber Optic Gyros. Gyroscopes may also be based around other operating principles. MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) gyroscopes utilise the
