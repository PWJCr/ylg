## What is Portland cement process of Manufacturing,Dry and Wet
The wet process for the manufacturing of Portland cement. In the wet process, limestone is first crushed to smaller fragments. Then, it takes to ball or tube mill where it mixes with clay and finely ground. Then, water adds to it to make a slurry. It pumps to slurry tanks, where it keep in an agitated condition by means of rotating arm or by

They are mixed either dry (dry mixing) or by water (wet mixing). 3) Prepared raw mix is fed into the rotary kiln. 4) As the materials pass through the kiln their temperature is rised upto °C. The process of heating is named as "burning". The output is known as "clinker" which is 0.15-5 cm in diameter.

## What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement 
The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material, such as limestone, clay or iron ore, in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln, whereas no water is added in the dry process. Instead, the raw material is fed into the kiln in its dry state.

Dry process cement production kiln is the typical kiln type during the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. It is a big step for haft kiln. Because of its less than 1% water content dust raw materials, it reduces the most needed heat for evaporating water. So, it needs less time than wet process cement production.
