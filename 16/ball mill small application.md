The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%

Crushed ore is fed to the ball mill through the inlet; a scoop (small screw conveyor) ensures the feed is constant. For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%).
