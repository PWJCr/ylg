## Working Principle of Bead mill
Bead Mill - Working Principle. The bead mill consists of a horizontal grinding chamber, which in turn houses the shaft and agitator discs. The chamber is filled with zirconium grinding media and the material leakage is prevented by the double acting mechanical seal. The material is pumped into the chamber using a air operated diaphragm pump or

## Component Of Ball Mill And Its Working Principle
The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide. 5/22/2019 The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.

Moreover, it has good operating characteristics with an efficiency as high as 90%. An induction motor does not have any commutator, like the one we saw in a DC motor. Hence it provides a good speed regulation without any sparking. So, with that many advantages, it becomes essential to meet the mechanical power demand using an induction motor.

## Component Of Ball Mill And Its Working Principle
The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body ball and the object to be polished material installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.
