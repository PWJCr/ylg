Compared to underground mining methods, the open pit mining method requires removing significant amount of overburden from the pit and moving it outside the mine.  The most common types of failure include plane failure, wedge failure, toppling failure, and circular failure.  Martin R. Open Pit Mine Planning and Design—Volume 1

## 20.1 Metal Deposits - Physical Geology
Mining and Mineral Processing. Metal deposits are mined in a variety of different ways depending on their depth, shape, size, and grade. Relatively large deposits that are quite close to the surface and somewhat regular in shape are mined using open-pit mine methods (Figure 20.1). Creating a giant hole in the ground is generally cheaper than making an underground mine, but it is also less

Roof support at the face (the area where coal is actively mined) is intended to hold the immediate roof above the coal face. In modern mechanized mines, roof bolting is the most common method employed. Steel bolts, usually 1.2 to 2 metres long and 15 to 25 millimetres in diameter, are inserted in holes drilled into the roof by an electric rotary drill and are secured by either friction or resin.

Open-Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, one of the most common forms, is one of the most damaging. Miners hollow out a section of land, digging down to create a workable area and extract valuable raw materials. This method leaves behind large pits in the earth and can contaminate the groundwater with chemicals used in the mining process.

## MINING Equipment List Mining Tools Names + Underground + Open pit
What is open pit mining? Open pit mining is the most common mining technology when it comes to new mines. In this technique, the soil is excavated and the mineral separation and the remaining soil material occurs on the surface. The first step in this process is the extraction of the ore (beta with high mineral grade).

Either ore or waste can be stored in the stope. A flatter seam can be worked than in underhand stoping without the necessity of shoveling, as the ore runs directly down the pitch and is given an impetus by the blast. Water takes care of itself. Pillars of ore or waste can be left easily.

Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.

## Environmental Risks of Mining - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Open pit mining. Open pit mining, where material is excavated from an open pit, is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations, which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.

## Mining Tools in 2022—A Guide to Mining Equipment and  - Flyability
Open pit mining. Open-pit mining is a technique that involves drilling into the earth's surface to set explosives. These explosions create a large pit for miners to access underlying rocks. This surface mining technique can be used to extract silver. Quarrying. Quarrying is a process in which miners cut blocks of hard stone.
