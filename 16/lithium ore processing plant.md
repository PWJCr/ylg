## The beneficiation of lithium minerals from hard rock ores: A review
Processing of lithium ore, like most minerals, begins with beneficiation prior to extraction of its compounds in downstream processes.  For example, a leading electric car manufacturer is constructing a lithium-ion battery plant in Nevada capable of producing up to 500,000 lithium-ion vehicle batteries per year (US Geological Survey, 2017

Lithium Ore Processing As mentioned above, the lithium extraction process uses a lot of freshwater — as much as 500,000 gallons per metric ton. To extract lithium, miners drill a hole in salt flats and pump brine up to the surface. Months go by, the water evaporates and leaves a mixture of minerals and lithium salts.

Lithium is historically known to be produced from two sources: brines and hard rock mining. Lithium produced from brines is a cost-efficient process. Also, Lithium is processed from brine, spodumene, and clay. Salar brines are underground reservoirs that contain high concentrations of dissolved salts, such as lithium, potassium, and sodium.

## Construction to resume at Kwinana lithium hydroxide processing plant 
The Kwinana plant will have an output capacity of 48,000 tonnes per year of battery grade lithium hydroxide upon completion, to be achieved in two stages each of 24,000 tpy. Tianqi had originally planned for the the first phase to production in the fourth quarter of 2022. No new timeline has been shared for the plant's productions schedule.
