##  Modern Processing Techniques to minimize cost in Cement Industry
Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) The power used for the actual grinding process while grinding raw materials, depends mainly on the hardness of raw materials and the type of mill used, i.e. ball mill or vertical roller mill. Typically, the motor of the ball mill consumes about 14 - 15 kWh/ ton of raw mix whereas the VRM motor

## Effective Ways to Reduce Rolling Mill Roller Consumption
Reducing rolling mill roller energy consumption can effectively reduce the production cost and increase the benefit. At the same time, it can effectively improve the mill operation rate and ensure the surface quality of hot rolled products. In the production of the hot-rolled strip steel, the consumption of roll is especially huge.

## Cement mill
A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
