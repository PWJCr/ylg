## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Cement Concrete
Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions, and the strength of the aggregate used in road construction is expressed by numerical index. Aggregates with lower crushing value show a lower

Materials Required For WBM Road  In WBM road, wearing coarse is made by crushing aggregates with filler material mechanically by heavy compaction. It uses sand as a filler material. This wearing coarse is laid on the base course. WBM road is the first choice for road construction in rural areas. WBM road is the most used road in rural areas.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
This crushed road, which is essentially crushed stone, then becomes the base for the new road. Due to a lack of reporting, the exact amount of crushed stone recycling is unknown. Much of the crushed stone is also recycled right on the construction site, especially with road construction, and this makes it difficult to measure.
