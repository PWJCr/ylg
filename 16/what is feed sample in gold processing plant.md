## Strategies For Optimisation of Gold Processing Plants
For efficient stripping of gold, from activated carbon, reversing the above is logical. Thus successful elution should be favoured by high temperature, high free cyanide, high pH, low ionic strength and the absence of calcium. This is an excellent starting point to commence elution optimisation.

X-ray fluorescence sample preparation. Fusion is the most accurate method of sample preparation for X-ray fluorescence analysis of oxides. Fusing oxide materials removes both grain size and mineralogical effects in powders and inhomogeneous samples. This preparation method heats a mixture of the sample with a borate (or similar) flux in a gas.

## Monument adding BIOX and ASTER to gold process at Selinsing
The basic gold processing plant design and FEED form a major part of the feasibility study. It is aimed to convert the existing oxide gold treatment processing plant to a sulphide treatment gold processing plant. As a result, it would allow additional flotation process and BIOX® process to be added to the existing plant with certain

At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bio-leach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range, so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price, but in the current gold price and cost
