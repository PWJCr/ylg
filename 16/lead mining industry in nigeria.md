## Petroleum industry in Nigeria
Nigeria is one of the largest oil and gas producers in Africa. Crude oil from the Niger delta basin comes in two types: light, and comparatively heavy - the lighter around 36 gravity and the heavier, 20-25 gravity. Both types are paraffinic and low in sulfur. Nigeria's economy and budget has been largely supported from income and revenues generated from the petroleum industry since 1960.
