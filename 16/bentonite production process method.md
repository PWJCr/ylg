Drying Bentonite. Bentonite, as mined, typically contains between 25-35% moisture and requires drying to 5% to 12%. This is often accomplished through the use of a rotary drum dryer. While drying can be a fairly straightforward task in mineral processing, bentonite requires special attention, as overdrying risks diminished performance of the clay.

Methane fermentation is an attractive practice in waste processing, which enables us to both control pollution and recover energy. As reported by Scarlat et al, 17 in 2015, in Europe alone, there were about 17 000 biogas plants of different sizes and types, and the total biogas production reached more than 650 PJ of primary energy. Biogas production has achieved an important growth recently.
