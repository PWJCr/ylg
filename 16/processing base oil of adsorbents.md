## Strategies for gas treatment with adsorbents - DigitalRefining
Article Summary. Adsorbents are widely used for contaminant removal in natural gas treatment. Special materials, such as molecular sieves, are used to remove sulphur-containing impurities like mercaptans, as well as water. Such operation may be prone to problems, particularly during the regeneration of these molecular sieves.

## Asphalt
Asphalt, also known as bitumen (UK: / ˈ b ɪ tj ʊ m ɪ n /, US: / b ɪ ˈ tj uː m ə n, b aɪ-/), is a sticky, black, highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch.Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos.

## Base oil
Base oils are used to manufacture products including lubricating greases, motor oil and metal processing fluids.Different products require different compositions and properties in the oil. One of the most important factors is the liquid's viscosity at various temperatures. Whether or not a crude oil is suitable to be made into a base oil is determined by the concentration of base oil

## Using Adsorbents to Mitigate Biodiesel Influence on the Deterioration 
This study focused on using adsorbents to suppress engine oil deterioration as a result of the influ - ence of biodiesel. Engine oil performance is affected by the use of biodiesel that results in short period of oil drain interval. Neat base oil, 80% blended with biodiesel, 20% was thermo oxidatively aged.
