## The Pros and Cons of Manufactured Sand - The Screed Scientist®
Sand dredging is heavily taxed/ banned in many parts of the world. Growing demand for fine-aggregates in construction: Nearly 65-80% of the volume of concrete and screed mixes is made up of sand/aggregates. The UK market alone requires an approximate 200 Million Tonnes of aggregates every year for various construction purposes.

Recycled aggregates (RA) from construction and demolition waste (CDW) instead of natural aggregates (NA) were analysed in the manufacture of new eco-friendly concrete. Fine (FRA) and coarse (CRA) recycled aggregates were used in different percentages as substitutes of natural sand and gravel, respectively. The results revealed that the use of RA in percentages of up to 50 wt.% is feasible

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Manufacture Of Sand
Sand: Product of the disintegration of rocks over long periods of time. Most sand casting operations use silica sand (SiO 2). A great advantage of sand in manufacturing applications is that sand is inexpensive. Another advantage of sand to manufacture products by metal casting processes, is that sand is very resistant to elevated temperatures.

We accept clean yard waste, manures and food scraps. We use these materials to make high. Composting is a naturally occurring process. It starts as leaves, branches, fruit, and plants fall to the floor of their ecosystem.
