The backwash frequency is the same as filter run time. Either term can be used to signify the number of hours between backwashing. The backwash period is the length of time which backwashing lasts. The backwash water is the water used to backwash the filter. For the filters we're considering, backwash water should be 1-5% of the water filtered during the filter run.
