Coke Making Process. Coal is crushed and blended prior to being charged in a coke oven. A larry car charges the individual oven with the blended coal. In the coke oven, the coal is heated to 1,800°F for up to 18 hours. During that time, the volatiles of the coal are driven into the offgas and a pure carbon form called "coke" remains. Contact us
