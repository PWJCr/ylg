Locate the coolant expansion tank in the engine bay. As you open the hood, look at the left of the engine bay. This is the typical coolant expansion reservoir location. Some BMW models, such as the 3-series, have the coolant expansion reservoir on the engine bay's right side. Remove the coolant reservoir cap. Turn it slowly counterclockwise.

Check out some of the things that can cause an empty coolant reservoir to occur. 1. You Have a Hole in Your Radiator. Your car's radiator obviously plays a big role in your car's cooling system. It's also under a lot of pressure at almost all times, which can cause it to suffer from normal wear and tear.

Read on, to find out. 1. Pressure Build Up. When you overfill the coolant reservoir, there won't be much space left for the heated coolant to expand. As a result of which, the pressure inside the reservoir would increase gradually. When this happens, the cap of the tank will open, and the hot coolant would pop out like a puddle of lava.

## Why is my coolant overflow at the cap after driving? - Quora
Answer (1 of 4): Because when you add a little too much coolant, the system is designed to release any extra coolant and keep what is needed. There is a pressure relief valve that allows this to happen when pressure builds up in the reservoir. Very normal.

The water pump takes water throughout the cooling system and around the radiator. It also maintains water at the optimal temperature and cools it down when it gets hot. A failing water pump will cause the engine to overheat, resulting in damage. Equally important is that the water pump lasts for 60,000 to 90,000 miles.

## Oil in Coolant Reservoir: Causes and Troubleshooting - CAR FROM JAPAN
A broken or damaged head gasket is the prime cause of oil getting in the coolant. You can find this head gasket beside the engine block. It maintains the proper level of air pressure and prevents the engine oil from leaking. However, an overheated engine can blow this head gasket, which results in oil leakage in the coolant reservoir.

Bubbling indicates rising air pressure in the cooling system, which is a sign that the flow of liquid is blocked by a pocket of air. One of the most common causes is a blown head gasket, in which the air pressure inside the cylinder heads is transferred to the cooling system. This escaped air causes bubbling in the coolant/antifreeze reservoir

4 Situations in which a car loses water. The loss of water in the underside of the vehicle can be an indication that the vehicle has some type of fault. Faced with this situation, it is essential to determine if, in effect, the car loses water due to a breakdown and, in that case, assess whether the vehicle can circulate.

Most common causes of water leaking from under a car. Some of the most common causes of a water leak are the exhaust, the cooling system, and the windscreen washer system. If you see a clear and odorless fluid under your car, then it's possibly just water from your car's AC system. The air conditioning system of your car is the most common

The other system that uses a water-based fluid is your engine's cooling system. If your car is leaking water, then this system is most likely the culprit. Your cooling system is the most common leak source because it is a pressurized system. The high pressure can force coolant out even the smallest of leaks.

A damaged reservoir tank can cause evaporation of the coolant; it is the cause of the coolant reservoir not filling up. The drop rate in the level of coolant depends on the extent of the damage. The coolant level also decreases with time as you use the engine of your car, so you can try refilling the reservoir and observing for faults.

## Overheating and boiling coolant in reservoir and more!
Start the car, and rev it to about 2k rpm, watch, add coolant as needed, ect. Vary the rpms, let it go down to idle, all the time making sure there is still coolant. If it starts to overheat at any point, obviously turn it off. Secondly, resist the urge to put any sort of stop leak product in.

## The heater will not work well if the system is too low though. 3. Dirty 
The most common consequence of driving with a low engine coolant is air in the cooling system, resulting in an overheating engine. I have no heat, and this is a problem because its winter!  This system includes multiple components: a radiator, a water pump, an overflow reservoir, thermostat, temperature sensor, hoses and channels in the

## What You Should Know about Your Coolant Reservoir - BlueDevil Products
The coolant reservoir tank offers temporary refuge for the coolant when it expands as a result of engine heat. When the engine cools and the heat is dispelled from the coolant, it slips out of the plastic reservoir tank and into the radiator. The coolant reservoir doesn't actually do anything: it just sits there, ever ready to perform its

## Reservoirs - Drinking Water
Reservoirs provide steady water supply that can be managed with certainty. Reservoirs can meet demand with resources acquired over the course of the year when water demand increases, such as during the spring agricultural boom. Hydro-electric power is commonly generated from dammed reservoirs on a large enough scale to appeal to many policymakers.
