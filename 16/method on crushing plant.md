##  Scientific Methods to Design Crushing and Screening Plants
crushing and screening is a most fruitful area for achieving economies in overall mill performance. In order to realize how gains can be made, it is necessary to look into the power relationships within a crushing plant. Towards a Definition of "Crusher Power Rate" To reduce a material's size, work has to be done on it.

Here are eight tips to make that happen. 1. Set up the plant at the right time. The best season to set up a crushing plant is in the fall. The weather is typically temperate enough for crews to work consistently, unlike summer or winter, which can pose dangers from the heat or cold. Spring can work as well but in areas such as the east coast

## How do you control dust in a crushing plant?
Crusher dust is a type of fine dust, which contains very small 0-5mm aggregate particles as well as sand. It is formed as a by-product from mining operations and is often recycled for different applications such as construction. Whenever rocks are crushed by rock crushing equipment, tiny PM 1, PM 2.5 and PM 10 dust particles spread through the air.

In a cone-type crusher the work done on the stone is performed by the mantle and concave (Fig. 1). The amount of reduction that can be achieved is controlled by two major mechanical factors within the crushing chamber: first, the conical angle, shape, and length ofthe chamber; and second, the eccentricity and operating speed of the mantle.

There are four basic mechanical methods to reduce a material - by compression, impact, attrition, or shear - and most crushers employ a combination of all these crushing methods. Compression. Crushers that employ the forces of compression squeeze material between two surfaces, one stationary and the other moving, in order to achieve size reduction.
