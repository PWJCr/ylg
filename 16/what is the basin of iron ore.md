## Why Is Iron Ore Valuable? Behind the Scenes of Production (+ Top Uses 
Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world's iron is used to produce steel. Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish-white metal. Other than meteorites that fall from the sky, iron is never found by itself in nature. Most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements.

The article is dedicated to the geological structure and spatial position of the Cimmerian Kerch-Taman iron ore basin. Based on paleogeographic and recent geochemical data, it is shown that iron accumulated in the Cimmerian brackish lake originated mostly from weathered old rocks of the Ukrainian shield. The metal in question was delivered to the basin by its multistage migration and

## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters. The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and
