## background of limestone mining and mineral processing
Mining and mineral-processing industries producing lithium minerals, metals, and salts contribute to the lithium burden in the environment. The processing of lithium-containing minerals such as spodumene, in general, comprises crushing, wet grinding in a ball mill, sizing, gravity concentration, and flotation using a fatty acid (oleic acid) as

In 2017, mining contributed R334.7 billion or 8 percent to gross domestic product from R306.2 billion in 2016 an increase of R28.4 billion. The increase in production and value addition by mining can be attributed to the recovery in prices of commodities. The improved commodity prices brought the mining industry back into profitability.

These minerals are also referred to as "nonfuel minerals" or "industrial minerals". The most common noncoal mines in Pennsylvania produce "aggregate" (hard granular material used in concrete, mortar, plaster, blacktop). The types of rock used for these purposes are limestone/ dolomite, sandstone and argillite.
