## Alloy steel
Alloy steel is steel that is alloyed with a variety of elements in total amounts between 1.0% and 50% by weight to improve its mechanical properties.Alloy steels are broken down into two groups: low alloy steels and high alloy steels. The difference between the two is disputed. Smith and Hashemi define the difference at 4.0%, while Degarmo, et al., define it at 8.0%.

## Conveyor Belt Material | History & Creation of Conveyor Belts - SEMCOR
Steel belts came along in 1902, and underground conveyor belts followed shortly after that in 1905. Once Henry Ford famously used a conveyor belt system in his assembly line in 1913, belts began gaining a lot more attention. Changes and developments came in spades. By 1970, the first plastic conveyor belt had arrived. 2.

## Stainless Steel Conveyor Belt Tracking Solutions
Tracking issues are typically caused by: Poor system alignment. Uncontrolled pulley shaft deflection. Differential loading. Belt camber (edge bow, or the deviation of a belt edge from a straight line) Every type of conveyor belt has some camber. Stainless steel belts typically have a camber of less than 0.050" (1.27 mm) in 8' (2.44 mm).

## Roller Chains and Sprockets - Construction of Chain & Sprocket
The chain is the main member in a chain drive made up by means of links interlocked by pins and rollers of specific diameter. The pins are arranged in a series at accurately timed intervals or pitch in order to match the pitch distance in the sprocket. The sprocket is normally made of alloy steel and is tempered and case hardened at the tooth area in order to enhance the wear resistance of the

## Steel cord conveyor belts - Metso Outotec
A typical carcass with 7 x 7 hot-galvanised steel cords provides a tensile strength of up to 2,000 N/mm. Also available as 7 x 19 for higher tensile strength (10 000 N/mm). Standard cords have an elongation of 0.22 - 0.28%. High structural strength and pull-out strength ensure good resistance against fatigue.
