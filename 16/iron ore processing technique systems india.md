## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys.The earliest surviving prehistoric iron artifacts, from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt, were made from meteoritic iron-nickel. It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began, but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores in the region from Greece to India, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Iron Ore Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In India, where iron ore processing is one of the major industries, the generation of tailings is estimated to be 10-25 % of the total iron ore mined, amounting to 18 million tons per year (Das et al., 2000 ). The tailings contain silica in high percentage (40-60 %, from various locations). This makes it a suitable raw material for the
