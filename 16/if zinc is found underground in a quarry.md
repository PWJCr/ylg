Pure zinc is a bluish-white, shiny metal which is resistant to corrosion. Zinc has never been found naturally in its pure form. It can be alloyed (mixed) with a number of other metals. Zinc is brittle at ordinary temperatures but is malleable and ductile (can be beaten and drawn into a wire) when heated to 1000°C.
