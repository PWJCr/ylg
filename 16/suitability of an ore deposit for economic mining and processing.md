## Mineral Deposit Value - How to Calculate the Potential Value of a 
Before you can calculate the potential mineral deposit value, you first need to gather some specific data regarding the ore body and the individual drill results.. This required data can be found in the mining company's press releases in which they announce their drill results.Make sure that this data is announced according to the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101 (i.e. approved by a

## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Open-pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface. If the deposit apexes below the surface, the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open-pit mining. The removal of this material is known as stripping. The stripping-pit limits must be extended beyond the

Economic viability of ore deposits. Many factors control the economic viability of an ore deposit but the most important are: grade (i.e. amount of metal per ton of rock) size of the deposit (i.e. tonnage) easy access to infrastructure such as roads and rail for transportation; current price for the commodity; demand; Oxidised zones of ore deposits

Mining, handling and processing low-grade ore in mining and mineral processing operations is resulting in higher costs and lower profits. While this is a widely acknowledged issue, solutions have so far been limited.

## Geology: What is a Mineral Deposit? — Mining Focus
A mineral deposit is a natural concentration of minerals in the earth's crust. The degree of concentration is called the "grade" of a mineral deposit. An "ore deposit" is a mineral deposit which has high enough grades of metal that makes it economic to mine. Essentially this means that per tonne of rock containing the desired minerals, the

The Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) is an intermediate step in the engineering process to evaluate the technical and economic viability of a mining project. The pre-feasibility study is a critical step for project development as it represents the minimum prerequisite for conversion of a geologic resource into a reportable reserve.

## The Four Main Methods of Mining - OreFlow
In-situ mining (also called in-situ leaching or recovery) is a mining method that's used to obtain minerals like uranium and copper through drilled boreholes into a deposit. In-situ mining works by dissolving naturally occurring minerals that are in a solid state. A leaching solution is pumped into the boreholes where it makes contact with the ore.

## Columbite Ore Mining And Processing In Nigeria, The Pre-Feasibility 
Burkina Faso and Mali have also become strong mining countries. Following the global economic recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s, developing countries started liberalizing their external trade to improve balance of payment, increase economic growth through the provision of incentives to attract capital in-flow and investment.

## Making the grade: understanding exploration results
As a rule of thumb, open pit mining can process ore for $10 per tonne and, where the ore grade is more than double that at $20 per tonne, results would be economic. Consider that 1% of a metric
