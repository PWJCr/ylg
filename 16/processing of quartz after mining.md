The processing of the quartz crystal depends on the amount, origin and the type of impurities present in the ore. After the quartz is successfully mined, it must go through a series of steps to remove its flaws.The process includes crushing, screening, floating and other chemical techniques. They can be classified into four to six stages:

1) Extraction Of Quartz Quartz can be extracted through open-pit mining. There are some rare instances that miners have to use explosives when it is necessary for them to expose the deep seam of the mineral. But it is done rarely because regardless of its hardness, it can be easily damaged when exposed to a sudden change in temperatures.

Processing Once quartz is mined it must undergo an extensive cleaning process to strip off physical flaws or chemical impurities. After being cleaned, the quartz is screened and then crushed into various sizes depending on its future use. Quartz goes through a process of being crushed by a crusher and then it is separated by a vibrating screen.
