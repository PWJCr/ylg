## The Real Cost of Mining Gold | Kitco Commentary
The Real Cost of Mining Gold. Since the bull market for gold began in 2003, the world's major gold mining companies have produced tens of millions of ounces of gold and have raised (and written-off) many billions of dollars for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Despite a gold price that appreciated from $344 to $1260 an ounce from 2003
