## The Beneficiation Process of 80 Tons Per Hour Barite Ore in Hubei
7.4. Calculation of the total cost of barite beneficiation. The cost of selecting a ton of barite ore = (electricity fee + labor cost + loader cost) / 80 tons = (300 + 500 + 75) / 80 = 875/80 = 10.9375 RMB. It can be seen that the cost of using this process to sort barite ore is 10.9375 RMB per ton.

The density of manganese oxide ore is generally about 3.7~3.9t/m3, which is significantly different from silicate type gangue. Commonly used gravity separators include mineral jigs, shaker table, cyclones, chutes, and the like. The density of manganese carbonate ore is 3.3~3.6t/m3, which has a small difference from the density of gangue.

Manganese (Mn) is the twelfth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Amongst some 300 minerals containing manganese, only about a dozen are of economic significance. Manganese is a silvery-gray metal that resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic.

## Manganese beneficiation, plant, processing, machinery, manufacturer 
Manganese metal is frequently produced by preparing a solution of manganous sulfate from ore that has been reduction roasted, and electrolyzing is a typical production process of manganese metal from ore. Manganese ore is roasted to reduce the higher oxides to manganese oxide. Slag from the production of high carbon ferromanganese may also
