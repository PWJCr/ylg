Mining in Egypt has had a long history that dates back to predynastic times.Active mining began in Egypt around 3000 BCE. Egypt has substantial mineral resources, including 48 million tons of tantalite (fourth largest in the world), 50 million tons of coal, and an estimated 6.7 million ounces of gold in the Eastern Desert. The total real value of minerals mined was about LE 102 million (US$18.

## Coal Mining - Encyclopedia of Arkansas
As production increased, it became difficult to mine the remaining coals near to the surface, and therefore underground methods were developed.One underground method was the use of slope mines, whereby the mining followed the slope of the natural coal bed, gathering and extracting the coal as the slope shaft continued to follow the coal bed.

## Coal Miners - West Virginia
Coal mining is a dangerous job requiring skill and judgment. In the hand-loading era, an underground miner's workplace, usually called a "room," was only as high as the coal seam. A room in the Pocahontas seam could be more than 10 feet high, while workplaces in the Kanawha and New River seams often were no taller than four feet.
