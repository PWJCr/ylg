## Limestone Screening Or Sand Paver Base - DIY Home Improvement Forum
4,113 Posts. #2 Â· Sep 14, 2008 (Edited) Who in the world would recommend as sand base. You use the same material for base that you would use for an asphalt pavement. You cannot compact sand unless it is dirty. Over the base, which must be compacted AND properly graded, you put in a 1" sand setting bed. - The sand is uncompacted and screeded.

## Stop Using Limestone Screenings / Crusher Dust / Stone Dust for Pavers 
When comparing stone dust vs sand, this sand is definitely an acceptable material to use under pavers. It provides drainage, wont eat away at the pavers, and it compacts well. With the compaction of the pavers, the sand will work its way into the joints of the pavers from below creating that interlock that is required in an interlocking system.
