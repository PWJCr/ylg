Increasing drainage in plant pots is key in preventing overwatered soil and the ill effects it can have on plants.

When rocks are placed at the bottom of a plant pot, the saturated zone becomes adjacent to the soil surface and reaches the roots.

Now you're heating the roots, plus suffocating and killing off the soil under the plastic. Trees and shrubs mulched with rock never thrive.

The border should be at least 3 inches high to keep the roots of plants, grasses and weeds
