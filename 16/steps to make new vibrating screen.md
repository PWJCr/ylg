## Installation steps of vibrating screen exciter | Haiside
A vibration exciter must be installed on the mine vibrating screen equipment to realize the screening of materials. The vibrating screen exciter is a device used to generate the exciting force, which can make the object to be excited obtain a certain form and magnitude of vibration, thereby vibrating the object. In addition to providing exciting force, the exciter also determines the vibration

## Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings
