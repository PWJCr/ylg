## Method of Reducing Wear and Tear of Jaw Crusher in Use
In the jaw crusher structure, wear often occurs, especially in the lower 1/3, the wear situation is more prominent. The wear of the dynamic and static frontal plates can cause the crusher to fail to operate normally and lose the crushing ability. There will be wear and tear in the crusher during its working process, which can be reduced and unavoidable.

## Jaw Crusher - ScienceDirect
The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.
