## Sand
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size. Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.. The composition of sand varies, depending on the

## What Is Beach Sand Made Out Of - Realonomics
The most common component of sand is silicon dioxide in the form of quartz. The Earth's landmasses are made up of rocks and minerals including quartz feldspar and mica. Weathering processes — such as wind rain and freezing/thawing cycles — break down these rocks and minerals into smaller grains. What type of sand is beach sand?

Though many types of sand on the market may contain some silica, overall, the sand must contain at least 95 percent silicon dioxide in order to be labeled as silica sand. In some cases, it's also called quartz sand since quartz is also made of silicon dioxide. Silica sand may also contain small amounts of silt, dust, or salts.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
