## Replacing natural sand by crushed rock in concrete using nonlinear 
There is a lot of pressure to stop using natural sand and instead use crushed rock or recycled aggregate in concretes. However, crushed rock tends to have sharp corners, which affect not only the rheology of fresh concrete, but they also affect the strength of hardened concrete. So it is not possible to add large amounts of crushed rock easily.

Unstabilized, loose crushed concrete has all the downsides that loose gravel does. It spreads and thins easily, requiring you to add more and to constantly even out your driveway so it doesn't develop bare spots and ruts. Crushed concrete also creates dust rather easily, which can stick to your vehicles and dirty them.
