Iron-rich powder is then mixed with water and clay into a slurry that is shaped into pellets, heated, dried, and shipped to steel mills. The pulverized waste rock—known as tailings —is loaded into water-filled retention basins, where it eventually settles to the bottom and re-enters the rock cycle.

## A Underground Method of Mining Iron Ore
Rock-filling is now being used in the ninth level, from which 130,000 tons of ore, it is estimated, will be mined this year. The drawings, Figs. 5, 6 and 7, show the method of this filling. From the main shaft " A," a drift cuts the ore-body and 25 feet into the foot-wall of firm jasper-slates.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Lithium Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries. It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl (Si2O 5) 2, lepidolite K (Li,Al) 3 (Al,Si,Rb) 4 O 10 (F,OH) 2, spodumene LiAl (SiO 3) 2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world's largest producers of lithium.
