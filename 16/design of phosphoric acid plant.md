## Phosphoric acid - Essential Chemical Industry
Phosphoric acid. Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is taken up by plant roots, usually as the dihydrogenphosphate ion, H 2 PO 4-, derived from phosphoric acid, H 3 PO 4. The manufacture of fertilizers that are used to rectify phosphorus deficiencies in soils depends on the availability of supplies of phosphoric acid.

Muratic acid or HCl is a bit too harsh on galvanized metal. It does little to remove rust, but goes after the Iron and Zinc metals.

## Audit of Cooling Tower in Phosphoric Acid Plant - Blogger
In this plant the cooling water was used for direct process cooling i.e. it was coming in contact with process gases for their cooling. So the pH of CW was very low at ~1-2. This was causing many problems in terms of failure of mechanical components leading to vibration problems & vary high approach of 11Â°C compared to design value of 3.9Â°C.
