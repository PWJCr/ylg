## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Challenges Facing the Concrete Industry - NBM&CW
The sustainability of concrete construction is the first challenge facing the industry. Concrete solutions are often the most sustainable and have the potential for a very long service life, but because concrete is used in vast quantities, its use does have a global impact.

Production begins with weighing process. A number of additives can be put into the concrete. They are classified by different names such as chemical, air entraining, fine-grained. Very important is given to the non-leakage of molds. After enough mixing with the mixer, the process ends. Then the shipping process begins.
