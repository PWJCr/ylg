## What Is Impact Milling? | Highwood Crossing Foods Ltd.
The "hammers" strike the whole grain in mid-air with such an impact that the grain is immediately shattered into flour. There is no friction from heat-creating stones or rollers. Temperature is the key factor here. An impact mill maintains a low temperature of about 15 C in the cooler months and up to about 30 C in the summer.

## Guide to Grain Mills - Grit
Grain mills come in two types: the electric impact mill that bursts the grain open, and the burr mill, which rubs the grain between two wheels of stone or stainless steel. Neither mill is better than the other; they just operate differently and perform different tasks. It's important to know what your purposes are before purchasing a mill.

Stone-ground grits need from 25 to 45 minutes of simmering time. The amount of time is a personal preference, as some people like them more crunchy while others like the creamy texture grits get after simmering for 45 minutes. 7. Remember 1 to 4. The ratio of grits to liquid in cooking stone-ground grits is 1 to 4.
