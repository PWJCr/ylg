## Concrete Blocks - Manufacturing, Classification & Uses
Manufacturing of Concrete Blocks BIS recommends a fineness modulus of the combined aggregate between 3.6 to 4 and coarse aggregates used are of size 6 to 12 mm. Lean mixes up to 1:8 are generally used. Concrete mix for concrete blocks should not be richer than one part of the cement to six parts of the volume of combined aggregate.

## How to Build a Concrete Block Wall - The Balance Small Business
Foundation.All concrete block walls must rest on a sturdy foundation of poured concrete. The depth and size of the foundation will vary depending on the size of the concrete block wall and the weight it must support, but a typical freestanding wall requires a foundation that is about twice as wide as the wall itself and which extends about 1 foot down below the frost line.

## Concrete Block Manufacturing Process. How are Blocks Made?
A block press is a hydraulic-powered machine that is used for molding concrete blocks. Various types of block presses are available, differing in size and function. The block press you use affects the concrete mix design and downstream processes. Some block presses require wetter mixes, while others work better with extremely dry mixes.

Find a Suitable Place: Find a wide open space, even better if it is shaded, that will work if rain is not that much in your place.The space should be wide enough to mix concrete and to pour it in mold. Make the mold: Use plywood planks and nails to make a one side open box with an inner cavity of 300mm (length) x 200mm (width) x 150mm (thick). This is the standard size of a concrete brick.

Hollow concrete blocks. Open and Closed cavity-type hollow concrete blocks are classified into three grades: Grade A - They possess a minimum density of 1500 kg/m³ and are used for load-bearing walls. Grade B - They have a density below 1500 kg/m¬³ and used for load-bearing walls. Grade C - These blocks are used for non-load bearing walls.
