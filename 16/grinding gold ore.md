## Factors Influence Ore Grinding Mill Efficiency - JXSC Mining
Take a gold mine as an example, reducing ore particle from -15mm to -10mm improve the grinding efficiency from 1150 tons per day to 1500 tons per day, and decrease the steel consumption and electric power consumption by 1.53kg/t to 1.1kg/t and 41.57kWh to 29.2kWh respectively.

## Sulphide Gold Ore Treatment by Leaching and Flotation Process
Problem with gold recovery from sulphide ore: How may a mill get the maximum recovery of gold from a sulphide ore, at the least capital cost and at the same time obtain the highest net return.This latter point is most important. In many cases a gold mill using an all-cyanide flowsheet with fine grinding of all the ore will report very low gold content in the tailings particularly on an
