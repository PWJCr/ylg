## Why Is Natural Gas Replacing Coal? - Bollinger Energy
Over an eight-year period between 2000 and 2008, coal was much less expensive than natural gas and coal contributed to roughly half of all U.S. power generation. Since 2009, however, the gap between natural gas and coal prices has narrowed and is in the process of flipping. Natural gas isn't just replacing coal; it's doing so at a much

## About the Coal Industry
Coal is by far Canada's most abundant fossil fuel, with 6.6 billion tonnes of recoverable coal reserves. Canada has anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal deposits. More than 90% of Canada's coal deposits are located in western provinces, which provides a strategic advantage because of the close proximity of west coast ports.

Coal plants today provide 215 GW of reliable capacity—down >100 GW from just 10 yrs ago due to shutdowns.When plants were at retirement age and replaced more cheaply by gas plants, this made sense. But most coal was retired early, at great cost—and not sufficiently replaced.¹⁴

## Electricity in the U.S. - Energy Information Administration
Jul 15, 2022Coal was the second-largest energy source for U.S. electricity generation in 2021—about 22%. Nearly all coal-fired power plants use steam turbines. A few coal-fired power plants convert coal to a gas for use in a gas turbine to generate electricity. Petroleum was the source of less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation in 2021.

"Coal has been the cheaper option for power generation for most of 2022 and has also been given a boost by the tight supply situation for gas in Europe," Rystad Energy analyst Fabian Rønningen told Insider. Given current prices, coal is expected to be the more competitive option for the next two-and-a-half years, he added.

## Uses of Coal - Industrial and Domestic Uses of Coal - BYJUS
In the steel industry, coal is used indirectly to make steel. What happens here is that coal is baked in furnaces to form coal coke. Once this is formed, manufacturers use coal coke to smelt iron ore into iron and make steel. Meanwhile, ammonia gas is usually recovered from coke ovens and this is used to manufacture nitric acid, ammonia salts

## There will be a charge forsage.fr
Coal-fired generation puts out about twice as much carbon dioxide—around a tonne for every megawatt hour generated—as electricity generated by burning natural gas at 500 kg of greenhouse gas per megawatt hour. In addition to generating electricity, natural gas is also popular in some countries for heating and as an automotive fuel.. 7700
