Partial replacement of copper slag in fine aggregate and cement reduces the cost of making concrete. Replacement of copper slag (100% replacement with sand)increases the self weight of concrete specimens to the maximum of 15-18%. The initial and final setting time of copper slag admixed concrete is higher than control concrete.

The physical and chemical properties of copper slag were investigated. Copper slag, in amounts of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 percent, was substituted for fine aggregate in cement mortar and concrete. The fineness modulus of the combination of copper slag and fine aggregate was roughly 2.6, the optimum fineness modulus for concrete mix design.

## Effect of Copper Slag as a Partial Replacement of Fine Aggregate on the 
For this research work, M20 grade concrete was used and tests were conducted. Various concrete mixtures were prepared with different proportions of copper slag as fine aggregates replacement. Concrete mixtures were evaluated for workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, corrosion, acid resistivity and microstructural analysis.

## Effect of copper slag as fine aggregate replacement in high strength 
The objective of the present study is to utilize high volume copper slag (i.e. 100%) as a replacement to fine aggregate and partially replacing cement with Nano silica. The work is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the fine aggregate is replaced with copper slag in different percentages of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.

##  Effect of Copper Slag As a Fine Aggregate on The Properties of High 
The performance of concrete mixtures containing copper slag and Nano silica in terms of compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and water absorption were studied. From all these studies it could be determined that high volume copper slag with 100% replacement as fine aggregate in high strength structural
