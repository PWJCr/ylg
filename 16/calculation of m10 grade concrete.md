## Different Grade of Concrete: M20, M25, M30, their Mix ratio and Uses.
Uses of Different Grades of Concrete. 1. Ordinary Grade: M5, M10, and M15 grades of concrete are mostly used in Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) works as bed concrete below column footing. While M20 grade concrete is used for RCC works (for mild exposure) such as the construction of slabs, beams, columns, footings, etc. 2.

Total weight of concrete ingredients = 50+115+209+27.5 = 401.5 say 400 kg. Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum. No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require. 1.Cement = 6 bags

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

It is recommended, depending on the job you are doing, to add anywhere from an extra 4% to 10% to your concrete order to make sure you have enough concrete to finish the job.

## How to Calculate Quantities of Cement, Sand and Aggregate for  - Happho
For calculation, We consider a nominal concrete mix proportion of 1:2:4 (~M20). Step-1: Calculate Volume of Materials required.  209 Kgs of aggregate and 27.5 kgs of water to produce M20 grade concrete. Cement: Sand: Aggregate: Water: 1 bag (50kg) 115 Kgs: 209 Kgs: 27.5 Kgs: Step-3: Calculate Material Requirement for producing 1 Cum Concrete.

## Grades of Concrete with Proportion (Mix Ratio) - Civilology
Concrete grades are denoted by M10, M20, M30 according to their compressive strength. The "M" denotes Mix design of concrete followed by the compressive strength number in N/mm2. "Mix" is the respective ingredient proportions which are Cement: Sand: Aggregate Or Cement: Fine Aggregate: Coarse Aggregate. we already discussed the mix
