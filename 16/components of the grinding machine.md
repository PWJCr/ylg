## Principles of Grinding eLearning | Industrial Machining  - Amatrol
A grinding machine uses an abrasive product — usually a rotating wheel — to shape and finish a workpiece by removing metal and generating a surface within a given tolerance. A grinding wheel is made with abrasive grains bonded together. Each grain acts as a cutting tool, removing tiny chips from the workpiece.

## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high

## Grinding Machine - Types and Uses of a Grinding Machine
A cylindrical grinding machine may have multiple grinding wheels. Here the work piece is rotated and fed through the wheels to form a cylinder. It is widely utilized to manufacture accurate objects like tubes, rods, bushings, bearings, and other parts. An efficient surface grinder may be manually operated or CNC controlled.
