## Pakri Barwadih Coal Mine | SabrangIndia
With the beginning of opencast mining under the Pakri Barwadih Coal Mine Project that was started by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) for dry fuel, 26 villages are reportedly going to lose existence. Roughly, 16,000 people - all of whom are farmers - will be displaced from the acquired the villages.

## Sustainability | Free Full-Text | Assessing Ground Vibration Caused by 
Ground vibration induced by rock blasting is an unavoidable effect that may generate severe damages to structures and living communities. Peak particle velocity (PPV) is the key predictor for ground vibration. This study aims to develop a model to predict PPV in opencast mines. Two machine-learning techniques, including multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and classification and
