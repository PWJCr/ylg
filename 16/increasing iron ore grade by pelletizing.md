Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Beneficiation Plants and Pelletizing Plants for Utilizing Low Grade 
Presently, the most effective and often followed route taken to utilize such deposits is the provision of beneficiation plants for upgrading iron ore and pelletizing plants for agglomerating. Kobe Steel has much experience in constructing both beneficiation and pelletizing plants and has its own pelletizing process (KOBELCO pelletizing system).

Iron Ore Pelletizing.  Depending on the nature of the iron ore, which may be magnetic or low-grade, various grinding processes are considered. Binders such as clay, lime or bentonite are also added to increase the wet strength of the kale and improve its handling. The pre-wetted material is then formed into green balls in balling equipment.
