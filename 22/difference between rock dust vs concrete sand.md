## Manufactured Sand vs. Natural Sand - Chaney Enterprises
The choice of fine aggregate, whether it is manufactured or natural sand, can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability, pumpability, and finishability. Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical.

## Sakrete vs. Quikrete: Which Is The Better Concrete Mix?
In most cases, the Quikrete concrete mixture is made of sand, gravel, and Portland cement. If you are looking for something less strong but more flexible, Quikrete also offers mortar mixtures, which are softer than concrete. Their concrete mixtures have a wide variety of set time, which can go from as short as 30 minutes to as long as 24 hours.

## What are the pros and cons of different rock dusts?
Glacial rock dust: This is said to have more pollutants than volcanic rock dust (such as basalt), but a lot of people seem to like it. Basalt rock dust: Some sources say basalt rock dust is the optimal kind of rockdust, and I've never heard anyone deny that directly. It has less silica than Azomite and diatomaceous earth, for sure.
