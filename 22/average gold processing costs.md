## What is the Cost of Mining Gold? - Visual Capitalist
The price of gold is up by around 50% since 2016, and it's hovering near the all-time high of $2,000/oz. That's good news for gold miners, who achieved record-high profit margins in 2020. For every ounce of gold produced in 2020, gold miners pocketed $828 on average, significantly higher than the previous high of $666/oz set in 2011.

## Which gold processing methods are the most cost-effective  - Quora
Answer: CIL is carbon-in-leach and CIP is carbon-in-pulp. The difference is that activated carbon is in every tank where gold is leached from an ore slurry with cyanide while CIP has separate tanks for just leaching and then for absorption to activated carbon. The costs of the two options will v

## Process costing | Process cost accounting — AccountingTools
The cost accounting methodology used for this scenario is process costing. Process costing is the only reasonable approach to determining product costs in many industries. It uses most of the same journal entries found in a job costing environment, so there is no need to restructure the chart of accounts to any significant degree.

## The true cost of producing an ounce of gold | Provident
These numbers report that the cost of extracting an ounce of gold is actually over $1,000 per ounce, well above the aforementioned numbers. And since gold is currently trading at just over $1,200 per ounce, it explains why mining companies have had less-than-stellar profits. Determining the costs of mining largely depend on the region as well.
