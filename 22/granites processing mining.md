## How is Granite Mined in 2022? | Marble
Granite is an igneous rock that is made up of primarily quartz and feldspar. It is formed by the cooling and solidification of magma (molten rock that is underground). This rock contains the natural stone that makes up countertops and other surfaces. Powerful machinery and explosives are used to mine granite out of the earth.

The polishing machines have diamond polishing pads that bring out the shine in the stone through each new layer of polishing. This leaves the granite with a smooth, yet natural finish. Once the slabs are polished, they're put into shipping containers (usually 45 slabs of 3cm, or 70 slabs of 2cm.) They will then be transported to the U.S.
