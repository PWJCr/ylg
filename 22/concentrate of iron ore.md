Concentrate is mainly produced by magnetic separation of fine low-grade ore. Iron recovery in concentrates is on average about 80 %, iron content in them being 60-65 %. Sinter ore (iron-ore fines) is produced by crushing, screening and deslurrying high-grade ore rich in iron, fineness being less than 10 mm.

In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use. The ore can be concentrated or separated by both physical and chemical means. The ore obtained after the completion of the ore concentration is called concentrate.

## Ukraine: Carriage of Iron Concentrate and Iron Ore Fines Cargoes
Large quantities of iron concentrate and smaller quantities of iron ore fines are shipped in bulk from the port of Yuzhny, as well as from the Ukrainian ports of Odessa, Ilyichevsk and Nikolayev. These are Group A cargoes under the IMSBC Code and are therefore liable to liquefy if the moisture content exceeds the transportable moisture limit (TML).
