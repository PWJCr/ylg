## How gold is made - history, used, parts, procedure, industry, machine 
Gold, recognizable by its yellowish cast, is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period, humans have collected gold from stream beds, and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C., when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry, religious artifacts, and utensils such as goblets.

## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
The process produces gold of up 99.5% purity. A repeat of the process may further improve the purity of gold produced by this method. Gold smelting is an important process in the production of gold. It enables gold miners to separate impurity materials from pure gold that is desirable in the market. Smelting often produces gold to the purity

## Gold Plating - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The plating process starts with a gold strike treatment to prevent the exchange reaction. The same strike bath can be used for the first rinse after the gold plating. The current density depends a lot on the processing method; that is, 0.2-0.4 Adm −2 is used for barrel plating and 0.5-1 Adm −2 for rack plating.

Let it sit for about 15 minutes, then stir gently with a glass rod. The gold should start to dissolve and form a yellow solution at the bottom of the container. When all of the gold has dissolved, pour off the solution into another container. Rinse the circuit board thoroughly with water to remove any traces of acid [2].

Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e. gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as color) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calverite (AuTe), aurostibnite (AuSb

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
