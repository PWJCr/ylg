Recycle. Recycling is crucial in the effort to prevent valuable materials from ending up in the landfill, with the potential to turn 100 percent of non-hazardous waste back into new construction products. The key to successful recycling is to segregate waste as you go, using different skips or containers for different materials.

Types of Construction Wastes and Recycling Strategies. 1. Brick. Brick wastes are generated as a result of demolition, and may be contaminated with mortar and plaster. Brick wastes are sometimes blended with other materials like timber and concrete. Currently, bricks are recycled by crushing and using as filling materials.
