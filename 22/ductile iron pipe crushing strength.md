Cast iron pipes should work the same way in theory. This great inherent strength is what caused early city planners to choose cast iron as the chosen material for house sewer pipes . After all, a strong metal is far less likely to crack, sag, burst, or spill sewage.  Specialty cast iron sewer pipe fittings ensure a proper installation.

What is ductile iron pipe? Ductile iron pipe was introduced to the market in the 1950s as a high-strength replacement for cast iron pipe. Cast iron pipe is brittle and prone to breaking under high pressure or impacts. As the name suggests, ductile iron pipe is flexible and will bend instead of breaking. Both forms of iron contain graphite.

The effect of preheating is to reduce the cooling rate after Welding-ductile-iron. This will effectively avoid or reduce the formation of martensite, the hard phase prone to cracking under stress. The interpass temperature should be preferably 320 °C (600 °F) but in any case not more than 370 °C (700 °F).

At standard outdoor temperatures, class 150 ductile iron keeps a seal up to 250 psi. Class 300 can stand up to pressures as high as 640 psi. Ductile iron has excellent corrosion resistance, tensile strength, and yield strength. Unlike cast iron, ductile iron does not break when it is bent, so it is more suited for high demand applications.
