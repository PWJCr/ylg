## Best practices in the CNC machining of composites
Speeds must be maintained at surface feet per minute (sfm), as this works for most material types. If you are machining solid composites, bring the spindle speed down to one-third of those values; you can also go through the cutting tool provider to learn about proper parameters. 6. Pick the right tool holder.

## Workholding Styles & Considerations - In The Loupe
Fixtures are typically used in milling operations while jigs are generally used in drilling, reaming, tapping and boring. Jigs and fixtures are more precise relative to standard cnc workholding devices, which leads to tighter tolerances. They can also be indexable, allowing them to control the cutting tool movement as well as workpiece movement.
