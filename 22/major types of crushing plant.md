In most aggregate crushing plants, primary crushing is carried out in a jaw crusher, although a gyratory primary crusher may be used. If material is easily crushed and not excessively abrasive, an impact breaker could also be the best choice as a primary crusher.  There are two main types of jaw crushers - single toggle and double toggle.
