Since 2007, the mine has undergone several successful expansions, more than doubling mill throughput levels from 1,563 tonnes per day to its current design throughput of 3,600 tonnes per day. The mill employs conventional crushing, grinding and flotation to produce copper and gravity concentrates with significant gold and silver credits.

## Producing Copper Nature's Way: Bioleaching
Bioleaching is the extraction of a metal from sulfide ores or concentrates using materials found native to the environment; namely, water, air and microorganisms. In other words, bioleaching is the commercialization of the ability of certain bacteria and archaea, found in nature, to catalyze the oxidation of sulfide minerals.

## Utilization of waste coal flotation concentrate for copper matte 
Aug 1, 2021The converting slag was only used for the matte smelting process. The calorific value of flotation concentrate is approximately as high as that of the coke used in the smelting process of copper matte under analysis. The grain size of the copper concentrate was from 0.03 to 0.15 mm. Table 2.

To perform the study, high copper-content molybdenite flotation concentrate was used, which was obtained by enrichment of copper-molybdenum ore from one of the deposits in Kazakhstan. The concentrate composition was analyzed using the ICP method and the following results were obtained, wt.%: Mo — 52.5, Cu — 3.0, S — 35.0, Fe — 3.4, and SiO 2 — 2.5.

## First Quantum Minerals Ltd. - Our Operations
The flotation tails are treated in the magnetite plant to produce a high-quality, low-cost iron concentrate. The plant currently produces approximately 13,800 tonnes of copper in concentrate per year at a grade of 21% copper, with credits received for contained gold; and in addition, 450,000 tonnes of high-grade magnetite concentrate per year.
