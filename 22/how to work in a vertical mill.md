On a vertical mill, the rotary cutting head has a vertical alignment, causing the spindle to move up and down along the Z-axis while the machine is in operation. As the spindle moves, the cutters work to remove material as the rest of the machine moves and shifts along the X-axis and Y-axis to continuously position the object for further cutting.
