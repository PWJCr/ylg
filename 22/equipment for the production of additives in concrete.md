## Concrete
Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and any additives—to produce concrete. Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type

## Eco-Friendly Alternatives To Traditional Concrete
Posted on July 18, 2019. Concrete is a mixture of cement, gravel, sand, water and a range of aggregates. With about 10 billion tons of concrete produced every year, it is the most consumed substance in the world, second only to water.. It is also the world's most widely used material for construction - from bridges to large buildings, concrete forms the very foundation of our infrastructure.

## Concrete Admixtures (Additives)- Types, Selection, Properties, Uses
🕑 Reading time: 1 minuteConcrete admixtures (additives) enhances the properties of concrete for applications in construction with special requirements. Concrete additives are used to achieve desired workability in case of low water cement ratio, and to enhance setting time of concrete for long distance transportation of concrete. So, it is of much importance for a [.]

## The ABCs of concrete production - Elematic precast technology
The mix design should be fully tested in pre-production. The concrete mix and its curing method strongly affect the speed of the production cycle. The hardening time can vary between 5-20 hours. Cement quality is critical to the production cycle. The best results are achieved with cements that are designed especially for the precast industry.
