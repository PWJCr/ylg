## Underground Coal Gasification | netl.doe.gov
Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) takes advantage of the same chemical reactions of coal to produce product gases, as those occurring in conventional gasifier reactors. The main difference is that in UCG the underground coal seam itself becomes the reactor, so that the gasification of the coal takes place underground instead of in a manufactured gasification vessel at the surface.1 Obviously

## Underground coal gasification - Global Energy Monitor
Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a gasification process used to produce gas from coal in situ by injecting air or oxygen into non-mined coal seams and extracting the product gas via surface wells. The resulting synthetic gas ("syngas") can be used to produce electricity, as well as chemicals, liquid fuels, hydrogen and synthetic natural gas.

Advantages of surface mining include economic and financial benefits for miners and communities and a safer alternative to pit mining, but its disadvantages include environmental impacts, such as erosion and contamination. Surface mining, also called strip mining, delivers economically vital supplies of coal, which powers transportation and creates consumer products, boosting local economies.
