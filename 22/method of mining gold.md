Nov 1, 2021Miners use heavy mining machinery to drill wide steps known as benches, which separate the rock containing gold (ore) from the rock with no economic quantities of gold (waste). Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles.

The caving mining method is mainly used to manage the ground pressure around mining by caving the surrounding rock, and then filling it into the goaf to manage the ground pressure. When using this method for deep mining of gold mines, there are mainly the following methods. First, there is the sub-column caving method.

Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

Hydraulic mining was a potentially efficient method of getting gold out of the ground, but it was also the most environmentally destructive. The principle was very simple but devastating — water under pressure would be directed against a bank of gravel deposits and the hillside would wash away rapidly.
