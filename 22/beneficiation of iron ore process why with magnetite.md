## Why we need Magnetite's high-grade iron ore - NXTmine
Dec 12, 2021There are two main types of minerals in iron ore deposits sold in the commercial seaborne iron ore market. The first is hematite, which has high in-situ grades of high 50s to mid 60s in iron content, and is the cheapest to develop and operate at large scale, making it the mainstay of the current iron ore market. The second is magnetite.

## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

## beneficiation of iron ore process why with magnetite
1) Process for beneficiation of strong magnetic iron ore: Mainly used to separate low-grade magnetite. For strong magnetic ore, because the ore has strong magnetism and is easy to grind and beneficiate, it is mostly used for coarse-grained magnetite. Single-stage grinding, otherwise a multi-stage grinding process is adopted;Apr 03, 2014 DSO, gravity separation, Iron ore, iron ore beneficiation

## process of beneficiation of magnitite iron ore
The improved process of the present invention is applicable to the beneficiation of magnetite concentrates generally, and provides a particularly advantageous mode of winning an iron ore product low in silica from magnetic "taconites" and similar silicious iron-bearing materials.

## Why we use hematite over magnetite as iron ore? - Quora
Answer (1 of 6): Because hematite can be easily reduced to iron by converting it into magnetite then wustite and later iron. The hematite can be easily oxidized and it contain abudant amount of iron. magnetite can't reduced easily
