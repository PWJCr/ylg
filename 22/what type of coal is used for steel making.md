## The Types of Coal: Composition, Usage, and Energy Value - ThoughtCo
Sep 1, 2021Coals of varying composition are used as a combustible fossil fuel for generating electricity and producing steel around the world. Coal is among the fastest-growing energy sources in the 21st century, along with natural gas and renewable energy, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and BP's 2021 Statistical Review of World Energy.

## What is coking coal used for in steel production?
Score: 4.9/5 ( 38 votes) Coking coal is an essential input for production of iron and steel. The largest single use of coal in the steel industry is as a fuel for the blast furnace and for the production of metallurgical coke for reduction of iron ore or for injection with the hot blast.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.

## Difference Between Coking Coal and Thermal Coal
What is Coking Coal? Coking coal is a type of coal that is important in making high-quality coke. It is also called metallurgical coal. This substance is an essential fuel and is useful as a reactant in the blast furnace process of primary steelmaking. Therefore, the demand for this type of coal is parallel to that of steel.

Global steel production is dependent on coal. 70% of the steel produced today uses coal. Metallurgical coal - or coking coal - is a vital ingredient in the steel making process. World crude steel production was 1.4 billion tonnes in 2010. Around 721 million tonnes of coking coal was used in the production of steel.

## Raw materials - Coking plant | ArcelorMittal
To make steel in a blast furnace, coal must first be turned into coke. Coke has a dual role in the steelmaking process. First, it provides the heat needed to melt the ore, and second, when it is burnt, it has the effect of 'stealing' the oxygen from the iron ore, leaving only the pure iron behind. In the coking plant, coal is heated in the absence of oxygen to 1250c.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon
