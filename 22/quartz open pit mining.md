## Fimiston Open Pit "Super Pit" Gold Mine - Mining Technology
Mining at Super Pit is done using conventional open pit methods including drilling and blasting. Every year, around 15Mt of rock including waste rock is removed. Loading machines include PC 8000 hydraulic shovels that can carry 60t of material in their buckets in a single pass. Ore is loaded in Caterpillar 793 haul trucks of 225t capacity.

## Open-Pit Mining | Method and Process | Epiroc US
Jan 7, 2021Open-pit mining technology. Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.

Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

## What would make people choose open-pit quarrying instead of tunnel mining?
There are plenty of tunnel mines in the medieval era and older. Seam mining often involved tunnels just because removing the huge amounts of rock to follow a seam was impractical. the bulkier and closer to the surface the material you are mining the better pit mining works. Conversely the less bulky and the deeper it is the better tunnels work.
