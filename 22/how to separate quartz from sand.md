A magnet from an old hard drive(in a plastic bag)removed all the ironsand effectively but the remaining opaque sand and tiny garnets are hard to remove.Using a high-powered magnifying glass it is possible to sort out 1 grain at a time!

Pre-lab Questions 1. Water will be useful in separating the salt and sand because salt is soluble in water, which allows it to dissolve into a homogenous mixture, allowing for filtering of the sand. 2. Properties of sand and salt that will help separate them are that salt is water soluble, and the sand is insoluble in water. 3.

## Ten uses and purification processes of quartz sand
The content of sio2 in quartz sand decreases with the increase of particle size, while the grade of impurity minerals such as iron and aluminum is opposite, especially for quartz sand containing a large amount of clay minerals. Therefore, it is very necessary to separate quartz ore with water before beneficiation, and the effect is obvious.
