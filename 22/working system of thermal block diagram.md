## IOT Thermal & Mask Scan Entry System Flap Barrier | Covid Prevention
If a person is flagged by system for high temperature or no Mask the system glows the red light and bars the person from entry. Also the face and temperature of person is transmitted over IOT to server for authorities to take action and test the person for covid. Thus the system provides a 100% automated system to prevent the spread of COVID.

## Thermal Control System - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The function of a thermal control system is to maintain the temperature of the EHC in order to provide the wearers with an ideal thermal microclimate. Because the wearers may be exposed to various environmental conditions and their activity levels may vary greatly, their skin temperatures and the clothing microclimate temperatures may also vary.

## Facial recognition system
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.. Development began on similar systems in the 1960s, beginning as a form of computer application.
