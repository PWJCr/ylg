Working of Wind Power Plant. Blades of the wind turbine work as an airfoil of different cross-sections all along the length. When fluid (air) moves over this airfoil it generates a lift force thus making the blade to rotate at its axis. The generator is also connected to the rotor shaft starts rotating and produces electricity.
