How Concrete Is Recycled . Concrete is recycled by using industrial crushing equipment with jaws and large impactors. After the concrete is broken up, it is usually run through a secondary impactor and is then screened to remove dirt and particles and to separate the large and small aggregate.

Concrete recycling is the smart, cost-efficient and environmentally friendly way to reuse aggregate left behind when concrete structures are demolished. Demolished concrete can be delivered to us by the truckload. We then crush it, remove the steel, then run it through our plant to produce a range of recycled concrete products.

Since the 1940s, recycling concrete pavements (crushed concrete) has been a fairly common solution. The first instance in the US was following World War II. US Route 66 in Illinois needed to be expanded from two to four lanes. During this reconstruction project, the old concrete was recycled and reused in the new project.

Cost to Dig a Basement Under an Existing House. The average cost of underpinning and benching for a basement is calculated by linear foot. Thus, if you have a basement that is 40×20, then you have a total of 120 linear feet. Underpinning costs, on average, around $350 per linear foot.Benching costs less, around $250 per linear foot. The wide variability creates a potential for backfill failure.
