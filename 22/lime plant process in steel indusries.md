Quicklime--both high calcium and dolomitic--enjoys its most extensive use as a flux in purifying steel in the electric arc furnace (EAF) and basic oxygen furnace (BOF).Lime is particularly effective in removing phosphorus, sulfur, and silica, and to a lesser extent, manganese. Lime also has important uses in secondary refining of steel and in the manufacture of steel products.

## Manufacturing Process of Steel - Properties Fabrication Uses
Some of the processes involved in the production of steel take in energy while others release energy. In the Blast Furnace, for example, the thermal decomposition of limestone takes in energy. Reactions which take in energy are endothermic. Other processes in the steel plant offset these energy losses.
