The steam engine could keep the ovens constantly heated to better produce the iron. .To bring in large numbers of workers to bring in large bulky raw materials such as iron ore and coal and to ship the finished goods to consumers.

## Distribution of Major Industries: Location Factors - Clear IAS
The Indian iron and steel industry consists of large integrated steel plants as well as mini steel mills. It also includes secondary producers, rolling mills and ancillary industries. Changes in locations: Before 1800 A.D. iron and steel industry was located where raw materials, power supply and running water were easily available. Later the ideal location for the industry was near coal fields and close to canals and railways.

## Location factors: Iron-ore, coalfield & Industrial Inertia - Mrunal
For example, Pittsburg is not a coastal city and nearby coal-iron ore reserves are getting depleted=> it was becoming more expensive to produce steel using imported iron-ore. But then Pittsburg industrialists lobbied, and US government made steel-pricing policies like "Multiple Basing system", "Pittsburg plus" etc. (in the early 1900s).

Since 1973, steel production in China has increased by 220%, making it the largest producer in the world. India, another developing country, has increased its production levels to meet the growing internal demand and is driven by the fact that India has the largest iron ore deposits in the world.
