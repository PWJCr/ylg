Limestone, a naturally occurring sedimentary rock is composed of high levels of calcium, or magnesium carbonate, or dolomite,5 and other minerals. After removal from quarries and mines, the stone is crushed, which may be followed by secondary or tertiary crushing and screening into particles ranging in size from several inches to dust.

## Quarry Mining, Open-Pit Mining, Strip Mining, Mining Techniques 
Quarries are made when big deposits of commercially helpful minerals or rock are found close to the Earth's surface. Quarrying is a type of mining and is also called as open pit mining or strip mining. When minerals are found profound beneath the surface, a deep mine has to be dug to dig out them.

Quarry | mining | Britannica. Sand, gravel, and crushed rock quarries employ standard surface-mining techniques. Crushed stone is used for concrete aggregate, for road building, and, in the case of limestone, as flux in blast furnaces and for chemical applications. The quarrying technique consists of drilling and blasting to fragment the rock.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
