For a ball mill to work, critical speed must be achieved. Critical speed refers to the speed at which the enclosed balls begin to rotate along the inner walls of the ball mill. If a ball mill fails to reach critical speed, the balls will remain stationary at the bottom where they have little or no impact on the material. Ball Mills vs

The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the "Critical Speed", and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed. Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed

The working principle of Ball Mill The working principle of the wet ball mill is similar to that of the dry ball mill, but there are diﬀerences. The wet ball mill needs to add an appropriate amount of water or absolute ethanol during the grinding process, which means that there are certain requirements for the concentration of grinding.

Ball mills work well on hard, brittle materials. They are not as suitable for grinding elastic, ductile or fibrous materials, or for fine grinding in general. Ball mills can blend and grind at the same time, yielding a fine, intimate mixture. Conventional ball mills are usually limited to a particle size of 1µ after one hour of grinding

1) The volume of grinding bowl is 20 ml. The material you can grind should be never less than 1 ml, and no more than 9 ml. 2) Choose size of the grinding balls. Our balls are made in Zirconium Oxide. Note: It is not allowed to mix balls of different diameters, which will increase wear to the balls and bowl. 3) Put the correct number of balls.

5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium
