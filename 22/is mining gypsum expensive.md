Gypsum Dreams. Gypsum is a pale, soft mineral composed of hydrous calcium sulfate. Both gypsum and rock salt, or halite, are geologically peculiar. Pressed under the weight of overlying rock strata, they become plastic and mobile. Gypsum and halite are light compared to other rock layers and so are squeezed upward to form massive salt domes.

## Does gypsum acidify soil-staporkow.pl
Garden Gypsum is a natural mineral and soil conditioner that breaks down clay soil promoting root growth. Nutrients and moisture can be easily absorbed by plant roots with soil that is light and airy rather than a. In order to adjust soil pH, liming products must contain carbonate (CO3-) which reacts with hydrogen ions to neutralize soil acidity.

## How (and Why) is the Gypsum Industry Becoming More Sustainable?
Gypsum deposits are abundant and widespread, allowing for the use of locally mined gypsum in most regions and avoiding transport costs. Many modern plants are built next to coal-fired power stations which make gypsum as a by-product, and depending on the quality of the raw mineral, gypsum mining operations can be rehabilitated easily.
