## What is vanadium and why are we mining it in Queensland?
Mining and processing vanadium in Queensland is one part of meeting these goals. There is currently one vanadium mining lease granted in an area known as the North West Minerals Province of Queensland. The Saint Elmo Vanadium Project, located near Julia Creek, is planned to begin construction in 2022 and producing in 2023.

Vanadium is often agglomerated with titanium, which must be separated out as an impurity during processing. The higher the titanium content in the ore, the harder it is to remove the vanadium.

The silver coloured element vanadium (symbol V) has an atomic weight of 50.9415, specific gravity of 5.96, and melting point of 1929 °C (Bauer et al., 2002). Vanadium, niobium and tantalum belong to group five of the periodic table. The transition metal features a high melting point and good corrosion resistance at low temperature.

Mar 15, 2022In 1966, Union Carbide began mining operations and stockpiling vanadium ore in Garland County. Construction of the vanadium processing mill was completed in 1967, and vanadium oxide was produced for the first time in Arkansas in 1968. By 1970, Arkansas was a major vanadium-producing state in the nation.
