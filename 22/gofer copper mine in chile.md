As far as the table size for an HO slot car track, the absolute minimum amount of space for a two lane or a four lane track would be a 3' x 7'8" door size table. A 4' x 8' size table would be a more ideal minimum table size. If you have more space then consider extending the length from 7'8"-8' to 9-12 feet.

This mine is far from futuristic, though. In fact, it's more than one hundred years old. In 1911, copper deposits were discovered north of Calama and quickly exploited by the US Anaconda Copper Mining Company. It grew into the largest open-pit copper mine in the world, producing more than 600,000 tons of copper annually.
