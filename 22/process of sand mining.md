Sand sales for construction and fracking purposes will grow by much larger percentages.  Frac Sand in the U.S. Fracking sands are primarily mined in an open pit process. The mining cycle starts with the removal of top soilsâcalled overburdenâand ends with backfilling the left-over materials. The smoothed over surface is not the same

## Impacts of Sand Mining
The effect of mining is compounded by the effect of sea level rise. Any volume of sand exported from streambeds and coastal areas is a loss to the system. Excessive instream sand mining is a threat to bridges, river banks and nearby structures. Sand mining also affects the adjoining groundwater system and the uses that local people make of the

Open pit sand mining, (c) Rita E, Pixabay.  It is cheap to extract and simple to process but expensive to transport. This has two consequences. First, sand mines are normally close to where the sand is needed. Rather than there being one global market for sand, the trade in it is made up of many smaller national and sub-national markets
