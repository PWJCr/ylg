Bornite is easily recognized because it tarnishes to iridescent shades of blue, purple, red, green and yellow. It is commonly called "peacock ore" or "purple copper ore" after these iridescent colors. Upon surface exposure, bornite will weather to chalcocite or other copper minerals. Bornite is a popular and fast-selling mineral specimen at

## How is copper extracted? Explained by FAQ Blog
Most of the world's copper comes from the minerals chalcopyrite and chalcocite. Chrysocolla and malachite also are mined for copper. What rock is copper found in? Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Where is copper most commonly found? The largest copper mine is found in Utah (Bingham Canyon). Other major

## Is this Bornite or Chalcopyrite? Or are both minerals the same thing 
This. 3. level 1. · 8 mo. ago. They are not the same things. Chalcopyrite is CuFeS2 and is yellow (more yellow than pyrite FeS2 which people normally call fool's gold). Bornite is nominally Cu5FeS4 and normally has a bluish-purple (but sometimes reddish) color. However, the copper-iron sulfide system has a lot of minerals so the bornite tends

## chalcocite compared to chalcopyrite ore processing
ChalcopyriteChalcopyrite is a copper iron sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the tetragonal system. It has the  Associated copper minerals include the sulfides bornite (Cu5FeS4), chalcocite (Cu2S), covellite (CuS), digenite (Cu9S5);  Chalcopyrite is present with many ore-bearing environments via a variety of ore forming
