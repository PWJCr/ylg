dry concrete = 1.54 x wet concrete. and we have to find for 1m3 [in wet concrete] so therefore it is dry concrete = 1.54 x 1= 1.54m3. Now, lets to get the quantity of sand :- The total mix is 1+1+2 = 4. and from which sand has the proportion of 1 .

## How to calculate sand quantity in 1m3 of concrete - Civil Sir
The quantities of sand for 1m3 of concrete production can be calculated as follows:- weight of sand for 1:2:3 mix = 1.54m3 × 2/6 × 1600 kg/m3 = 820 kg, which is approximately equal as 18 cft, or 0.5 cubic meter or 1 loose ton bag of sand quantities. Thus you need 820kg or 18 cft of sand quantity to prepare 1 cubic metre of 3000 psi concrete.

To make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete. The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is 1:1.5:3 that mean 1 part of cement, 1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing.

Sand quantity for 1m3 of M20 concrete:part of sand = 1.5/5.5, density of sand = 1680kg/m3, dry volume = 1.54m3, weight = volume × density, weight of sand = 1.5/5.5×1.54m3 ×1680 kg/m3 = 706kg, so 706kg sand is required for 1m3 of M20 grade of concrete.

## How much aggregate is 1m3 of concrete? - Tank Functions
How much cement sand and gravel do I need for 1m3 concrete? Sand quantity for 1m3 of M20 concrete: part of sand = 1.5/5.5, density of sand = 1680kg/m3, dry volume = 1.54m3, weight = volume × density, weight of sand = 1.5/5.5×1.54m3 ×1680 kg/m3 = 706kg, so 706kg sand is required for 1m3 of M20 grade of concrete.

## 1 cft concrete weight in kgsail
1 cft 10mm & 20mm aggregate weight in kg Civil Sir. Apr 11, 2020 1 ton 5/8 stone chips = cft (cubic feet): we know that density of stone chips = 1680 kg/m3,it means 1m3 stone chips weight is 1680kg, 1 ton = 1000kg,1 ton stone chips to cubic meter = 1000/1680 = 0.5952m3 and 1m3 = 35.32 cft, so 1 ton 5/8 stone chips = 0.5953 × 35.32 = 21cft, so.

## How Much Coarse Aggregate Do I Need For 1m3 Concrete?
There is a lot of coarse aggregate that is needed for 1m3 concrete. The most important part of this is the size of the aggregate. A small amount of coarse aggregate will do the job well, but a larger amount will result in a better concrete mix.  How Much Cement, Sand And Coarse Aggregate Are Required For 1 Cubic Meter Of Concrete? When a

A ton of sand is typically about 0.750 cubic yards (3/4 cu yd), or 20 cubic feet. Sand is assumed relatively damp, since adding water can increase or decrease the density of the sand considerably (e.g. if it was raining or if you dig up and leave sand under the sun so water evaporates)..
