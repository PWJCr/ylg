## properties of quarry dust compared to fine aggregates
Balamurugan et.al.(2013)(8) ascertained that quarry dust can be utilized in concrete mixtures as a good substitute for river sand with higher strength at 50% replacement. Adams et.al.(2013)(9) found that the replacement of 50% fine aggregate by M-Sand induced higher compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and durability.

## What is the Percentage of Stone Dust that can be added along with Fine 
The stone dust decreases the workability of concrete due to the larger portions of fine particles. 11 At 75% of sand replacement, the percentage of increase in compressive and tensile strength was 40 and 28 compared with the reference mix, respectively. The unit weight increases with an increase in the percentage of replacement of sand.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Development of sustainable concrete using silica fume and stone dust 
Natural fine aggregate replacement with stone dust is a smart substitute to river sand for the development of concrete. Stone dust can be used as a substitute material for fine aggregate in concrete due to its textured surface combined with the well-graded size of its particles. Stone dust addition in concrete will, therefore, improve the

## Mineral hydration
In chemistry, mineral hydration is an inorganic chemical reaction which adds water to the crystal structure of a mineral, usually creating a new mineral, usually called a hydrate.. In geological terms, the process of mineral hydration is known as retrograde alteration and is a process occurring in retrograde metamorphism.It commonly accompanies metasomatism and is often a feature of wall rock

Compressive strength of concrete made using 05 % ceramic waste aggregate and 05 % stone dust as replacement of coarse aggregate and fine aggregate respectively, is about 20% more than that of referral concrete at 28 days. However, compressive strength at 05% recycled aggregate and 05% stone dust is marginally than that of conventional concrete.

This fine aggregate was replaced by 0%, 5% and 10% by weight for the M-30 mix. The cubes were tested for compressive strength for 7 and 28 days and the result obtained was compared with the nominal mix M-30. The result shows that compressive strength and workability decreases as the rice husk percentage increases.

## Replacement Of Fine Aggregate With Stone Dust In India
Jan 01, 2018 The deficit of natural sand arise the need of alternative materials for replacement of natural sand. This experimental study explores in detail the crushed stone dust which is locally available industrial solid waste material in India as alternative material to natural sand that is being conventionally used as fine aggregate in cement concrete.
