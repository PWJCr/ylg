## The kinetics of lime slaking - Murdoch University
Although the slaking of lime is a reaction of great antiquity, there have been few fundamental studies of its kinetics and mechanism. In this paper, the kinetics of the reaction are reported for lime samples in two different arrangements: rotating discs and powders. In the former case, the rate was measured by solution analysis; in the latter, by calorimetry.

## Slaked Lime (Calcium Hydroxide) | Carmeuse
Hydrated lime also called slaked lime is produced when water is added to calcium oxide (CaO, or quicklime). The result of this mixing of water and calcium oxide (quicklime) is an exothermic reaction known as slaking. The slaking reaction produces calcium hydroxide, (Ca (OH) 2 ). Initially, the calcium hydroxide is produced as a fine dry powder.

## Lime and its Production
Lime slaking The Burnt Lime or Quicklime is then combined with water (slaked) as quickly as possible. From the moment it is burnt the material starts to degrade by 'air-slaking'. Combining Quicklime (CaO) and water (H20) produces Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 - slaked lime and heat. There are three main ways of slaking the Quicklime:

## Lime Slaker | Sodimate Inc
Many high-consumption lime industries use Sodimate quicklime slakers as opposed to using powdered hydrated lime or ready-mixed lime slurry. Our slakers are able to absorb the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water, and efficiently separate lime grit from the highly concentrated calcium hydroxide resulting from the slaking operation.

## Lime : Manufacturing, Classification and Storage - Civil Engineering Notes
Care must be taken during the slaking of this lime, as any excess addition of water will cause the lime to harden. Depending on the percentage of clay present, it is further classified into feebly, moderately and eminently hydraulic lime. Poor Lime : This lime is also known as lean lime or impure lime. It contains clay impurities more than 30%.

This is done using a water-tight impermeable platform made from masonry or concrete structure. In this process, quick lime is spread in a 150mm thick layer over the platform & water starts sprinkling over the quick lime in small quantities.

1. Regenerating Citric Acid. To purify citric acid, lime is essentially used. Initially, the citric acid solution is filtered well to abstract its properties, removing suspended solids from it. To this filtered solution, hydrated lime is added for further purification. As a result, calcium citrate precipitates from the solution and is removed.
