The ballast will look better once the surrounding scenery is brought up to meet the ballast. Once all ballasting is completed test the track again as you will have small grains of ballast where they should not be and will have glue on your track. Small bits of ballast can be carefully removed with a scalpel blade, but take care.

## Ballast - Functions and Types - The Constructor
Ballast is a granular material which is placed and packed below and around the railway sleepers. Different types of ballast materials used are broken stone, sand, gravel, moorum, brickbats etc. The main purpose of ballast is to transmit the load from sleepers to the formation (consolidated track bed) and to provide drainage facilities to the track.

Use a pipette to draw up the glue mixture and then hold the tip of the pipette close to the center of the track between the rails. Gently drip the glue mixture onto the ballast and allow the glue to seep into the ballast slowly. Continue to drip the glue in until you see the white glue saturating the ballast but not enough to cause pooling.

Abstract. Railway track formations generally consist essentially of a layer of coarse aggregate, or ballast, in which the sleepers are embedded (see Fig. 12.1). The ballast may rest directly on the subgrade or, depending on the bearing capacity, on a layer of blanketing sand. The layer of ballast is intended to provide a free draining base
