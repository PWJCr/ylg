## CDC - Mining Project - Open Pit Highwall Safety - NIOSH
Oct 1, 2020This pilot project research addresses two issues that are fundamental to open pit highwall mining: rockfall catchment and slope monitoring. Rockfall hazards in open pit mines are a constant threat to mine workers and are typically addressed by catch benches—horizontal spaces set in from the highwall to retain rock spillage—as mandated by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).

## "Novel concepts for monitoring the stability of open pit mine highwalls 
"Ground control problems at surface mining operations can occur for a variety of reasons. The geologic setting, rock strengths, joint spacing, orientation, pore pressures, and many other factors contribute to slope instabilities that range from small rock falls to massive slides of material. While much of this ground movement can be predicted or controlled, each year many completely unexpected

In the U.K., 3-D Laser Mapping has been one of the pioneers in the use of Lidar systems for monitoring open-pit mines. Development of its SiteMonitor system was driven by the need for a mapping and monitoring solution that takes full advantage of the benefits of laser scanning while remaining easy to use, the company pointed out.

Benefits of combined radar and geodetic monitoring in open pit mines - Automatic geodetic monitoring was introduced to mining in the early 1990s with the development of automated total stations. This was followed by GNSS technology, which brought about significant enhancement and new capabilities to geodetic monitoring in mines.

Slope stability accidents are one of the leading causes of fatalities at U.S. surface mining operations. The Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is currently conducting research to reduce the fatalities associated with slope failures and other unexpected failures of ground. The purpose of this paper is to introduce various warning signs

recording of the stability of the rocks making up the slopes surrounding an open pit mine. The main reasons why slope stability monitoring is done are: 1. To verify mine design. In this case slope monitoring measurements can be used as a basis for maintaining, steepening or reducing slope angles with the resultant economic and safety benefits.
