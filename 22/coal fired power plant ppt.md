features of major types of coal used for power generation are listed in Table 1. Pulverised coal (PC) is the fuel used in about 97% of the world's coal-fired capacity (IEA, 2008). In a pulverised coal-fired power plant, coal is milled and burned with air in tall boilers that provide for complete burnout and efficient heat transfer.

## Steam Electric Power Generating Effluent Guidelines - US EPA
New technologies for generating electric power and the widespread implementation of air pollution controls over the last 30 years have altered existing wastewater streams or created new wastewater streams at many power plants, particularly coal-fired plants. The 2015 rule addresses these changes in the industry.

Membrane skids are compact and modular which enables capture systems to be fit into existing plants with little available space. MTR has two design variations for coal fired power plant; one for high CO 2 removal rates (90%) and a second for partial capture rates (~60%). Where a high capture rate is not required, the lowest cost-of-capture is

Coal generates 54% of our electricity, and is the single biggest air polluter in the U.S. A typical (500 megawatt) coal plant burns 1.4 million tons of coal each year. There are about 600 U.S. coal plants. The two fundamental problems with using coal for fuel. ---Burning coal emits Sulfuric and Nitric oxide into the atmosphere creating acid rain.

## What Are the Differences Between Coal-Fired Power Plants and Gas-Fired 
A coal-fired power plant's infrastructure is more complex than that for a natural gas-fired power plant and thus costs more to construct and maintain. Some of the reasons why this is the case include: The coal-burning process requires a lot more energy to create the steam needed to generate electric power;
