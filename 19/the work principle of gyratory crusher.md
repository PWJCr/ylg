## Hammer Crusher Working Principle - AGICO Cement Plant
The hammer crusher is a type of ore crushing equipment. It can be used to crush medium-hard brittle materials with low water content, such as limestone, gypsum, slag, coke, coal, etc. It is widely used in cement manufacturing, chemical, electric power, metallurgy, and other industries. As a type of cement crushers, hammer crushers are often

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one-tenth its size. Usually, metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence, the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place. Here, the maximum reduction ratio is about 8:1.

The basic principle is straightforward: the material to be crushed (the feed), drops into the crushing chamber. The mantle is a moving part that gyrates in an eccentric motion. That is, it doesn't remain completely centred - it swings slightly as it rotates, continually altering the gap between the mantle and the concave (the ring outside

## How do a gyratory crusher work?
How do a gyratory crusher work? A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher, consisting of a concave surface and a conical head with both the surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel liners. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but it does not rotate. The movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement.

Jaw And Gyratory Crusher Construction. Gyratory crusher vs jaw crusher compared with the jaw crusher, its advantages are: the crushing process of the gyratory crusher is to rotate one circle along the annular crushing cavity, and it can work continuously at 360, while the main shaft of the jaw crusher rotates only 135 once, so the production efficiency of the gyratory crusher is.
