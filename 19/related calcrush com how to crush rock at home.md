Put the rock inside a bill or paper and crush then just get a lighter and slide it back and forth until no rocks are felt put in bag and you got powder. Don't use paper. Use magazine paper, it's coated or something so the product won't stick to the paper. Also, I use a razor to slide off smaller pieces to crush.
