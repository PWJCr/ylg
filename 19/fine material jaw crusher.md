## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Jaw crusher: The material is crushed between a fixed jaw and a mobile jaw. The feed is subjected to repeated pressure as it passes downwards and is progressively reduced in size until it is small enough to pass out of the crushing chamber. This crusher produces less fines but the aggregates have a more elongated form.

## fine material jaw crusher
Jaw crushers are typically used as primary crushers because they can take large and variable sized feed material, so the original feed won't have to be blasted down to a fine size. Powerscreen jaws are designed to be significantly more reliable and have lower wear rates, maximizing production and minimizing wear parts.

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
