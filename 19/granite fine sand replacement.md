A gravel support bed is 10-15 lbs. of fine granite. The tolerances in the gravel bed will not allow expired resin to pass through. Instead, the expired resin will be retained inside the water softener tank limiting your impact to gradual lower water pressure. However, tanks without a gravel support bed will allow the expired resin to pass. Replacement Water Softener Resins.

## The role of granite dust in engineered cement composites as a partial 
Nov 24, 2021The results have shown that up to 10% of replacing sand with granite dust, ECC mixes have provided greater properties, in terms of compressive strength, flexural strength, as well as bond strength than the control ECC mix. The addition of granite dust to ECC mixtures, thus, reduces the water absorption by an average of 28.8%.

concrete. The specific gravity of sand is 2.7. d) Granite powder dust Fineness modulus and specific gravity of the granite powder are 2.43 and 2.58 respectively. Sieve analysis was carried out for granite powder and compared with sand; the amount of fine particles present in granite powder is considerably higher when compared to the river sand.

Out of the replacement percentages of 10% to 50%, the highest strength was achieved at 30% in compressive, split and flexural strength. Divakar et al10. (2012) have experimented on the behaviour of M20 grade concrete with the use of granite fines as a partial replacement for sand in 5%, 15%, 25%, 35% and
