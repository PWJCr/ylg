The silica sand breaks down into small particles and gets into the air we breathe. If workers are breathing these small particles into their lungs, their lungs develop silicosis. Silicosis is a lung condition where the small particles get into the workers lungs, the particles get trapped and start to develop fibroptic nodules.

## USA - Process for production of potassium silicate  - Google
A process is disclosed for the hydrothermal production of potassium silicate solutions with high SiO 2 :K 2 O molar ratios, by the hydrothermal reaction of quartz sand with aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions at temperatures in the range of 150° to 300° C. at the pressures of saturated water vapor corresponding to these temperatures in a pressure reactor, which is characterized in that the
