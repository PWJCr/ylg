Self-excited DC motor. The field winding is energized by the residual magnetism and then by the emf induced in the motor. Because of the residual flux, the motor starts to rotate. The self-excited motors are classified into three types, based on the way of connecting the field and armature winding: Shunt motor, Series motor and compound motor.

A DC motor works in the same principle as an AC motor, with a mechanism to allow it to rotate even if the supply is not alternating.Regular motors work because the direction of current reverses (alternates) every half cycle, rendering the armature to rotate.

## Characteristics of DC Motors - Shunt, Series and Compound Motors
Thus, the series DC motor is used where high starting torque is required. Important - At no-load, the armature current is very small and so is the flux. Hence, the speed increases to a dangerously high value which can damage the machine. Therefore, a series motor should never be started on no-load. Characteristics of Cumulative Compound DC Motor

Before knowing about the differences between DC Series and Shunt Motors, let us start to know what a DC motor is. An electric motor that is powered up by direct current is termed as DC motor.In a detailed view, when a current-carrying conductor is positioned in the area of a certain magnetic field, it gains some torque and tends to have a moment. So, this is the same principle where a DC motor

## DC motor
The DC motor was the mainstay of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. The introduction of DC motors and an electrical grid system to run machinery starting in the 1870s started a new second Industrial Revolution.

## Characteristics of DC Series Motor
The characteristic curves of a DC series motor are those curves which show relationships between the following quantities. Torque and armature current (Ta/Ia characteristic). It is known as an electrical characteristic. Speed and torque (N/Ta characteristic) It is also known as mechanical characteristic.

## Ac Series Motor- Working Principle, Construction, Application
Working Principle of AC Series motor. The working principle is the same as the dc series motor. When the ac series motor connected to the AC supply the alternating current start flowing through the field and armature winding. The field winding produces an alternating flux Î¦ that reacts with current flowing in armature winding to produce a torque.
