## Calculating the Speed of a Conveyor System - Technical Articles - control
The conveyor belt speed is calculated as the circumference of the drive roller times the rotations per minute (RPM) of the motor. If there is any gear reduction, don't forget to apply the ratio to the RPM before multiplying the circumference. Conveyor belt speed = Drive roller circumference Motor RPM

In this study, we propose, for the first time, an analytical solution for the diffusion-advection equation to calculate the diffusivity constant and erosion-deposition rates. We have fitted this model to age-depth data derived from 15 soil samples from four soil profiles along a catena located under natural grassland in the Santa Clotilde
