Ten per cent fines load and ACV tests are two well accepted tests for assessing the mechanical properties of aggregates. While the load producing ten per cent fines is determined in the former test, the amount of fines produced under 40 ton load is given as ACV in the latter test.

The crushing value test of aggregate provides the resistance of an aggregate sample to crushing under gradually applied compressive load.Generally, the test is conducted on aggregate passing 12.5 mm and retained on a 10 mm sieve.The aggregate sample is filled in a cylindrical mold and a load of 40 tons is applied through a plunger in a compression testing machine.

## mechanical tests on aggregates aggregate crushing value
Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.

Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.

## Mechanical Properties Of Aggregate | Strenght Harndess Toughness
The load application must be gradual persistent to allow the sample to deform gradually. The test gives a percentage value called the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which relatively measures the resistance shown by aggregates when crushed under compression. Standard Followed: BS: : 1990 (British Standards) (Appendix-2 Page-69)
