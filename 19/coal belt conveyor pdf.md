For pipe conveyors it is desirable to separate the Kx term into separate values for trough and return belt because the value for return Kx is much larger than for standard conveyors. To develop the Ai factors for pipe conveyors, we first reduce Ai by 6/7 to delete one of the return idler bearings (assumes returns at twice trough idler spacing).

##  Fire-protection guidelines for: Conveyors transporting coal
In the conveyor structure any coal which falls from the moving belt, or an accumulation of settled coal dust, is a potential hazard. A mechanical fault in the bearing of a roller, or the friction between a seized roller and the belt, will result in a build up of heat which can be sufficient to ignite the belt, when the belt stops.

The main components of a belt conveyor are: 1. The belt that forms the moving and supporting surface on which the conveyed material rides. It is the tractive element. The belt should be selected considering the material to be transported. 2. The idlers, which form the supports for the carrying and return stands of the belt. 3.

Dry Fog Dust Separation ( DFDS) System. They are used to control the fine dust particle Produced during the coal flow. DFDS system uses high pressure of air (about 3-4 bar) and low pressure of water (about 2-3bar),which generates dry fog and being sprayed at the point of dust generation .The spray angle covers 30 to 90 degree.

Conveyors 10. Avoid Misuse of Conveyors The misuse of a conveyor is a common cause of reducing the life of a conveyor system. Placing heavier and larger objects on a lighter duty conveyor system will add stress and wear to not only the chain and wear strips, but also the motors and reducers — which will eventually result in a breakdown.

## New Solutions for Solving Coal Handling Pumping Problems
Two key factors cause problems when handling coal. First, coal sinks in water. Second, water collects in low spots. Combine this with a conveyor system, which operates below ground and has dust, fine particles and chunks falling from the belt. With nowhere to drain, water collects, and whatever is with it must be pumped up and out together.

These belt conveyors can be run at various inclined angles, typically between 0°- 20° (30° with cleated/chevron belting). For conveyors that operate beyond this incline, steep incline conveyors, which can operate at angles all the way up to 90°, are also available. The diagram below shows the relationship between conveyor center-to-center
