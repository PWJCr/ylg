## Size Of Feed In To A Rough Crusher
The size of a jaw crusher is measured by its gape and width, expressed as gape x width. The gape is the size of the feed opening. The opening at the discharge end of the jaws is known as the set. For example, 400 by 600mm, indicates a distance of 400mm from fixed jaw plate to moving jaw plate where the feed enters, and rough ore bin through.
