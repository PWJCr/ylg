## Investigations of the Dephosphorization of Liquid Iron Solution 
The results of laboratory investigations on the dephosphorization of liquid iron solutions containing chromium and nickel are presented. In particular, the study was focused on the selection of the optimal slag composition and the way the slag should be added. The slags based on calcium and fluorite with cryolite additions were considered.

## Investigations of the Dephosphorization of Liquid Iron Solution 
The most up-to-date trends in stainless steel production—aiming at the reduction of production costs—consist of the substitution of steel scrap by hot metal, coming from the reduction of iron-chromium ores. This process requires a more extensive dephosphorization. The dephosphorization process, when applied to chromium steels, requires slag with high dephosphorization properties, as either

## Dephosphorization - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
More than 90% of the phosphorus load enters the iron and the rest is lost either in the slag or in the flue gas or is absorbed in the refractory linings [27]. Therefore, production of low P hot metal is only possible by using low P-bearing coke and ore. Dephosphorization requires oxidizing conditions, and cannot be conducted in the blast furnace. All phosphorus is removed during oxygen steelmaking in most of the steelmaking operation.

The initial comprehensive studies on dephosphorization were conducted during the 1940s. These studies observed that FeO and CaO are necessary slag constituents for the dephosphorization of steel. These studies also showed that the dephosphorization reaction is exothermic and that the slag capacity for dephosphorization decreases with temperature.
