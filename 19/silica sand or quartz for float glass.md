Answer (1 of 4): To a geologist or mineralogist, "silica" only means a SiO2 compound, regardless of its actual crystal structure. If you had pure SiO2 glass, you could describe it as being made of silica, and you can say that chemically, pure quartz is also SiO2. In quartz sands, the SiO2 is arra

## What is the difference between float glass and ordinary glass in float 
Float glass advantages: First, the float glass is in the tin bath, and the glass floats on the surface of the tin liquid. Therefore, this glass is first of all flat, without corrugations. For mirrors, car glass, do not shape, this is a big advantage. Followed by quartz sand for float glass, the raw material is good.

## Can quartz float on water? - Quora
Answer (1 of 2): No, quartz sinks if you try to make it float. It has a higher specific gravity than water, because H2O's density is relatively light and Quartz's (SiO2's) density is greater. There are some new materials made from quartz though. Certain types of hydrophobic coated silica aerogel
