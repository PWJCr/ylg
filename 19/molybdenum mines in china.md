## molybdenum mines in china
Molybdenum mining and processing techniques have been improved continuously since the first mine was started at Climax near Leadville, Colorado in 1916. Today, the principal moly mines, both primary and by-product, are found along the Great Continental Divide of the Americas, in China and in the CIS.
