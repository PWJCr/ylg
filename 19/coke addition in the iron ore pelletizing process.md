## Iron Ore Pellet Production - FEECO International Inc.
About Iron Ore Pelletizing (Balling) Pellets are a high-grade source of iron ore and are produced via a type of agitation agglomeration (wet granulation or tumble-growth agglomeration) known as pelletizing, and referred to in the iron ore sector as "balling.". The balling process is carried out utilizing either a rotary drum or disc

The coke is a source of carbon monoxide which will reduce the iron oxide in the ore to iron and the carbon monoxide oxidizes to carbon dioxide. The limestone acts as a flux to remove other impurities and help the iron physically separate from the rest of the burden. It comes out carrying a lot of.

## Iron Steel And Metallurgical Coke Production - Emission Factors
Direct reduction involves the reduction of iron ore to metallic iron in the solid state at process temperatures less than 1000°C. Metallurgical coke production: Metallurgical coke production is considered to be an energy use of fossil fuel, and as a result emissions should be reported in Category 1A of the Energy Sector.
