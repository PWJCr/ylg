## Impact Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic. An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill). Dynamic impact could be described as material dropping into a rapidly turning rotor where it receives a smashing blow from a hammer or impeller.

## What Is an Impact Crusher and What Can It Do for You?
The material enters the rotors rapidly moving wings and is hurled outward to be broken upon the peripheral anvils or rocks. The final size of material being processed by an impact crusher is partially determined by the rotational speed of its rotor. As the rotor operates at higher velocities, material is reduced to a finer and finer specification.

## Impact Crusher - Fodamon Machinery
The impact crusher is a kind of crushing machine which uses impact energy to crush materials. When the machine works, driven by the motor, the rotor rotates at high speed. When the material enters the action zone of the plate hammer, it impacts and crushes with the plate hammer on the rotor, and then is thrown to the impact device to crush

## USA - Impeller bar installation and repositioning means for 
The impeller bars on an "open" type rotor of an impact crusher are clamped to each disc of the rotor by means of pairs of cooperating wedges. Each pair of wedges consists of a first wedge acting radially outwards of the rotor between the disc and the impeller bars and a second wedge acting axially of the rotor between the disc and the first wedge to drive the first wedge radially outwards.
