## What Is a Cone Crusher and What Can It Do for You?
The advantage of relying on cone crushers for processing material is that they are capable of sizing harder or more abrasive materials than impact crushers when considering the lifespan of wear parts. However, cone crushers are less able to handle steel contaminants and must be protected from them by use of a magnet or other sorting means

## Advantages Of Using Cone Crusher
the cone crusher has the advantages of low energy consumption and high production energy in the crushing production process. therefore, cone crushers can play a big role in large crushing lines, although the material produced by the cone crusher is usually required to be formed using a vertical impact crusher and a molding machine.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
