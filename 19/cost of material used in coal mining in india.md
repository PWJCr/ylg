## Common Types of Mining Equipment Used in the Mining Industry
Mining is one of the most vital components of modern society due to the use of mined minerals in almost every consumer product. Additionally, 50% of the nation's energy comes from coal or nuclear power that uses uranium. To support this need for modern equipment, mines are found in all 50 states, including our home state of Nevada.

The remainder was metallurgical coal used mainly for steel production. Compared with 2018, coal consumption fell 1.8%, or 18 Mt in 2019, almost exclusively due to lower thermal coal use for power generation. Declining coal demand reflects India's slower economic growth and significant hydropower output with heavy monsoon rains in 2019.

With the enactment of the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973, all coal mines in India were nationalized on 1 May 1973. This policy was reversed by the Narendra Modi administration four decades later. In March 2015, the government permitted private companies to mine coal for use in their own cement, steel, power or aluminium plants.
