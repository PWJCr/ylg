## Granite and Radon
Thorium produces a different type of gas called Thoron. Thorium is a shorter-lived element, which is similar to radon but decays about 6,500 times faster than radon. Thoron has a half-life of about 51 seconds, whereas Radon has a half-life of just over 92 hours. Because most of the Thoron never makes it very far from the granite's surface

## Types of Drilling in Mining - CR Mining
As the mining industry advances and more excavating opportunities present themselves, the number of drilling methods increases. Whether it is for exploration, production, land-clearing or geotechnical purposes, there are drilling methods that serve every mining purpose. Auger Drilling. Auger drilling is the simplest form of drilling.

Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as doré - typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## Granite Rock - Mining Hub Africa
Granite Rock. Granite is the most common type of intrusive igneous rock in the Earth's crust. It forms when the molten rock or magma seeps in the gaps in sedimentary rock layers, and crystallizes slowly owing to its high silicate content. The entire process takes millions of years, and is just a small part of the rock cycle.

## How is Granite Mined? Everything You Need to Know.
Mining granite is a very large industrial process. The first step of making a granite slab is to mine the raw granite materials out of the crust of the earth in large, heavy blocks. Granite slabs are attained from specific sites that are known as quarries. Normally, miners choose quarries that are as close to the surface of the earth as possible.
