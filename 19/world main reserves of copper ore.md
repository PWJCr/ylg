Jun 7, 2021The six largest cobalt reserves in the world by country. 1. Democratic Republic of Congo - 3.6 million tonnes. The DRC is home to more than 50% of the world's cobalt reserves, with an estimated 3.6 million tonnes available for extraction in the country. Major mining operations can be found in the Katanga Province, notably the Mutanda

## How much copper has been found in the world? - USGS
To date, roughly 700 million metric tons of copper have been produced around the world. This would fit into a cube measuring about 430 meters on a side. Identified deposits contain an estimated 2.1 billion metric tons of additional copper, which brings the total amount of discovered copper to 2.8 billion metric tons. This would fit into a cube measuring 680 meters on a side.

## Cobalt mines in usa-freiheit
This region is known as the copper belt and cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper mining. The majority (around 65-85%) of all cobalt mined in the DRC comes from large scale copper mines that are mostly operated by large multinational mining companies. The operations in these mines are strictly controlled by the operators and local governments.

## ORE RESERVE ESTIMATION - WORKED EXAMPLE - Basic Mining Techniques
The simple yet accurate ore reserve estimation technique used is classical methods. Classical methods employ simple geometric function and rules that are easily applied to simple uncomplicated orebodies. In the following example, we will be working through the classical methods in determining the tonnage and grade of the Minetechpg Copper Deposit.

## Growing Global Copper Resources, Reserves and  - GeoScienceWorld
Copper is vital to modern life and has an often-irreplaceable role in everyday infrastructure and technology. However, while the planet's Cu endowment is finite, global Cu production continued to increase over the past century—a growth that has been matched by significant growth in estimated Cu mineral reserves and mineral resources.
