## Rotary Reverberatory Furnace (Anode Furnace)-Pyrometallurgy- - Metalcess
Description. Rotary reverberatory furnace, also named as anode furnace, is especially used to treat copper scrap (Cu 92% and above) to get copper anode (Cu 99%), which can be further purified by electrorefining to produce 99.99% Cu cathode. The copper cathode can be processed by upward casting machine to standard copper rod.

After the bleeding phase has passed, your dog will stay fertile till the end of the cycle, which is about 2~3 weeks. If you want to look at it just by using numbers, the entire cycle usually takes at least 15 days or at most a whole month. Since the bleeding phase can take up to 1~2 weeks, the remaining days in that cycle are still fair game.

## Pyrometallurgical Processing of Secondary Lead Material: An Industry 
Short rotary furnaces are operated as batch furnaces. For this reason, ramping up the production is limited by furnace size. Sizing up is achieved by operating several unit in parallel. As a result, capital costs are relatively high for this type of furnace. Most rotary furnaces used for lead recycling are short rotary furnaces.

## Lead Battery Recycling Process Steps by Steps - Pilot Industries
The lead received from Rotary Furnace (smelting) is called hard lead /crude lead. The lead tapped from the furnace has to be cleaned from residual oxides and slag. After stirring for a while all the impurities settle at the surface and are skimmed off. Lead recovered via blast furnace contains a lot of contamination and undesired components.
