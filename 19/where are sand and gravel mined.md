## Sand mining and Long Island groundwater
For over a century, sand and gravel from Long Island has been used to provide raw materials to develop and maintain infrastructure for the local area and New York City, according to the DEC. In 1975, the Mined Land Reclamation Law (MLRI) was passed to provide more consistency in mining regulation.
