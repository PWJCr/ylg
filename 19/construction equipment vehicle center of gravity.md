However many slings are needed, based on number of lifting points, make sure that half the slings will carry the full load. Depending upon existing conditions, you don't always have to lift right above the c.g., the piece will tilt a bit and align the c.g. with the hook above, as long as this doesn't become a stability problem.

I have never seen the "coordinates" for the center of gravity published anywhere. For a car, it would be an extremely complex calculation that only the manufacturer could model using advanced software. Thus, it's not something that can be easily measured by third parties (unlike ground clearance, 0-60 times, weight, etc.).

Hang a plumbline (a weight on a string) from the same point. Draw a line parallel to the string (yellow). 2) Now pick a different point on the edge and repeat the process.

## Vehicles' center of gravity and mass play a role in accidents
The sheer mass of these large vehicles do provide an advantage in a crash situation, as is unfortunately illustrated by the fact that the one fatality in this recent rollover accident was the driver of the smaller vehicle. However, the higher center of gravity of SUVs, large trucks and buses means that people driving these vehicles are at a

##  Measuring a Centre of Gravity of an Object using 4 Load  - IJERT
This equipment is capable for measuring weight and centre of gravity in a single setup. Instrument measure a weight of any object using a load cell of 1 Ton (2 nos.) and 3 Ton (2 nos.) capacity and coordinates of three  Locating the centre of gravity of a vehicle is important for anticipating the vehicle's behaviour in different situations.
