The separation effect of heavy medium gravity separation is mainly determined by the density of the ore particles, and the influence of the size and shape of the ore particles is small, so the separation precision is relatively high, the minerals with a small difference in density (such as 0.1 g/cm3) can be well separated.

Another method of concentration of ores is the Froth Flotation Method. This is the process for concentration of primarily sulphide ores. It has the advantage over gravity separation because it can collect even the extremely fine particles of minerals. The process uses the difference in the wetting characteristics of minerals and gangue.

Gravity Separation (Hydraulic Washing) In this method, the light (low specific gravity) earthy impurities are removed from the heavier metallic ore particles by washing with water. Therefore, it is used for the concentration of heavier oxide ores, like haematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), tinstone (SnO 2 ) and gold (Au).

The gravity separation technique is used to concentrate hematite ore. Iron oxide ore hematite is a common resource. Fe2O3 is the chemical formula for hematite. The ore of hematite is black or silver-grey in colour.

## Concentration of Ore - Definition, Methods of Separation, Examples 
Nov 28, 2021Question 2: Which is the concentration of ore process that is based on gravity separation? Answer: Gravity separation, also known as hydraulic washing, is a separation technique that uses the specific gravity variations between metallic ore and gangue particles to separate the two. Question 3: Give an example of a method for concentrating zinc
