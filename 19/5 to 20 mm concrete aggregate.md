Answer (1 of 2): Potentially, the drying shrinkage will be higher, as will be the heat evolved. Both due to a higher cement content. I am assuming that you want to replace the 20mm with 14 or 10mm coarse aggregate, and not just omitting the coarse aggregate entirely. Omitting any coarse aggrega

The goal of this study was to determine the angularity and roundness of particles for use in fine aggregate for Portland Concrete. To develop a new test method for evaluation of fine aggregate in Portland Cement concrete, an instrument called the "Camsizer P4" was used for fine-particle size and shape analyses.

## What Is Grading Of Aggregates? And Its Limits [Civil Planets]
The grading of aggregates is the determination of the aggregate size used for construction works. The coarse aggregate is graded as per its size (10mm, 12mm & 20mm). The selection of the right coarse aggregate size depends on the specific construction activity. You will understand how grading of aggregates influences the bondage in concrete

## Aggregates for Concrete - GreenSpec
- Coarse aggregates are particulates that are greater than 4.75mm. The usual range employed is between 9.5mm and 37.5mm in diameter. - Fine aggregates are usually sand or crushed stone that are less than 9.55mm in diameter. • Typically the most common size of aggregate used in construction is 20mm. A larger size, 40mm, is more common in mass

Depending on the mix design, either can be used to make essentially any range of concrete strengths. When you use a smaller aggregate, such as the 10mm as your nominal coarse aggregate size, the specific surface area of the total volume of coarse aggregate is much higher than for the 20mm aggregate.
