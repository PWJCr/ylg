The entire damp industry relies on what I call the Ping Prong meter - or in the industry, its known as a damp meter, moisture meter or protimeter. THIS is the culprit - a piece of electronic gadgetry that does NOT measure water content - it measures conductivity.

## Soil Moisture Content - PCTE
The UTS-0150 Universal Moisture Tester (Carbide Meter) uses the calcium carbide method to determine the moisture content of soil. The soil sample is placed into the bottle with the reagent. The water reacts with the calcium carbide and develops a gas pressure, which is displayed on the manometer and easily converted into percentage of moisture.

Moisture content is generally used as the end measurement in production, he said, but water activity gives tighter control and will find increased use at line, if not online. There are many methods for determination of moisture content. The primary methods used are loss on drying and Karl Fischer titration.

## How Does Moisture Content Affect Coffee Roasters?
There is no direct link between a coffee's quality and its moisture content. A 10% humidity coffee is not necessarily better or worse than a 12% coffee. However, over time, green coffee will gradually lose vibrance. This will eventually result in the dreaded "past crop" flavor, and this process is associated with the drying out of the coffee.

Wood moisture content between 0% and about 28% is dependent upon the relative humidity (RH) of the air. As the air's RH increases, so does the moisture content of any wood exposed to the air. Wood exposed to air with a RH of about 90% will reach a Wood Moisture Content of about 20%. Above 90% RH or 20% WMC, mold can grow on the wood.

## Does the moisture content of the stone affect the raymond mill?
in the process of grinding stone by high pressure pulverizer, if the water content of stone is too large, it is easy to cause the powder to stick in the grinding chamber due to the high humidity when the stone is crushed.as more and more stone powder is attached, the rotation speed and pressure of the raymond mill will become larger and larger, .
