## coal mining | Definition, History, Types, & Facts | Britannica
Originally driven by compressed air and later electrified, it could begin at one end of a long face (the vertical, exposed cross section of a seam of coal) and cut continuously to the other. Development of continuous mining Discover the challenges faced by coal miners and the changes to the industry between 1917 and 2017

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
Longwall mining involves the full extraction of coal from a section of the seam, or 'face' using mechanical shearers. The coal 'face' can vary in length from m. Self-advancing, hydraulically-powered supports temporarily hold up the roof while coal is extracted. When coal has been extracted from the area, the roof is allowed to

## Variability of Exposure and Estimation of Cumulative Exposure in a 
This study aims at estimating variability in exposure to respirable dust and assessing whether the a priori grouping by job team is appropriate for an exposure-response study on respiratory effects among workers in a manually operated coal mine in Tanzania. Furthermore, estimated exposure levels were used to calculate cumulative exposure.
