## power usage in coal mills
Coal Power - Eskom. South Africa's coal reserves are estimated at 53 billion tonnes, and with our present production rate there should be almost 200 years of coal supply left. Producing electricity from coal starts when the coal is pulverised in huge mills into a fine powder before it is blown into huge kettles, called boilers.

Thermal power plants use different types of coal pulverizers. The method used is attrition, impact, or a combination of both. This article explains the characteristics of the three main types- attrition, impact and attrition, and impact or hammer. Selection of the type of pulverizer depends on the grindability of the coal, the capital costs and maintenance costs, and considerations for licensing.
