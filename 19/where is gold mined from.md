## How Much Gold Is in the World? Find Out! | U.S. Money Reserve
More than 40 percent of all of the gold mined around the world has come from the Witwatersrand Basin mine in South Africa. In 1970, the mine accounted for almost 80 percent of global gold production. But after more than a century as the world's top gold producer, the country has slipped. In 2006, the country put out 8.75 million ounces of gold.
