Importance of aggregate grading. Ideally coarse and fine aggregate should be graded in such a way as to minimise the voidage. After compaction the volume of the cement paste must be more than the voidage between particles. Underfilling will result in entrapped air and an unworkable mix. An extreme example of this is a no-fines concrete where

##  Influence of Aggregate Characteristics on Concrete Performance
aggregate modulus and concrete coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to aggregate CTE, weak correlations were generally obtained between a single aggregate characteristic and concrete performance properties. Models to predict 28-d compressive strength based on the aggregates' CTE (and aggregate absorption in the case of the ternary blend

## importance of grading of aggregates
importance of aggregate grading in concrete mixdesign. Aggregate Factors Affecting the Grading of Aggregate, Grading is thus of vital importance in proportioning of concrete mixes, but its exact role in mathe 173 matical terms is not still fully known Finally it can be said that ensuring a constant grading is far more important than devising a good grading, otherwise variable workability will
