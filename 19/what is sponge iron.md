## Sponge Iron - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Sponge iron. Removing oxygen from the ore by a natural process produces a relatively small percentage of steels in the world. This process uses less energy and is a natural chemical reaction method. The process involves heating the naturally occurring iron oxide in the presence of carbon, which produces " sponge iron." In this process, the
