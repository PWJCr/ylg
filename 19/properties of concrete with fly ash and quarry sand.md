## Benefits of Fly Ash Concrete - CivilJungle
Fly Ash contains very small particles that make the concrete very thick and decreases the permeability of concrete. It could bring more power to the house. The concrete mixture produces a very low hydration heat, which avoids thermal cracking. Fly Ash concrete is immune to acid and sulfate attacks. The shrinkage of fly ash concrete is even smaller.

The properties of sand were found in laboratory as per procedure given in IS 383:1970[10] and values were given in Table 2. Table 2. Physical properties of sand and quarry dust S. No Description River sand Quarry dust

## properties of concrete with fly ash and quarry sand
concrete using industrial waste such fly ash, quarry dust, polymer and silica. One of the methods is to mix the quarry dust with the concrete. In this research, a quarry dust waste was added in the different proportion by weight of cement. The effect of quarry dust as a sand replacement in concrete were investigated 36 numbers with

## Benefits of Fly Ash Concrete - CivilJungle
Fly Ash in Concrete. Fly ash in concrete provides good use of portal cement hydration products. Calcium as well as alkali hydroxide solutions, that are emitted into the porous system of the paste, mix with fly ash particles, creating a cement medium, and the heat generated by hydration of portal cement is a significant factor in the initiation of a fly ash reaction.
