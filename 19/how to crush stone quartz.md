## How much force is needed to break a cubic meter of stone?
You can break it by using the old and well known method of wood wedges inserted into cracks in the rock: once you wet the wedges, the rock will break. If you try to crush the rock instead of pull it, the resistance is much higher, from 42 Megapascals for the same limestone up to 167 Megapascals for the same highly compressed sandstone.
