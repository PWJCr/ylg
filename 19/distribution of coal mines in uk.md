Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semi-hard coking-coal, semi-soft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

The planning system also makes it extremely difficult to bring forward new mine projects, despite the demand for coal. Total direct employment in the coal mining sector at the end of 2018 was 647 (130 at deep mines and 517 at surface mines). The industry's sole trade association is the Association of UK Coal Importers and Producers (CoalImP).

Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.
