## Compressive Strength of Concrete Block: Everything You Should Know
Jun 12, 2022For concrete blocks, the compressive strength is typically around 17.5 N/mm2 or 2500 psi. This means that the blocks can support a load of up to 17.5 N per square millimeter before they start to crack. Compressive strength is tested to determine how much compression a concrete block structure can endure.

The compressive strength is measured by breaking cylindrical concrete specimens in a compression-testing machine. The compressive strength is calculated from the failure load divided by the cross-sectional area resisting the load and reported in units of pound-force per square inch (psi) in US Customary units or megapascals (MPa) in SI units.

If used with Type N mortar, any C90 unit can be used for projects having f'm values up to 1,350 psi (9.3 MPa). Conversely, if the concrete masonry units have compressive strengths of 2,800 psi (19.3 MPa), then the maximum f'm used in design would be 2,000 psi (13.8 MPa) if Type M or S mortar were used.

COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH • Compressive strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand axially directed pushing forces. • When the limit of compressive strength is reached, brittle materials are crushed. • The compressive strength is used to determine the hardness of cubical and cylindrical specimens of concrete. 3.

Compressive strength of concrete blocks pdf. Three random blocks were selected from each type and tested under compression in a 2000 kN capacity compression testing machine. AS/NZS 4456 [] was followed to determine the compressive strengths of the concrete blocks.Both types of blocks (SB and HB) were tested with face shell capping and full capping as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), to correlate
