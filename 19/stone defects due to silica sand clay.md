The types of materials include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane, polyester, and the different forms of polyimide. When choosing an insulation material, polyimide is used with applications that reach temperatures of up to 250° C. During the winding process, the wires are heated such that the insulation materials bind together.

## What Is Silica Sand & How Is It Different From Regular Sand?
Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it

fusion is a thin crust with a brittle, glassy appearance firmly joined to the casting. This is caused when sand grains are fused with molten metal. It takes place when molten metal with extreme hot velocity is poured and low refractoriness of clay or sand. Silica sand is mostly used during casting due to its high refractoriness.

## Biogenic silica nanoparticles from agro-waste: Properties, mechanism of 
Silica can be naturally found in sand, gravel and diatomaceous earth (Fazlul et al., 2013) whereas the most common form of manufactured silica is in form of glass.  Silica nanoparticles show optical properties because of the point defects generated due to imperfect continuous network of SiO 4  Amorphous clay-based silica is a common
