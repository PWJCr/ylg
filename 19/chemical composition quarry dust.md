Quarry dust collected from a granite quarry is used. Its chemical composition is given in Table 1. There are more silicates in quarry dust and compared to other compounds. It is expected that the silicates improves the bonding process in the pelletisation process. The quarry dust contains silica (SiO 2) about 87%.

In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle ≥45°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.
