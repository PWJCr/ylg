## How Abundant Is Nickel - Realonomics
How Abundant Is Nickel? Nickel is the fifth most abundant element on Earth.However it is 100 times more concentrated below the Earth's crust than in it according to Chemicool. In fact nickel is believed to be the second most abundant element in the Earth's inner core with iron being the first by a large margin.

Nickel. Nickel (element #28, symbol Ni) is a silvery shiny, metallic element. It can be hammered into thin sheets, which means it is malleable. Nickel was discovered in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. Iron, cobalt and nickel (numbers 26, 27 and 28 on the Periodic Table) are the only three elements known to be ferromagnetic (the strongest type

## Nickel Ores
Nickel Ores. The principal ores of nickel are magnetic nickeliferous pyrites, nickel arsenides (especially kupfer nickel, and nickel arseno-sulphide or grey nickel), and the hydrosilicates of nickel and magnesia. The first-named ore is simply magnetic pyrites containing a certain proportion of nickel sulphide, and is one of the most important.

The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a

## Lateritic nickel ore deposits
Nickel laterites are a very important type of nickel ore deposit. They are growing to become the most important source of nickel metal for world demand (currently second to sulfide nickel ore deposits ). Nickel laterites are generally mined via open cut mining methods. Nickel is extracted from the ore by a variety of process routes.

## How Nickel Got It's Name- The Unexpected Story - Cohen
When German miners exploring the Ore Mountains in the 17 th century came across "a pale brownish-red rock," they thought they knew exactly what they'd found: a new copper ore. What they'd really found was a previously unknown nickel ore, which is now known as "nickel arsenide" or "niccolite.". The miners tried to extract the copper, but couldn't get it done.

Nickel (Ni) is a hard and ductile silvery-white lustrous transition metal. Pure native nickel is found in tiny amounts in Earth's crust, usually in ultramafic rocks. The use of nickel has been traced as far back as the 3500BCE and was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751, where it was mistook as a copper mineral. Nickel can be acquired in the mod by smelting an Olivine crystal
