## Grinding Corn to Make Homemade Cornmeal - Grit
Homemade cornmeal is easy to make if you can source some nice and hopefully open-pollinated corn and have access to a home-sized mill. I've used our old C.S. Bell No. 2 mill for grinding corn for making coarse meal for the chickens; it's also possible to make fine cornmeal with that mill using multiple passes.

## How to Make Cornmeal - Alphafoodie
The Steps For Grinding Popcorn Kernels Into Cornmeal. Place the corn kernels in a blender or seed grinder and grind. The first go-around will yield some uneven pieces so sieve the powder into a bowl and then re-grind the larger pieces. You may need to go for a third grind/ blend.

Boil the corn. Add the corn into the lime water, stirring gently. Use a slotted spoon and remove any kernels that float to the top of the water. Allow the water to boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. If you are making the dough for tortillas, allow to boil 2 minutes.

## How to Make Masa Harina - Homemade Dried Tortilla Dough | Hank Shaw
The one you absolutely need is the corn grinder. Finding alternate devices that grind wet corn isn't easy. A cheaper alternative to a dehydrator would be to dry the ground corn in a low oven, or, better, in a hot garage or in hot shade. The lower the temperature you can dry the corn at, the better the flavor.

Step 1: Bring water to a boil. Lots of water is the first secret you need to know. Pour 1 quart of water per ear into your largest pot; the more room the better. In fact, if you're cooking a lot of corn, go ahead and use two or more pots. Bring the water to a full rolling boil.

The body of the grain mill should be durable enough to withstand the weight of the hopper and grain. It should also be able to take the friction created by the rollers without falling apart. Hand sized grain mills can be made of wood or even plastic. Larger mills can be made with cement frames, wood, metal, or stone.
