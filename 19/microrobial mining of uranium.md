The increase in soluble uranium concentrations is in contrast to what has been seen during biostimulation of iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria at other uranium-contaminated sites (3, 27). Our results show that site-specific geochemistry and variable in situ microbial communities can affect the success of biostimulation as a strategy for the

For the past 2 years, the Mining Expo was on hold because of Covid-19. It finally happened and I was honoured to be part of it by representing our company, Reptile Mineral Resources and Exploration, at this Year's Mining Expo which took place in Windhoek, Namibia from the 31st of August to the 1st of September 2022. The experience was Gneiss.

Jul 29, 2022Radiation Facts. Regardless of how uranium is removed from rock, the extraction process creates radioactive wastes. If not managed properly, mining waste and mill tailings can contaminate the environment. Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element that has been mined and used for its chemical properties for more than a thousand years.

## Microbial Mining
Microbial Mining. This website is dedicated to the use of microbes in the mining of metals such as Iron, Copper and Uranium. In short, the main use of microbes in mining is in microbial leaching. This is the process whereby a microbe will reduce or oxidise an insoluble metal into a soluble form, which can then be extracted and used by us.

## Microbiological leaching of uranium ores | SpringerLink
Microbiological leaching has been used as an alternative approach to conventional hydrometallurgical methods of uranium extraction. In the microbiological leaching process, iron-oxidizing bacteria oxidize pyritic phases to ferric iron and sulfuric acid, and uranium is solubilized from the ore due to sulfuric acid attack.

## Role of skin in homeostasisnglow.shop
Skin functions in homeostasis include protection, regulation of body temperature, sensory reception, water balance, synthesis of vitamins and hormones, and absorption of materials. The skin's primary functions are to serve as a barrier to the entry of microbes and viruses, and to prevent water and extracellular fluid.

## Microbial communities associated with uranium in-situ recovery mining 
A large fraction (47%) of the world's uranium is mined by a technique called "In Situ Recovery" (ISR). This mining technique involves the injection of a leaching fluid (acidic or alkaline) into a uranium-bearing aquifer and the pumping of the resulting solution through cation exchange columns for the recovery of dissolved uranium.
