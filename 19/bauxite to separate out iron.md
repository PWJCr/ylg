## USA - Production of bauxite and aluminium chloride of low iron 
Removal of iron from aluminous material such as bauxite is effected by treatment with a gas mixture comprising sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide in a first step, followed by chlorination in a second step whereby ferric chloride is produced and removed by volatilization. Aluminium chloride of low iron content may be obtained from the purified aluminous material by chlorination.

Aug 12, 2022The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

Bauxite is a soft limonite iron ore rock with portions of its iron composition replaced by aluminum. Bauxite forms when silica leaches out from laterite soil. Bauxite does not exhibit any particular composition instead it is just an assortment of clay minerals, aluminum hydroxides, and hydrous aluminum oxides.

## Lateritic Bauxite Deposits - Our Largest Source of Aluminum
Most of the world's aluminium is mined from lateritic bauxite deposits. The largest producer is Australia's Weipa Mine in northern Queensland, while other countries with large reserves include Guinea, Vietnam, and Jamaica. Formed in a similar manner to iron laterites, bauxite is created by weathering of suitable rocks in a tropical climate.

## Does bauxite cause cancer?145
Red mud is a toxic byproduct of the industrial process that refines bauxite, raw aluminum ore, into aluminum oxide, or alumina. (Alumina is put through a separate process, electrolysis, to make aluminum metal.)  It can be slightly radioactive if the original bauxite contained radioactive minerals.

The Bayer Process, which is used by about 80 active plants worldwide, is the primary method of producing aluminum from bauxite. Bauxite ore is dissolved in sodium hydroxide, or lye, at a high temperature and pressure. Then, the alumina and bauxite ores are separated by washing out the waste (red muds or sands) from the alumina.

The Bayers process for chemical dissolution of bauxite is associated with a selective precipitation of iron oxide. This has been referred to as red-mud due to the color of its primary constituent iron (III) oxide (hematite). Iron oxide in conjunction with the Desilication product (DSP) constitute the red-mud (or Bauxite residue/BR) [1-4].
