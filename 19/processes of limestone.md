Step five: The carbonic acid eats away at rock by dissolving the limestone. Step six: A cave passage is formed. Caves are also formed in other ways. Wind and waves can form caves along the shoreline in soft rock formations. Wind and rain can erode limestone that lay under a hard layer of rock, forming a cave.

## processes of a limestone
Limestone Production Process. As stated above, limestone can used in three forms and as a result the limestone will go though several processes. Here are the basic processes: quarrying of limestone, washing and selecting limestone for further uses, grinding of limestone, calcination of limestone, and slaking of quicklime.

process dissolves calcite and releases calcium. CaCO3 + H2CO3 = Ca2+ + 2HCO3- The calcium is removed by water carrying it away (leaching). The process is accelerated, since the temperature of the area is high and water is plentiful. The quartz, if present in the limestone, will not break down because of its resistance to weathering.

## processes of limestone
Limestone rock is a sedimentary rock which forms in the process of sedimentation at the bottom of lakes and oceans, or in caves. It is mainly composed of mineral calcite and aragonite, both of which are crystal forms of calcium carbonate. A limestone with 95 percent or more of calcium carbonate by weight is known as a high-calcium limestone.

While limestone caves form through chemical or solution weathering, other types form through erosion, wind, waves, and other natural causes. For example, talus caves form from rocks and boulders piling up atop a mountain slope and leaving a small opening. Sea caves form from waves hitting against a cliff, causing it to erode.

## How Does Organic Limestone Form - Realonomics
How is limestone formed and where is it found? Most fresh water and sea water contain dissolved calcium carbonate. All limestones are formed when the calcium carbonate crystallizes out of solution or from the skeletons of small sea urchins and coral. .Such evaporation takes place in the hot lagoons of many coral reefs and in most shallow tropical seas.

Some limestones are formed in freshwater environments associated with caves (stalactites and stalagmites), springs (tufa and travertine) and lakes. Stalactites and stalagmites form in caves as water evaporates from calcium carbonate-rich waters that drip from the roof of the cave and onto the floor.

Why Does Limestone Dissolve? Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater which contains a weak carbonic acid reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. . Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere forms very dilute carbonic acid when it dissolves in rain.
