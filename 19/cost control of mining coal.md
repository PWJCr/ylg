## Mining costs demystified
Strictly Boardroom is a student of mining costs - and a long suffering one at that. Multiple cost definitions abound in the minerals sector, most of which don't help investors or managers a great deal at all. C1, C2 and C3 productions costs are quite popular with some miners - but as an experienced mining colleague recently suggested

## Mine Ventilation - Ventilation control of dust in coal mines - GRT
Ventilation control of dust in coal mines is important in the different types of underground coal mining such as (1) room and pillar mining, (2) longwall mining and (3) shaft mining. Type (1) is done in an ore deposit where some of the ore is left behind to form columns in the mine that prevents it from collapsing and it is used for coal mining
