## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite
Types of iron ore: Magnetite. With the chemical formula Fe3O4, magnetite ore has much lower iron content than hematite ore. That means it has to be concentrated before it can be used to produce steel. However, the ore's magnetic properties help separate magnetite ore from rock during concentration. Magnetite ore is currently mined in

## Three ores that are used as sources of iron are hematite, Fe2O3  - Quora
Answer (1 of 4): Fe2O3 .. 2(55.8) / ((2x55.8 + 3(16.0)) x 100 = 69.9% Fe3O4 .. 3(55.8) / ((3(5.8 + 4(16.0)) x 100 = 72.3% FeCO3 .. 55.8

## Top Iron Ore Producing Countries In The World - WorldAtlas
The bulk of these rocks are either Hematite or Magnetite, and it makes almost 98% of the iron ore produced worldwide that goes into making steel. Much of the iron ore mined are oxide compounds of Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), Hematite (Fe 2 O 3) Goethite (Fe 2 O 3 SH 2 O), and Limonite. Magnetite is composed of 72% iron, Hematite is 70% iron, Goethite
