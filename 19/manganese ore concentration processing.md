## Manganese Concentration Process
The fire enrichment process is simple and stable, and the iron and phosphorus in the ore can be effectively separated to obtain manganese-rich slag with low-iron and low-phosphorus. The manganese-rich slag generally contains 35% to 45% Mn, Mn/Fe 12-38, P/Mn<0.002, and is a high-quality raw material to manganese-based alloy.
