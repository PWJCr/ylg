## the characteristic iron iron ore
The world will need iron ore for as long as the world needs steel. In 2020, we produced around 280 million tonnes of iron ore. That's enough to make the steel for more than 3,300 Sydney Harbour Bridges. We're building a new iron ore mine in Western Australia. When completed, South Flank will produce high quality iron ore for around 25 years.

About 98% of world iron ore production is used to make iron in the form of steel. Iron in cast form has many specific uses (e.g. pipes, fittings, engine blocks) but pure iron is quite soft. Adding a small amount of carbon (usually less than 1%) makes iron into steel which is significantly harder and extremely versatile.

Iron was found in rocks called iron ore. Making iron from iron ore (smelting) needed very high temperatures.

Iron was harder than bronze, which had been used to make objects before.

At least 40,000 years ago, people obtained hematite, crushed it into a fine powder, and used it to make paints. Shown above are commercial hematite pigments that are available today.

The Melted Iron Ore is a material which was added in Mud Building update V.0.5.0 to Green Hell. Melted Iron Ore is a material which has multiple uses. It can be obtained from processing Iron Ore mined from caves or by melting Small Cans or Large Cans in the Mud Forge. Once processed, the Melted Iron Ore can be combined with molds to craft a number of tools and weapons.
