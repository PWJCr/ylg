## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Mortar uses slightly more water than concrete. You should be able to hold concrete in your hand and form it into a ball when it's properly mixed. Mortar, on the other hand, is too wet to hold a form. Most mortar mixes have a compressive strength of around 1500 psi. Although some go as high as 3500 psi.
