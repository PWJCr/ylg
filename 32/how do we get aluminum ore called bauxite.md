## Bauxite Ore
Bauxite is an aluminium ore and is the main source of aluminium. This form of rock consists mostly of the minerals gibbsite Al(OH) 3, boehmite γ-AlO(OH), and diaspore α-AlO(OH), in a mixture with the two iron oxides goethite and hematite, the clay mineralkaolinite, and small amounts of anatase TiO 2.Bauxite was named after the village Les Bauxin southern France, where it was first recognised

## During extraction of aluminium from bauxite?
What ore is aluminium extracted from? Aluminium can be extracted (uneconomically) from some clays but the most common aluminium ore is a material called bauxite. First the aluminium ore needs to be mined, then the bauxite is refined into alumina (aluminium oxide). Large amounts of electricity are used to smelt the alumina into aluminium metal.

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

Bauxite and iron ore are two such types that are found naturally on earth. Bauxite is also known as aluminum ore and contains aluminum bearing minerals. Iron ore is a type of rock from which we can extract iron. The main difference between bauxite and iron ore is that bauxite is a source of aluminum whereas iron ore is a source of iron.
