## water demand for potash salt mining process
The next step in the process is to separate the potash ore from the NaCl and remaining impurities. This is accomplished by flotation a process commonly used in mining concentrators for many minerals in the mining industry. Potash ore slurry of 20 40 by weight is prepared in a flotation tank by adding additional brine. Get Price; PDF

## Processing of potash ore
The hot leaching method of ore processing is based on the physicochemical properties of NaCl-KCl-H2O system. The main principle of this method is the different temperature-depending degree of solubility of the mineral components - sylvite and halite: the high solubility of potassium chloride from ore by cycling solution at 115°C and the further crystallization of the valuable component on

Potash is mined from deep underground deposits left by ancient inland seas. Such underground potash deposits like Picadilly can span a distance of approximately 10 km. Conveyors are the most effective way to convey material throughout the mine and to the production shafts, and from the production shafts to the processing plant.

Mining Machines: Potash is mined using two and four rotor continuous boring machines. They can mine up to 900 tonnes per hour, making paths of up to 7.9 metres wide and 3.7 metres high.  A process plant separates the salt from the potash and converts the potash to the final product, ready for storage & shipping. Conventional Solution Mining.

Potash is extracted from buried ancient evaporites by underground or solution mining. This accounts for most of the potassium produced. Another important source is brine from land-locked water bodies, such as the Dead Sea, Salar de Atacama or Great Salt Lake. About 95% of potash produced worldwide is used in agriculture.

The crystals of potash and salt are then sent to a facility to be separated through a flotation process. In 2013, the United States produced about 970,000 metric tons of potash, about two percent of global production. The fertilizer industry consumed about 85 percent of the potash produced by the United States; the chemical industry used the rest.

Potassium bearing minerals are mined from underground ore deposits or extracted from salt lakes and brines. (e.g. Great Salt Lake, Utah and the Dead Sea). These deposits were formed as ancient oceans evaporated, leaving behind concentrated salt layers that were subsequently buried by sediment. Most potash mines today are deep shaft mines.

Traditional potash extraction is carried out by either open cast drag-mining, or subsurface solution mining. Typically, solution mining requires large evaporation ponds at surface to concentrate the potash brought up from below so that it can be extracted. These ponds are often dyed a spectacular blue colour to enhance evaporation Figures 1 and 3).
