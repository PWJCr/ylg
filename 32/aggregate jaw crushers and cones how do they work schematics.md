## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
A first-stage crusher, such as an impact or jaw crusher is used to break raw material down to a size that the cone crusher can accommodate. Cone crushers are typically looked at as a secondary or tertiary stage of crushing. But, they can also act as the first stage provided the material is small enough to fit through the feed opening.

## How does a Single Toggle Jaw Crusher work? | RUBBLE MASTER
Typically, jaw crushers produce less fine material than impact crushers. The reduction ratio of a jaw is approx. 4 to 1. Fines are necessary to meet certain gradations and increase material compaction. This is the reason why a jaw crusher is predominenatly used as a primary crusher for an intial reduction in size or to produce a non-spec material.

## Jaw Crushers, How Do They Work?
A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing stations.
