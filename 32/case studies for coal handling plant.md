##  Failure of Dust Suppression System at Coal Handling Plant of Koradi 
At Coal Handling Plants Of Thermal Power Stations - A Case Study - By Makarand Joshi 1.0 Abstract: - Many thermal power plants use coal as their fuel. To handle the coal, each power station is equipped with a coal handling plant. The coal has to be sized, processed, and handled which should be done effectively and efficiently.
