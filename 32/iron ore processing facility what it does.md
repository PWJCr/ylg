## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

A taconite iron ore processing facility separates and concentrates iron ore from taconite, a low-grade iron ore, and produces taconite pellets, which are approximately 60 percent iron and about Â½ inch in diameter. These pellets are then utilized, mainly, in blast furnaces making iron and steel and in the cement industry. Rule History

## Ore Processing | OceanaGold - Waihi Operation
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. These rocks are usually found in the form of hematite (Fe2O3) or magnetite (Fe3O4). About 98% of world iron ore production is used to make iron in the form of steel. Nearly all of Earth's major iron ore deposits are in rocks that formed over 1.8 billion years ago.

## What are the iron ore tailings application technology
Hanxing high-calcium-magnesium iron Tailings. Such tailings are mainly concentrated in the Hanxing area, such as Yushiwa, Xishimen, Yuquanling, Fushan, Wangjiazi and other concentrators. The main associated elements are S, Co and trace amounts of Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, As, etc. Au, Ag, etc., the content of -0.047mm grain size accounts for 50% to 70%; 4.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
