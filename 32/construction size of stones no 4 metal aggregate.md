## Characteristics of Good Building Stone | Construction Aggregate 
Specific gravity of a good building stone lies between 2.4 to 2.8. Hardness: When stones are utilized for floors, pavements, aprons of bridges and weirs of rivers, the stones are subjected to abrasive forces which are caused by the wear and friction. Hence the stones which are to be used in such places should be tested for hardness.
