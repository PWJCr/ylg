## Cone Crusher, Stone Rock Crusher Machine - JXSC Mining
Cone crusher is a compression type of rock size reducing machine that crushes rock & stone material by the physical compression force forming by the fixed steel and the moving steel. The final discharge particle size is determined by the interval between the fixed member and the moving member at the lowest point of the discharge opening.
