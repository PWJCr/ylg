For example, depending on the region of the United States, crushed stone in the size of a few mm to 2 inches is referred to as "gravel," even if it has been crushed and is no longer smooth. To provide clarity and avoid confusion, we will stay with the definition that gravel cannot refer to crushed stone and must remain in a natural state.
