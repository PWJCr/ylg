## Extraction of Nickel | Nickel Ore Mining | Mining Equipment for Sale
The extraction of nickel process generally consists of crushing, sieving, washing, re-selection, grinding, and slurry concentration, or the nickel leaching method. The target element nickel distribution varies with the nature of the ore, mostly contained in fine-grained grades. For example, the nickel minerals of the Ramu laterite mine in Papua

## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Open-pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface. If the deposit apexes below the surface, the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open-pit mining. The removal of this material is known as stripping. The stripping-pit limits must be extended beyond the

O pen Pit Mining also called open-cut or open-cast mining, is surface mining technique of extracting minerals or rock from beneath the earth, often dug in an open area. This type of mining is one of the numerous varieties of surface mining that has been used since ancient times for different types of minerals. It involves large amounts of rock and is therefore expensive to produce.

## ore equipment used in open pit copper mining
Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.
