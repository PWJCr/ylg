A jaw crusher size is obtained by looking at its feed opening (gape) and length. As an example, a monster 7959 of 79″ x 59″ (2m x 1.5m) will have its fixed jaws 79″ apart where the feed enters on a 59″ wide set of liner plates. The factors list below will enhance crusher capacity and performance: 1. Proper selection of the jaws.

## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
A Jaw Crusher uses compressive force for breaking material. This mechanical pressure is achieved by the crusher's two jaws dies, one of which is stationary and the other is movable. These two vertical manganese jaw dies create a V-shaped cavity called the crushing chamber, where the top of the crushing chamber is larger than the bottom.
