## What is the Cost of Mining Gold? - Visual Capitalist
The price of gold is up by around 50% since 2016, and it's hovering near the all-time high of $2,000/oz. That's good news for gold miners, who achieved record-high profit margins in 2020. For every ounce of gold produced in 2020, gold miners pocketed $828 on average, significantly higher than the previous high of $666/oz set in 2011.

Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid. The low melting point thus enables gold to be extracted using a cost effective, low power heat sources to bring about melting.

The mineral is inexpensive and easily available, and the miners have found that more gold is recovered through its use, as discussed below.

This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore, including gold.

In gold refinement, Dehybor® anhydrous borax is used in flux formulations to dissolve metal oxides and as a flux in gold assaying. The addition of Dehybor to the smelt is generally 10-50% of total smelt weight, depending on the process. The borax contribution to flux composition can be up to 60% of total flux weight but is typically around 30-40%.
