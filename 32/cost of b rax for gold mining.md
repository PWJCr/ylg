## What is the Cost of Mining Gold? - Visual Capitalist
The price of gold is up by around 50% since 2016, and it's hovering near the all-time high of $2,000/oz. That's good news for gold miners, who achieved record-high profit margins in 2020. For every ounce of gold produced in 2020, gold miners pocketed $828 on average, significantly higher than the previous high of $666/oz set in 2011.

If you had gold, it's still there buried in the dark borax glass. So don't throw it out. Refining with borax is a bit of a misnomer, using it on a concentrate is more of a recovery method. You won't get .999 gold that way, as in, "refined" gold.

Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid. The low melting point thus enables gold to be extracted using a cost effective, low power heat sources to bring about melting.

## Gold Mining With Borax
Aug 03, 2017Â· Borax had its heyday during the 1880s, then Death Valley mining briefly boomed again during the early 1900s with the discoveries of gold at Bullfrog, Skidoo, and Chloride Cliff. But the financial panic of 1907 slowed or stopped most mining, and according to the park service, virtually all metallic mining operations shut down by 1915.

The mineral is inexpensive and easily available, and the miners have found that more gold is recovered through its use, as discussed below.

This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore, including gold. While out in the field, a gold prospector can grind and wash a piece of ore, then mix it with borax in a plastic bag. The bag is then placed in a bowl or crucible and heated.

## Borates in Metallurgy and Gold Refinement | U.S. Borax
In gold refinement, DehyborÂ® anhydrous borax is used in flux formulations to dissolve metal oxides and as a flux in gold assaying. The addition of Dehybor to the smelt is generally 10-50% of total smelt weight, depending on the process. The borax contribution to flux composition can be up to 60% of total flux weight but is typically around 30-40%.
