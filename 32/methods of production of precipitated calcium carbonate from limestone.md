## Performance of Separation Processes for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate 
An alternative production concept for calcium carbonate production is being developed that omits the need for fresh limestone and its calcination (Eloneva et al., 2009). This concept has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions and simultaneously utilize steelmaking slag. In this process, calcium is selectively extracted from steelmaking slag

Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. As an alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air.  The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite

## Production of precipitated calcium carbonate from calcium silicates and 
When calcium and carbonate ions have formed calcium carbonate and precipitated, the solution will be below saturation and more calcium hydroxide can dissolve. The commercially available carbonation process for PCC production is an example of this practice: the solid content of the slurry in the carbonation reactor is as high as 20% [17] .

##  Production of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (Pcc) Using  - Core
In present commercial practice, precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is normally manufactured by reacting the „milk of lime‟ with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in a stirred tank batch reactor system. The drawback of this technique is PCC could not be produced uninterrupted for the required quantity in a real time process continuously.
