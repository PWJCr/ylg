Cold vulcanizing is to use vulcanized material such as patches and strips to repair a conveyor belt. Cold vulcanization does not use a press but uses a bonding agent like TRS cold adhesive, which causes a chemical reaction to splice the two belt ends together. Cold vulcanization means that you can finish your vulcanization at ambient temperature.

Vulcanization is a complex procedure that, if done correctly by an expert, can offer a smooth splice with minimal risk of snagging, tearing and other harmful wear to the belt. There are several types of vulcanized splice, including stepped splices, finger splices and overlap splices, and two types of vulcanizing processes, hot and cold.
