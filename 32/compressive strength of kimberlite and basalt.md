What Is The Strongest Rock In The World? The strongest rock in the world is diabase followed closely by other fine-grained igneous rocks and quartzite. Diabase is strongest in compression tension and shear stress. If mineral hardness is the determining factor of strength then diamond is technically the strongest rock in the world.

## mpressive strength of kimberlite and basalt
What Is The Compressive Strength Of Basalt. Basalt Rock Properties and Uses - Science Struck. The rock hardness of basalt is 6 on the Mohs scale, and can be seen through a combination of its compressive strength: Mpa (Megapascal), its tensile strength: 10-30 Mpa, and its shear strength: 20-60 Mpa, which denotes that depending on the mineral makeup, basalt rocks fall in the strong
