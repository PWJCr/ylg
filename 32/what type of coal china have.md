## What is coking coal, and where is it used? - Kalkine Media
When heated, coking coal creates coke, which is a key material for the production of steel. There are many varieties of coal, ranging from anthracite, bituminous, lignite, peat to brown coal, but the unique caking ability of metallurgical coal makes it different from other forms of coal.

## How Is China's Energy Footprint Changing? | ChinaPower Project
As China's economy has grown, its demand for coal has surged. From 1990 to 2019, China's coal consumption nearly quadrupled from 1.06 billion million metric tons of coal to 4.02 billion metric tons, and since 2011, China has consumed more coal than the rest of the world combined. As of 2020, coal made up 56.8 percent of China's energy use.
