## Commercial bauxite mining's high cost for Malaysian communities
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission seized about 10 million tonnes of bauxite in August 2017. The commission estimated the stockpile to be worth $306 million. The socioeconomic impacts of bauxite mining in Kuantan are among the concerns expressed by observers. Bauxite is not renewable and can be taken out once.

## Guinea's bauxite mining development | CRU
By 2040, the capacity gap was expected to increase to 83 Mt, demonstrating a long-term need for investment in bauxite mining capacity. In the early 2020s, however, we expected a short-term global surplus of bauxite as the result of mine ramp-ups in Guinea (including our client's project), in Australia to a lesser degree and in China.

Impact of COVID-19 on Global bauxite mining . Global bauxite production grew by a significant percentage in 2020, supported by higher production from the world's second-largest producer, Guinea, with an increase in production in 2020. Meanwhile, production from Brazil and Indonesia was reported to have increased.

## bauxite: Govt mulls changes in pricing structure to determine average 
The government is considering changes in the pricing structure to ascertain the Average Selling Price of metallurgical grade bauxite in order to attract private players in the sector. At present, states are not able to auction the existing bauxite mines as companies find the selling price of the mineral unviable.
