The mix design process also lends us a mix ratio that defines the parts of sand and crushed stones to be added for 1 part of cement. It is generally expressed as; Mix Ratio = Cement : Fine Aggregates: Coarse Aggregates. For example, a mix design ratio of 1:2:4 indicates that for 1 part of cement, we have 2 parts of sand and 4 parts of crushed

## Manufacturing process
Step 1: Mining. The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded
