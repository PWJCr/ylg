Bentonite. Bentonite is the common name for naturally occurring clay that contains the active montmorillonite mineral. The special properties of montmorillonite that enable commercial applications include the sub-micron platelet structure, very high surface area (≈800 m2/g), and inherent negative charge in the platelet that is counter

Bentonite is used in retention systems and for the control of stickies and pitch. Furthermore, it helps to improve the loop water treatment which reduces water consumption. Bentonite is ideal for use in cat litter due to its unique water absorption, swelling, and odour-controlling properties. It is an excellent anti-caking agent for animal feed.

Bentonite also allows closer working to boundary lines. Bentonite is derived from montmorillonite clay and is usually supplied in paper bags as a finely ground, free flowing powder. Like portland cement, it must be stored under reasonably dry conditions. When the powder is dispersed in water it breaks down into a very fine colloidal clay.
