Dolomite countertops. Dolomite, also referred to as dolostone and dolomite rock, is a sedimentary rock. By weight, it contains more than 50 percent of the mineral dolomite. Dolomite's appearance is pearly or glassy. Dolomite forms naturally when limestone undergoes a chemical change after coming in contact with magnesium-rich groundwater.

In these tests, it was found that Dolomite provides the same mechanical properties and water impermeability in addition to compressive strength as the natural sad did; the incorporation of Dolomite by-products also improved the stability and workability of the mixes.

## Agricultural Limestone vs Dolomite - Braen Stone
Pros - Like aglime, dolomite is able to very effectively raise soil pH. At the same time, it's able to correct soil with a magnesium deficiency. For optimum health, sandy soil should have a calcium to magnesium ratio of 7:1 for sandy soil and 10:1 for clay-based soil. Cons - Dolomitic lime shouldn't be applied where it isn't needed.
