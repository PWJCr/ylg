## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill - mech4study
SAG is the abbreviated form for Semi-Autogenous Grinding Mill. This type of Mill is used for grinding large fragments into small pieces. Pieces are then used for further processing. The SAG mills are generally used in pre-processing of any type of material in grinding process. SAG mills are also known as first stage grinders.

## Simulation of Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) Mill using  - SlideShare
Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) Mill system is modeled based only on circular-shape objects, the liners and also the targetted grains. Molecular dynamics method is used to simulate the system. Considered forces are normal and gravitation forces. Sparisoma Viridi Follow Lehrer at Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia 1.
