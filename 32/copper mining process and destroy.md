## 33 Causes, Effects & Solutions for Mining - E&C
For mining purposes, big machines are often used in order to make the mining process more effective and to reduce the physical work for miners. However, these machines emit large amounts of harmful gases, also including greenhouse gases like methane or CO2. Thus, mining can also cause air pollution and the implied consequences.

## Does mining destroy our environment? - Quora
Answer (1 of 15): Of course, mining activities damages the environment. Open cast mines require the striping of the layers of overburden to get to the minerals. Underground mines, though less harmful than open cast, changes the geography of the region dramatically. See how the land has sunk in

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Mining remains an essential and growing part of the modern industry. By some estimates, it makes up nearly 45% of the total global economy, and mineral production continues to increase as demand for raw materials grows around the world.. However, many mining techniques still in use can have serious impacts on both the mining site itself and the surrounding environment.

Copper mining firms worldwide are committed to reducing their carbon emissions. Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper miners, lowered its carbon emissions by more than 21 percent from 2015 to 2019. This puts the company on track to meet the COP21 framework to limit global warming to below 2°C from pre-industrial levels by 2050.
