Appropriate beneficiation process has to be advanced to reduce the waste generation in mines and for the sustainable growth of the iron ore industry some. Major reason for difficulty in beneficiation of BHJ is revealed from characterization studies which show the intergrowth of haematite and quartz.

After setting a target of 100 mtyr of steel by 2012, indian steelmakers and iron ore producers are already struggling due to the depleted grade of iron ore available in india. the main impurities dominating the indian iron ores are sio2 and al2o3 which should be reduced with an

(iii) Blue Dust: Blue Dust is the name given to naturally occurring, extremely friable, high grade Haematite Iron Ore powder. D. Beneficiation of Ore: Very low grade Iron ore cannot be used in metallurgical plants and needs to be upgraded to increase the iron content and reduce the Gauge content.

## Impact of quality of iron ore lumps on sustainability of mining 
Moreover, the increased exploitation of BIFs has necessitated the introduction of new and specific beneficiation processes. For iron ore lumps, this change in source led to increases in the amounts of fines (owing to the greater fragility of BIFs compared to hematite ores) and the contents of Al 2 O 3 (owing to the contaminants found in clays
