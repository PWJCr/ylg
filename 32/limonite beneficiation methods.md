What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures) Ray Hawk Raw iron ore has to be purified for use. Iron ore beneficiation is a multi-stage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting, which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content.The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine it.

## hematite can be separated for magnetic separators
Minerals such as hematite, limonite, and garnet are weakly magnetic and can be separated from nonmagnetics by the use of highintensity separators Magnetic separation method is based on the difference of mineral magnetic, bearing different forces in the magnetic field of magnetic separator, resulting in material separationAfter hematite

## Magnetite Separation Machine Spiral Classifier the price of stone 
Spiral classifier is widely used for separating the sand in the ore beneficiation plant to equip with ball mill to form a closed cycle, for classifying ore sand and fine silt in the gravity separation plant, for the granularity classification of the pulp in the metal ore beneficiation .
