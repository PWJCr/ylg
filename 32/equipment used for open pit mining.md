Dr. Dyson Galatia. This study investigates the cause of the numerous open pit equipment accidents at X Mining Company (XMC) during the period January 2019 to December 2020. The motivation for this study came from the large number of equipment accidents occurring at the Mine despite the available safety and management interventions.

## Reading: Open-Pit Mining | Geology | | Course Hero
Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where

Why is open pit mining cheaper? Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc.

There are several different types of heavy equipment in use, particularly in open cut or surface mining. There are those that dig and gouge away at the material being mined, and there are those that push the mined material around. A third group are involved in the transportation of the mined materials. Excavators do a lot of the actual digging.

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

## May 1 Surface Mining Techniques used in the Oil Sands
Surface mining is defined as the extraction of ore from an open pit or burrow. Surface mining is sometimes known as open-pit, open-cut or open-cast mining and is only commercially viable if the deposit is located relative close to the surface. Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.

Open-pit mining is a type of surface mining used to extract coal, gold, and other minerals. It creates immense water and air pollution, disfigures landscapes, and destroys habitats.  When mining equipment malfunctions or when workers such as welders make mistakes, coal ignites. Mine fires release toxic gases and cause significant air pollution.
