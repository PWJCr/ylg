What Is a Rolling Mill? At its most basic principle, a rolling mill is a machine that reduces the thickness of a metal without sacrificing any of the material - meaning material is always displaced and never lost. By design and function, rolling mills do not generate scrap. The process of rolling affects the materials at a metallurgical level

From the point of view of mechanical design and manufacturing, the roller flour mill must meet the following three conditions: 1. Feeding material must be uniform. First, the feed hopper should be large enough, and then the feeding baffle should have a good sealing feature. 2. The roll clearance must be stable and controllable.

In this configuration, there are two horizontally mounted rolls. The rolling mill motor drives either both rolls (top and bottom) or only one roll (normally the bottom roll) with the top roll rotating due to the friction between the roll and the work piece.
