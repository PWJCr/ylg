## Coal Mining in India - ClearIAS
Mar 29, 2022Coal demand in the country is yet to peak as the Economic Survey projects coal demand in the range of 1.3-1.5 billion tonnes by 2030, an increase of 63 percent from the current demand. Thus, as of now, there is no scenario of energy transition away from coal affecting any stakeholders involved in coal mining.

At present, India's overall installed renewable capacity is 87.66 GW and of installed solar power capacity is around 35 GW. However, the push and focus on renewable do not mean India is cutting down its focus on coal. According to CIL, in the next five years, it is going to open 55 new coal mines and expand at least 193 present ones.
