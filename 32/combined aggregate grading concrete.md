## How to Blend Aggregate Using Fineness Modulus Value?
Step-4 (Calculating Ratio of Fine Aggregate to Coarse Aggregate) Let " x " is the percentage of fine aggregate to be combined with coarse aggregate. x can be calculated using the formula given below. x = [ (F2-F)/ (F-F1)]100. Where, F1 = Fineness modulus value of fine aggregate. F2 = Fineness modulus value of coarse aggregate.

If plotted in Zone II (denoted by a box, see page 83), a combined aggregate grading is considered optimal. Workability factor should be corrected for different cementitious content, e.g., a 94-lb. decrease in cementitious weight (from a standard cementitious content of 564 lb/yd 3) requires a 2.5 percent workability factor increase.

## Effects of combined aggregate gradation on the compression strength and 
Aggregate gradation (particle size distribution) is a very important part of concrete production hence the need to combine coarse aggregate with fine aggregate in its simplest form. An improperly graded aggregate structure can have undesirable effects on the properties of concrete as it can produce weak, stiff or porous concretes.

## Concrete for Pumping| Concrete Construction Magazine
When combined with the cement and water, fine aggregate provides the fluid (mortar) which conveys the large solids (coarse aggregate) in suspension, thus making a mix pumpable. The fine aggregate should meet gradation requirements of ASTM C33 as closely as possible to the middle of the grading range.

In the 1960s, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) came up with the '0.45 power' gradation chart for aggregates in concrete mix design. This was designed to give straight lines for maximum density gradations.  The ideal gradation for q = 0.22 and the combined grading obtained with available material are shown in Figure 8. Figure 8

aggregate have openings ranging from 150 µm to 9.5 mm (No. 100 sieve to . 3 ⁄ 8. in.). The 13 standard sieves for coarse aggregate have openings ranging from 1.18 mm to 100 mm (0.046 in. to 4 in.). Tolerances for the dimensions of open-ings in sieves are listed in ASTM E 11 (AASHTO M 92). Size numbers (grading sizes) for coarse aggregates

## Classes Of Aggregate Login Information, Account|Loginask
The most common classification of aggregates on the basis of bulk specific gravity is lightweight, normal-weight, and heavyweight aggregates. This section specifically address the different characteristics found in both lightweight and heavyweight aggregates. Table (1), Density Classification of Concrete Aggregates, Mindess

In 2005 the article "Effects of Aggregate Grading on Drying Shrinkage of Florida Concretes", by McCall, King & Whisonant, appeared in Concrete International. The NRMCA published a 2-part research study on "Effect of Continuous (Well-Graded) Combined Aggregate Grading on Concrete Performance".
