Drag chain - Primary mover in mechanical drag conveyor system; Flights - Attached to drag chain to push ash along stationary platform;  Most of the ash from a pulverized coal-fired boiler is carried through the boiler and air heater by the flue gas. As much as 50 to 70% of the ash generated by combustion of pulverized coal is removed

## Three Ways to Optimize Solid Fuel Combustion - Hurst Boiler
Screw conveyors prove to be much more effective than chain or belt conveyors. Flight geometry and auger casings allow feed rate projections to be much more accurate. Other types of conveyors are notorious for causing the fuel to "bridge" which leads to uneven layers of fuel on the furnace floor, causing inefficient combustion.
