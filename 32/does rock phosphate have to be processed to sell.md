## Phosphate Rock
Russian Deposits. World Production of Phosphate Rock. Apatite, the most abundant crystalline phosphate mineral, is found in igneous rocks and probably is the primary origin of all other phosphates, whether mineral or organic. Its chemical formula may be expressed as Ca5 (Cl,F) (PO4)3. The chlorine may be replaced almost entirely by the fluorine.

## Chemical Processing of Phosphate - Florida Poly
Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid. It is that acid that is used to make fertilizer.

In the past, rock phosphate was used to supercharge inorganic fertilisers like superphosphate — this is what most of the Australian miners are aiming their production for. To use the 'organic' raw form, poses a few problems. Phosphorus, the element, is not easy for plants to extract from soil generally and they take up between 5-20 per cent.

Rock phosphate and colloidal phosphate are both pulverized forms of the mineral apatite, generally by-products of a mining process, and slow-release forms of phosphorous. "Colloidal" simply refers to the particle size. Superphosphate is apatite that has been reacted with an acid, thereby changing the chemistry and concentrating the phosphorous.

Commercial fertilizer it is mostly soluble P (in the form of phosphate). Within 24 hours this soluble P starts being converted to labile P and eventually to stable P. What this means is that most of the phosphorus fertilizer you add to the soil is available to plants for a short period of time, and then it gets locked away in the soil.
