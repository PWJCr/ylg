The main properties of concrete blocks are compression and tensile strength, absorption, dimensional accuracy, density, and shrinkage (Parsekian et al., 2012 ). In relation to density, units with a density of less than 1700 kg/m 3 are usually classified as lightweight, while normal weight blocks are those with a density greater than 2000 kg/m 3
