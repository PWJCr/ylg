## Minerals and Rocks [UPSC Geography Notes] - BYJUS
Rocks. Rock is the solid mineral material forming the surface of the earth. A rock is composed of one or more minerals. Petrology is the science of rocks which includes the studying of mineral composition, structure, texture, origin, occurrence, alteration and relationship with other rocks. The age of a rock is determined based on carbon-14 dating.

## Hardness: Mineral Properties - The Mineral and Gemstone Kingdom
Hardness is defined by how well a substance will resist scratching by another substance. For example, if mineral A scratches mineral B, and mineral B does not scratch mineral A, then mineral A is harder than mineral B. If mineral A and B both scratch each other, then their hardness is equal. A scale to measure hardness was devised by Austrian
