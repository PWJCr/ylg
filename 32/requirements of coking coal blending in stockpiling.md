## Understanding the impact of coal blending decisions on the prediction 
The accurate prediction of coke quality is important for the selection and valuation of metallurgical coals. Whilst many prediction models exist, they tend to perform poorly for coals beyond which the model was developed. Further, these models general fail to directly account for physical interactions occurring between the blend components, through the assumption that the aggregate properties

## What is coking coal, and where is it used? - Kalkine Media
Metallurgical or coking coal is a primary ingredient in the steel making process. More than two-thirds of global steel is produced in basic oxygen blast furnaces. China is the largest consumer of premium coking coal in the world. Coking coal, generally known as metallurgical coal, is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock. When heated, coking

## Influence of coal fluidity on coal blend and coke quality
Blending of non-coking coals above 20% with the hard coking coals used in this research decreases the blend fluidity and impairs the coke quality. It was seen that the coals lose their fluidity on weathering, and the value becomes less than half after a two months of storage at site. Weathering appears to be more rapid in case of semisoft than

## requirements of king al blending in stockpiling
Coal blending is the process of mixing coals after coal has been mined to achieve quality attributes that are desirable for the coal's intended application (e.g. steam generation, coking). The quality attributes that are most important in blending will differ from one mine site to another and also depend on how the coal seams vary in quality

## Metallurgical Coal - IspatGuru
The conversion from coal to coke occurs in chambers called coke ovens where the volatiles from the coal escape, leaving behind what is referred to as metallurgical coke, which reaches a temperature of around 1,000 deg C to 1200 deg C before being removed from the ovens. The coking cycle is normally dependent on several parameters.

Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.

## Optimal blending strategy for coking coal given geological  - AusIMM
Coking coal is essential to the large-scale production of steel, and the quality of the coking coal significantly contributes to the quality of the produced steel. High quality coking coal has low ash content and a prescribed range of properties including volatile matter content and predicted coke strength. These measures can be improved by processing the raw coal after it has been mined.
