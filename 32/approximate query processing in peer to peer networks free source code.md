## Peer-to-Peer Blockchain Networks: The Rise of P2P Crypto Exchanges
The most popular crypto, Bitcoin, was created to exchange value anonymously and directly among users with a peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction model that eliminates the need for a central intermediary such as a bank or broker. This P2P model laid the foundation for the peer-to-peer blockchain technology which powers Bitcoin — and all

This project explains about finding our sum, average, minimum and maximum count and aggregate in query processing. Peer to peer database has become one of the biggest sources for uploading downloading of images videos and documents by sharing around the net. In this network many systems works together as clients and servers for sharing information.

## Peer to Peer Networks Explained - ComputerNetworkingNotes
A peer-to-peer network is a group of computers or devices that share resources and access shared resources without centralized control. In the group, there is no central authority that defines access rules. All group members have equal rights. A member cannot control another member in any form. How does a peer-to-peer network work?

## Approximate Queries in Peer-to-Peer Systems | SpringerLink
The main challenge in P2P approximate query processing is to select the optimal subset of peers to which the query is forwarded. However, the selection criteria for this subset are completely different for top-k and aggregate queries.While in top-k the goal is to identify the peers holding top objects, approximate aggregate querying algorithms need to find a representative sample of peers.

Therefore, P2P systems are usually applied in areas where approximate query evaluation, i.e., the computation of a nearly complete and correct answer set, is sufficient. As the most frequent application of querying in P2P is search, many of these algorithms fall into the class of top-k query algorithms. Another important case is the

##  Abstract Approximating Aggregation Queries in Peer-to-Peer Networks
A peer-to-peer (P2P) network consists of numerous peer nodes that share data and resources with other peers on an equal basis. Unlike traditional client-server models, no central  Approximate Query Processing: Fortunately, it has been observed that in most typical data analysis and data mining applications, timeliness and interactivity are

Hence, in this paper, we assume the ﬁrst method is used. 3.2 Super-peer networks A super-peer network operates exactly like a pure P2P network, except that every "node" in the previous description is actually a super-peer, and each super-peer is connected to a set of clients.
