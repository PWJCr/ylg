Flotation. Background. Froth flotation is the follow-on operation, after comminution and classification, in the process of liberating and separating minerals by exploiting the differences in physical properties of the different minerals that make up an ore. Froth flotation is achieved when particles are separated based on their surface potential.

To depict the unknown continuous process of froth flotation, nonparametric estimation provides a credible solution. Commonly used nonparametric estimation techniques include histogram, frequency polygon, shift average histogram, kernel methods [ 15 ], wavelet method, and B-spline expansion models.

Step 3: Set the number of froth image features to be filtered as m. Step 4: Calculate the mutual information of each feature and class from Xh×t and C l h × 1 according to formula 2, and arrange the mutual information in descending order. Step 5: Extract the feature ranking first in information as the first feature of the candidate subset.

## solved problems on performance calculations of froth flotation
A STUDY OF FLOTATION FROTH PHASE BEHAVIOUR. in froth phase bubble size estimates especially close to the froth surface. In a quest to develop novel ways of optimising recovery across the froth phase, a cell was designed that enabled the study of the effects of different air distribution profiles across the pulp-froth interface on flotation performance.
