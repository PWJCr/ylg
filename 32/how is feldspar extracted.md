## Where Is Feldspar Mined - Realonomics
Feldspar is the name of a group of rock-forming minerals which make up as much as 60% of the Earth's crust. Feldspars crystallize from magma in both intrusive and extrusive rocks and they can also occur as compact minerals as veins and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock.

## Example of chemical weatherings.shop
Chemical weathering is also known as biological weathering is the disintegration of soils, minerals, and rocks as a result of direct exposure to atmospheric chemicals or biologically formed chemicals. A good example.With chemical weathering of rock, we see a chemical reaction happening between the minerals found in the rock and rainwater. The most common example of hydrolysis is feldspar

In fact, feldspar is the standard for hardness 6 in the Mohs scale. Feldspars usually are white or nearly white, though they may be clear or light shades of orange or buff. They usually have a glassy luster. Feldspar is called a rock-forming mineral, very common, and usually makes up a large part of the rock.

## The extraction of potassium from K-feldspar ore by low temperature 
The low temperature molten salt method was used to extract potassium from K-feldspar ore, and some related factors including mass ratio between NaNO 3, NaOH, H 2 O and K-feldspar ore, particle size of K-feldspar ore, reaction temperature and time were investigated, respectively. In addition, the optimum condition for this method was determined by a series of condition experiments.

## How feldspar is formed in the earth? - TimesMojo
Jul 7, 2022The mineralogical composition of most feldspars can be expressed in terms of the ternary system Orthoclase (KAlSi3O8), Albite (NaAlSi3O8) and Anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8). Chemically, the feldspars are silicates of aluminium, containing sodium, potassium, iron, calcium, or barium or combinations of these elements. How is feldspar extracted?
