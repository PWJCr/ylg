## Joshua Hendy Stamp Mill - Gold Bug Park
The original Stamp Mill was built around the turn of the century as a community crusher for miners in the area. Rebuilt in the 1930's, the two sets of 4 stamps, when in full operation, could be heard in Placerville just one mile away. The Cornwall Mineral Collection with specimens from all over the world is on display in the building.

Stamp Mill Design. The stamp mill 's battery evolved, no doubt, from the pestle and mortar was not introduced until a comparatively recent date. Beckmann states that mortars, mills, and sieves were used exclusively in Germany throughout the whole of the 15th century, and in France stamps were unknown as late as the year 1579.

A stamp mill is a mechanical device used to separate gold from rocks and ore. It features a number of sizable steel stamps. These stamps are attached to powerful battering arms, which raise and lower the stamps. When the stamps are lowered they come crashing down with a powerful force, crushing the material beneath them.

This is a stamp mill, a 19th-century invention that saved miners from extracting precious minerals by hand, which took far more time and effort.

## Stamp Mill - Digital-Desert
A stamp mill was a mechanical crusher, noisy, heavy and somewhat awkward to operate. The stamps were heavy metal weights that were lifted and dropped on the ore by a crankshaft. The crushed ore would then be further refined, usually by a mercury or cyanide process. The miner would bring the ore to the mill and load it into the ore car.
