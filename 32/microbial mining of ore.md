Microbial mining facilities resemble laboratories more than foundries, segmented into clean rooms to limit contamination of the rare minerals, and are usually placed near the ore sites - in some cases in underground facilities near canyons or boreholes.

## Biomining: metal recovery from ores with microorganisms
Biomining is an increasingly applied biotechnological procedure for processing of ores in the mining industry (biohydrometallurgy). Nowadays the production of copper from low-grade ores is the most important industrial application and a significant part of world copper production already originates from heap or dump/stockpile bioleaching.

The difference is that rather than using heat to then extract the metals from these rocks, biomining uses microbes. Up to now, biomining has mainly been used to extract copper and gold from rocks where they're present at low concentrations (around 0.5% or less), known as low-grade ores.

On the other hand, microbial metabolism can also contribute to the formation of certain ore deposits over geological time. Microbes occur in high numbers in soil, and due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, it is the negative net charge of the cell envelope that makes these organisms prone to accumulate metal cations from the environment

Bacteria perform the key reaction of regenerating the major ore oxidizer which in most cases is ferric iron as well as further ore oxidation. The reaction is performed at the bacterial cell membrane. In the process, free electrons are generated and used for the reduction of oxygen to water which produces energy in the bacterial cell.

Bioleaching involves the utilization of microorganisms and their metabolic products to dissolve metals from low-grade ores. This mechanism directly depends upon some of the factors that are the size of the microbial population, its metal tolerance capacity and adaptation towards the mining environment.

Biohydrometallurgy is used to perform processes involving metals, for example, microbial mining, oil recovery, bioleaching, water-treatment and others. Both of these species are used in the biohydrometallurgy industry in methods called bioleaching and biomining, whereby metals are extracted from their ores through bacterial oxidation.

## Microbial Mining
Microbial Mining. This website is dedicated to the use of microbes in the mining of metals such as Iron, Copper and Uranium. In short, the main use of microbes in mining is in microbial leaching. This is the process whereby a microbe will reduce or oxidise an insoluble metal into a soluble form, which can then be extracted and used by us.

## What is biomining? | American Geosciences Institute
What is biomining? Biomining is mineral processing with microbes. Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste. Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals. Valuable metals are commonly bound up in solid minerals.

MICROBIAL MINING - Spaceship Earth MICROBIAL MINING The central role of bacteria in the leaching of copper from low-grade ore long went unrecognised, It has been predicted that platinum palladium, gold and thallium can also be transformed in this way The commercial applicability of biomethylation is questionable, however, owing to the

## Bacterial leaching of ores and other materials - Spaceship Earth
The principal bacterium in ore leaching is Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, which is capable of oxidizing ferrous iron as well as sulfur and sulfur compounds. But there are some other bacteria which may also be involved. For example the thermophilic Sulfolobus plays a role in leaching at elevated temperatures. Thiobacillus thiooxidans, which oxidizes
