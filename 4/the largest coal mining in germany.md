## Hambach surface mine
The Tagebau Hambach is a large open-pit coal mine (German: Tagebau) in Niederzier and Elsdorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.It is operated by RWE and used for mining lignite.. The mine is on the site of the ancient Hambach Forest, which was purchased by RWE in 1978.The company then cut most of the forest down and cleared it to mine. Only 10% of the forest area remains.
