Recycled. Crushed concrete is recycled and comes in graded and screened sizes for use as a Hard Fill or Drainage material. It packs well to give a firm base and can be used as an alternative to standard base materials. When graded and screened to fine, crushed concrete works well as leveling under footpaths or concrete driveways.

## How Much Does 1 Cubic Foot of Concrete Weigh? - Weight Calculator
If your square foot of concrete is 6 inches thick, you have to divide 6 (inches) by 12 (1 ft.) to figure out the thickness in feet. 6 / 12 = .5 feet. You know, from the information above, a cubic foot of concrete weighs 150 pounds. Multiply 150 pounds by .5 feet and you get 75 pounds for a square foot of concrete that's 6 inches thick.
