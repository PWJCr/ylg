## The toxic risks of mining rare earths | MalaysiaNow
Rare earth mining and processing is a much more environmentally hazardous process than other mining activities since radioactive waste is formed. It has serious environmental impacts if not properly managed. Low-level radioactive tailings from the presence of thorium and uranium in REEs ores are a potential hazard and improper handling of these

## Rare Earth Element Extraction from Coal Fly Ash
Abstract. Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical and strategic materials in the defense, energy, electronics, and automotive industries. Currently, China produces about 85% of the world supply of rare earth metals and oxides. Approaches for recovering rare-earth species from natural and waste sources is increasingly important to reduce our

All rare-earth ores contain less than 10 percent REO and must be upgraded to about 60 percent in order to be processed further. They are first ground to a powder and then separated from the other materials in the ore body by various standard processes that include magnetic and/or electrostatic separation and flotation.

Since thorium and uranium often occur alongside REEs in nature, tailings from mines tend to be radioactive.
