##  AQP++: Connecting Approximate Query Processing With Aggregate 
trying out all aggregate values as it will increase query processing time significantly. To this end, we propose an efficient aggregate-identification approach. The key idea is to quickly identify a small number of aggregate values whose corresponding queries look similar to the user query and then examine which one is the best only among them.

View Resolution. The SQL Server query processor treats indexed and nonindexed views differently: The rows of an indexed view are stored in the database in the same format as a table. If the Query Optimizer decides to use an indexed view in a query plan, the indexed view is treated the same way as a base table.
