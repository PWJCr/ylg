## The EIA and small scale artisanal miners | The Herald
The mining industry is characterised by large, medium and small scale miners. The Agency uses various tools to achieve sustainable mining, including the Environmental Impact Assessment.

## Formulate environment policy to control small-scale miners
If you go into that legislation, you will see that there is some effort to accommodate artisenary small-scale miners. "In December last year [the] Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe reported that 13,2% tonnes of gold came from small-scale miners and the major big-scale miners only produced 11,6% tonnes.

## Resource policies and small-scale gold mining in Zimbabwe
In Zimbabwe, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) 1 has long been an important economic sector and a contentious arena for policymaking. The sector involves rudimentary forms of mineral extraction, and extensive research has discussed its environmental risks ( Zwane et al., 2006 ). Research has also shown that it provides economic revenues

## The Big Picture on Small Scale Gold Mining in Zimbabwe
A United Nations working paper of 1995, on gold mining in Zimbabwe, estimates over 5000 small scale gold mines. This number has increased significantly since this last study and an estimate of deposits will definitely be in excess of 10 000. The economic stagnation of the last decade has seen development efforts in the area of small scale gold

Even though small scale mining in Zimbabwe is an activity that has been ongoing since the pre-colonial times, it was legalized in the 20th Century.  This has misinformed legislation and extension programs and led to the application of one-size-fits-all policies. However, people working in ASM are far from the same.

## Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) Formalisation Benefits
Sep 16, 2021The majority of artisanal and small-scale mining activities operate informally, which means they take place illegally without the required licences and permits. Despite the existence of legal frameworks for ASM in many countries around the world, the majority of operations remain unregulated and untaxed.

As from 2014, the amount of gold produced annually by small-scale mining increased from 3,938 kg (2014) to 9,680 kg (2016). These figures show the potential of the sector to bring economic growth. The increasing importance of small-scale mining in Zimbabwe is furthermore confirmed by the membership figures of the Zimbabwe Miners Federation.
