Quartzite registers as an 8 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness (1 is softest and 10 the hardest), which is the hardest of any other countertop material, even harder than quartz. To give you some perspective, a fingernail registers at a 2.5 while a diamond lands at a 10. Quartzite has two different looks. One is bolder and dark and the others are

## Schist Vs. Granite: What's the Difference? | Cosmos Surfaces
Granite is extremely heat- and scratch-resistant, since it was is formed under higher temperatures and more pressure than schist. Schist runs slightly more risk of being scratched or etched. Its durability depends on how much mica it contains. New York City's skyscrapers are built into schist bedrock, which goes to show how strong it can be.

Quartzite countertops are a little bit interesting. Some quartzite countertops are considered as soft quartzite. Soft quartzsite would compare with marble in terms of hardness. On the other hand, hard quartzite would be very hard, even harder than granite. It would not be possible to scratch quartzite countertops with knife razor blades, or glass.

Quartzite is a hard, metamorphic rock that used to be pure quartz sandstone. However, after massive amounts of heat and pressure, the pure quartz sandstone turned into quartzite. Quartzite is so strong that one of its most common uses is to be crushed and used as railway ballast. It can also be used in roadway construction.

In fact, quartzite is harder than granite and some types are relatively non-porous, meaning they don't need to be sealed as often as other stone surfaces.

## Which is more heat resistant quartz or granite?
Quartz VS Granite Heat Resistance Typically, granite has higher heat resistance than quartz with the former up to 450 degrees and the latter up to 150 degrees.  Quartz is actually harder than granite and thus, more durable. In fact, quartz is nearly indestructible, and because it isn't porous like granite, it's easy to keep your countertops

## Granite Quartzite Quartz | The Differnce Between Each Material
Oct 11, 2021Quartzite vs Granite. Quartzite is a metamorphic rock formed from sandstone. But granite is an igneous rock, which means that it has crystallized and solidified from lavas molten state. Both granite and Quartzsite are natural stones, but quartzite is a much harder stone. Quartzite is an extremely hard rock that is not water or acid-soluble.
