Most countries require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) before giving the green light to a mining project. EIA processes provide a valuable opportunity for citizens to participate in decisions about mines. The problem is, project proponents often submit long, complex EIA documents that are incomprehensible to lay people.

## The Importance of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
What is an EIA? Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a tool used in most environment based organisations to measure the impact of the environment through the assessment tool. It measures the environmental consequences of a particular plan or policy. This could be important for Urban Planning and Development policies because many of these policies are centered on the environment.

The mining of columbite/tantalite (COLTAN) has a negative effect on the different spheres of the environment notably; hydrosphere, lithosphere, and the atmosphere (Eisler 2004). Just like gold mining, COLTAN extraction involves the breaking of crystallographic bond in the mineral ore to get the products in the pure form.
