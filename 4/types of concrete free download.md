Oct 9, 202115. Vacuum Concrete. In this type, an additional amount of water is added to the concrete mix, and after that, the mixture is poured into the formwork. The excess water is then taken out from the concrete with the help of a vacuum pump without waiting for the concrete sets. It is called vacuum concrete.

## Formwork
History. Some of the earliest examples of concrete slabs were built by Roman engineers. Because concrete is quite strong in resisting compressive loads, but has relatively poor tensile or torsional strength, these early structures consisted of compression-resistant arches, vaults and domes.The most notable concrete structure from this period is the Pantheon in Rome.

The usual density of concrete is around 2400kg/m 3. High-density concrete has a higher density in the range of kg/m 3. The higher density of the concrete is due to the use of the higher density aggregates. These types of concrete are used in the construction of atomic power plants or similar types of structures.

Plain Concrete. Plain concrete will have no reinforcement. The main ingredients are cement, aggregates, and water. The most used mix design is 1: 2: 4, which is a normal mix design. The density of normal concrete ranges between 2200 and 2500 kg / m3. The compressive strength ranges between 200 and 500 kg / cm2.

There are 25 different types of concrete discussed below. 1. Plain Cement Concrete (PCC): Plain Cement Concrete is a basic concrete mix consisting of cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, admixtures (optional), and water. PCC is very strong in compression.

## Cracking of Concrete [ basics, types and causes]
There are different reasons for cracking concrete during it gets hard. Evaporation of moisture from concrete, construction movement, etc affects the concrete to crack. These types of concrete cracks in immature concrete can be discussed under two main categories. Plastic cracking. Constructional movements.
