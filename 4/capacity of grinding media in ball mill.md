May 13, 2022Views: 212 Update Date:May 13, 2022. Current ball milling theory suggests that grinding capacity is influenced by the size of balls charged to the mill. In selecting the appropriate ball charge, the first objective is to determine that ball size which will grind the coarse particles most efficiently. This size should be the largest ball size

It is obvious from the positions of the different sizes ofgrinding media balls within the charge that mill speed is a major factor. At low speed, all the large (white) balls are found at the periphery of the charge. At high speed, they are in the centre. This applies to all types of grinding media, e.g. pebbles, ball or rods.
