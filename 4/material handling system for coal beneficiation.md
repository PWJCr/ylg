2.4.1.1 Wet beneficiation/coal washing. Currently, the wet coal beneficiation process is the predominant method for coal upgrading. The wet beneficiation processes include heavy media separation, cyclone (water only), froth flotation, and spiral separation [23,24]. The use of these technologies depends on the particle size of the feed and the quality of the product required.

2. NECESSITY OF COAL HANDLING SYSTEM A 600MW Power Plant handles about 7200 tons of coals per day. Coal handlings are to be flexible, reliable & capable of handling large quantities in less time than even before. Coal plays a vital role in electricity generation worldwide. Coal-fired power plants currently fuel 41% of global electricity.

Coal ash handling systems are created to safely and efficiently transfer ash from boilers to storage units, where they are then finally disposed of in a responsible manner. There are several types of solids that constitute 'coal ash', and several

##  Coal Beneficiation Technology - 2007 Initiatives, Policies and Practices
Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.

## Coal waste: handling, pollution impacts and utilization
The hard coal beneficiation process in mechanical preparation plants generates coarse, small or fines rejects and coal tailings slurries. The tailings are the finest grain size, with the majority below ~ 0.25 mm, whereby material sized below 0.035 mm makes up to 60% share in the slurry composition.
