## Pyrite Roasting Plant - Metso Outotec
Pyrite roasting, most commonly known as dead roasting process and is mainly used in our zinc and pyrite roasters. When using a dead roasting process for concentrates, the sulfides are completely transformed into oxides. The gas temperature in this type of plant is typically between 800 and 900°C. The hot gas generated in the process is used

Pyrite Ore is an addition from GregTech. It spawns in The Nether in veins approximately the same size as a vein of Coal Ore. Pyrite Ore was described by GregoriusT, the creator of GregTech, as having a "Gaussian distribution probability" meaning that some chunks will have Pyrite Ore everywhere whereas other chunks may have no Pyrite Ore whatsoever for a long distance. .
