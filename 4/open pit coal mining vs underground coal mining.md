## What is Overburden in Mining? - Flyability
Strip mining. Strip mining is a surface mining technique that removes thin layers of overburden in order to reach the mined ore. Overburdens in coal mining—strip mining is commonly used to extract coal near the surface of the earth, and it is a method that is used in the early stages of open-pit mining. Open-pit mining.

## Coal mining
When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using open-cut (also referred to as open-cast, open-pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining causes changes to vegetation, soil, and bedrock, which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology, groundwater levels, and flow paths. [5] Additionally, open-pit produces harmful pollutants depending on the type of mineral being mined, and the type of mining process being used. Contents 1 Extraction 2 Waste 3 Pollutants

I. Surface Mining Methods. Strip Mining :-. Stripping or strip mining is the evacuation of overburden or waste materials from open-pit surface mines. The procedure includes machines, for example, stripping scoops, basin wheel excavators, or drag lines to strip away the stone and reveal the profitable metal that is being mined.

## Open Cut and Underground Mining | iMINCO
Underground Mining is generally used for areas where the mineral seam is too far underground for open cut mining to be of use. A tunnel, called a decline, is created to allow workers and machinery to reach the location of the minerals. Stope mining is used for most hard rock mining of minerals such as copper, silver, lead and zinc.

In 2019, methane emissions from coal mining and abandoned coal mines accounted for about 8% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 1% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (based on global warming potential). Some mines capture and use or sell the coalbed.

## Open-pit vs Underground Mining: What's the difference?
Jul 2, 2021There are two main modes of mining that can be done depending on how shallow or deep the mineral deposits are - it is either via surface or underground, or combination of both. Open-pit mining method is a process of mining near-surface deposits by excavating series of horizontal benches leaving a visible, often circular or elongate "pit".

## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.
