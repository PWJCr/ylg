## Fundamental Research on Ductile Regime Grinding of Brittle Materials 
The bottleneck of the further development of high efficiency precision grinding of brittle materialsis the difficulty of achieving the complete ductile machining of them, which will induce some surfaceand subsurface defects and influence the service performance and reliability of the brittle materialproducts. The traditional method to solve is to use superfine grinding wheel, or to introduce

The results of indentation and scribing tests show that brittle materials can be machined in a ductile manner when penetration depth is less than a critical value. Single point diamond turning of brittle materials, both as an alternative machining technique in its own right and as a model for certain parameters involved in grinding, was performed.

##  Towards High Productivity in Precision Grinding
High energy deep grinding and cut-off operations take place predominantly in the material removal regime by chip formation for ductile materials or by crack formation for brittle materials. It should be emphasized that energy and material removal in grinding is strongly dependent on the nature of the workpiece material.

## A critical energy model for brittle-ductile transition in grinding 
The ability to predict the critical depth for ductile-mode grinding of brittle materials is important to grinding process optimization and quality control. The traditional models for predicting the critical depth are mainly concerned with the material properties without considering the operation parameters.

This process is known as ductile-regime grinding. When brittle materials are ground through a process of plastic deformation, surface finishes similar to those achieved in polishing or lapping are produced. Unlike polishing or lapping, however, grinding is a deterministic process, permitting finely controlled contour accuracy and complex shapes.

## Surface Integrity Control During The Precision Machining Of Brittle 
Basic research into ductile machining of brittle materials has demonstrated that hard materials can be machined, albeit at low tool penetration levels, with ductile type removal mechanisms and that surface and sub-surface damage can be minimised.  Thus, ductile regime grinding conditions can be identified based on the critical chip thickness

## Ductile Grinding of Brittle Materials - ResearchGate
This process is known as ductile-regime grinding. When brittle materials are ground through a process of plastic deformation, surface finishes similar to those achieved in polishing or lapping are
