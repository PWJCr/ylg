## How to Calculate Quantities of Cement, Sand and Aggregate for  - Happho
Considering concrete density = 2400 kg/cum, One bag of cement and other ingredients can produce = 400/2400 = 0.167 Cum of concrete (1:2:4) 01 bag cement yield = 0.167 cum concrete with a proportion of 1:2:4. 01 cum of concrete will require. Cement required = 1/0.167 = 5.98 Bags ~ 6 Bags. Sand required = 115/0.167 = 688 Kgs or 14.98 cft

The actual arithmetic for this is very basic, length X width X depth. The skill that comes with experience is gaining a good eye for averaging uneven surfaces, or more to the point, at the end of a full truck load being able to do a really quick estimate of what is left to be done when re-ordering that extra amount.

In this example, 225 cubic feet (6.37 cubic meters) divided by 27 is equal to 8.33. You have 8.33 cubic yards (6.37 cubic meters) of concrete that will be poured in this example. Finally, convert your cubic yards to cubic meters by multiplying the cubic yards by 0. (the amount of cubic meters in a cubic yard). The total number of
