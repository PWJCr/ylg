The energy required to produce aluminum by the Hall-Heroult process is considerable—about 14,000 kilowatt-hours per ton of aluminum. (A watt equals one joule per second, so a kilowatt-hour equals 3.6 milhon joules.) To put this in perspective, note that a typical household might use about 1000 kilowatt-hours per month.

## The Aluminum Smelting Process Explained | HARBOR
Aluminum production first begins with smelters extracting aluminum from bauxite (sedimentary rock) during a two-step aluminum smelting process. The Bayer process separates alumina from bauxite. Also known as aluminum oxide, alumina then undergoes the Hall-Héroult process, producing pure aluminum. Each step decreases material quantity by half.

The Hall-Heroult process is widely used in the extraction of aluminium. In Hall-Heroults process, pure Al 2 O 3 is mixed with CaF 2 or Na 3 AlF 6. This results in lowering the melting point of the mixture and increases its ability to conduct electricity. A steel vessel with a lining of carbon and graphite rods is used.

## Aluminium smelter plant
This is, in essence, the process that Hall and Héroult in-vented, and which is named after them, but its efficiency has been significantly improved over the years. The electrolysis plant—the aluminum smelter—needs large amounts. "/> skull shaver replacement blades amazon
