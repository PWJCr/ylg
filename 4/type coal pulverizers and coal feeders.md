Depending on speed pulverizers are classified as low-speed, medium-speed, and high-speed mills. Pulverized coal burners may be located on the front or opposed walls or in the corners of the furnace. There are two types of fuel-firing systems: bin system and direct-firing system. Coal feeders are either the volumetric or gravimetric type.
