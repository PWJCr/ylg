## Sprinkling basalt over soil could remove huge amounts of carbon dioxide 
Costs for distributing basalt on a sufficiently large scale would include mining and crushing the rock, transport and distribution. Goll says that a cost of roughly $150 per tonne of removed carbon dioxide is realistic, assuming that basalt is applied to land reasonably close to human infrastructures using aircraft.

## Basalt Rock Dust Increases Carbon Capture Fourfold
There is a convenient caveat though: the aggregate industry already produces powdered rock as a byproduct—there is abundant rock dust already available for the taking. "There's a lot of waste material produced by the aggregate industry and mining industries worldwide, and much of that may be suitable for rock weathering," Kelland says.

Basalt (UK: / ˈ b æ s ɔː l t,-əl t /; US: / b ə ˈ s ɔː l t, ˈ b eɪ s ɔː l t /) is an aphanitic (fine-grained) extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of low-viscosity lava rich in magnesium and iron (mafic lava) exposed at or very near the surface of a rocky planet or moon.More than 90% of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt.
