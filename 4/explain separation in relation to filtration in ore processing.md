An efficient process was proposed for the recovery of iodine via solvent extraction of triiodide (I 3 −) when 21% of I − was oxidized. I 3 − and I − rather than I 2 were confirmed to be extracted into the organic phase containing Alamine336. It was found that the coordination effect was an important contributor in the extraction process.

Filtration is used here to remove solid particles from the liquid. Various filtering agents are normally used like filtering paper or other materials. Sedimentation is a process by which heavier impurities present in liquid normally water settle down at the bottom of the container containing the mixture. The process takes some amount of time.

## Explain magnetic separation process of ores with the help of a neat 
Magnetic separation process of ores: An electromagnetic separator is required. A leather or brass belt moves over two rollers, one of which encloses magnets in it. The powdered ore is dropped over this moving belt at one end. The non magnetic part of the ore is not attracted by the magnet and falls to form a separate heap at a distance.

Mechanism of Filtration. May 7, 2021 by Sujay Mistry. Filtration can be defined as a solid-liquid separation process in which solids are separated from the suspension by passing through a porous medium that accumulates the solids but allows the passage of fluids. The suspension of solid and liquid which is to be filtered is known as slurry.

## Filtration- Definition, Process and Examples of Filtration - VEDANTU
The process of filtration has been known to humans for so many years now. Earlier humans used to dig a hole in the sand on the bank of the river, in such a manner that it has a depth below the level of the river water level, therefore the water enters into the hole and gets filtered by the sand. The modern process of filtration works on the

## The 'seven deadly sins' of filtration and separation systems
Mechanical separation in gas processing, as related to contamination control, is usually undertaken in two of the following areas of the process: Feed and effluent separation, referred to as contamination removal in feed streams and in effluent streams, such as sour gas or wet gas (feed) and treated/sweet gas or dry gas (effluent) (Fig. 1)
