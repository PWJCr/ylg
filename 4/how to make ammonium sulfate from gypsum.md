One is highly soluble, and the other is slightly soluble. While Sulf-N ammonium sulfate is highly soluble, gypsum is only slightly soluble, so sizing becomes critical. Ammonium sulfate is more efficient to spread. Sulf-N ammonium sulfate offers 45 units of total plant food, which makes more efficient use of your fertilizer bins.

## Production of ammonium sulfate fertilizer from FGD-gypsum
The overall goal of this study is to assess the technical and economic feasibilities for producing marketable products including fertilizer-grade ammonium sulfate from gypsum produced as part of lime/limestone flue gas desulfurization (FGD) processes. Millions of tone of FGD-gypsum by-product may be produced in this decade as a result of the
