## Proposed beneficiation of low-grade iron ore evokes mixed reaction from 
India. SHARE. The government's push for beneficiation of 80 percent of low-grade iron ore has evoked mixed responses with some miners saying the move will make iron ore mining an unviable business while others say it will incentivize the sector. The beneficiation process improves the industrial value of low-grade iron ore.

 · Microwave-assisted magnetizing roasts were used to produce an iron ore product from low-grade, goethite-dominant, iron ore plant rejects. Goethite was found to be converted to hematite at temperatures above 370 °C on reduction in a microwave furnace under gas mixtures of 30:70 and 40:60 CO/CO 2.
