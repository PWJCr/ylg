Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site. The blast furnace was where the smelting process was started. In 1646, the original blast furnace roared to life, lit with a 3000 degree fire that was kept burning 24 hours a day for months at a time. The blast furnace is where bog ore was smelted to create cast iron "pig" bars, so named because liquid

## Smelting
Chemical reduction, or smelting, is a form of extractive metallurgy.The main use of smelting is to produce a metal from its ore. This includes iron extraction (for the production of steel) from iron ore, and copper extraction and other base metals from their ores. It makes use of a chemical reducing agent, commonly a fuel that is a source of carbon such as coke, or in earlier times charcoal

Aug 26, 2021Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site. The blast furnace was where the smelting process was started. In 1646, the original blast furnace roared to life, lit with a 3000 degree fire that was kept burning 24 hours a day for months at a time. The blast furnace is where bog ore was smelted to create cast iron "pig" bars, so named because liquid

Huge quantities of air blast in at the bottom of the furnace, and the calcium in the limestone combines with the silicates to form slag.

## basic iron mining process
Iron Ore Smelting Process . 13 03 2010 Iron ore is obtained in the conventional method of open cast or underground mining and conveying the ore to the surface preparation are where it is crushed washed and transported to the smelter Here the ore is put into a blast furnace along with limestone and coke and subjected to hot air blasting and heat

## Extraction of Iron | Metallurgy | Blast Furnace and Reactions - BYJUS
It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs. The extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process, that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag. What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.
