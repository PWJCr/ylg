##  A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONCRETE STRENGTH USING IGNEOUS  - Minna
Fine aggregate is generally natural sand and is graded from par-ticles 5 mm in size down to the finest particles but excluding dust. Coarse aggre-gate is natural gravel or crushed stone usually larger than 5 mm and usually less than 16 mm in ordinary structure [1, 6, 8, 12, 13]. In this research, the emphasis will be on coarse aggregate.

Most marble has a hardness scale of 5. Some people choose to have soapstone installed for their countertops. However, this stone contains talc, which is the softest mineral in nature. For that reason, soapstone is about 3.5 on the Mohs scale, and that rating can change depending on the quarry and quality.

The major sources of coarse aggregate are, dolomite aggregates, natural disintegration of rock and crushed gravel or stone. From the fine aggregate, the surface area of coarse aggregate is less. For the concrete the coarse aggregate use as inert filler material. For concrete, railway track ballast, etc. the coarse aggregates are mainly used.

## What is Coarse Aggregates? Types, Classification, Characteristics 
Oct 2, 2021What is Coarse Aggregate? The Aggregates which will get retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve and will pass through a 3-inch sieve are known as Coarse aggregate. The aggregates used in the production of concrete are inert granular materials such as gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, and recycled concrete.

Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

Coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 0.19 inch, but generally range between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder. Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit, river, lake, or seabed.

Granite Rating. According to the Mohs scale, granite is classified between 6 and 7, giving it a relatively hard ranking. Granite is mostly comprised of feldspar and quartz, with a small amount of other various minerals. An example of how hard granite is would be the fact that a knife blade is unable to scratch a granite counter top surface.

is that specified for the structure. More frequently, however, the coarse aggregates examined are limited to three fractions consisting of gravel or crushed rock in the sizes for standard laboratory acceptance tests-fractions retained on ¾-in., %-in., and No. 4 sieves. Usually, approximately 50 lb coarse aggregate and 2.5 lb fine ag­

## (PDF) Effect of Replacing Natural Coarse Aggregate by Brick Aggregate 
In comparison with the unit weight of 100% stone Test results (Table 2) show that 50% and 100% aggregate concrete the average amount of decrease in unit replacement of stone aggregate with brick aggregate result weights of concretes with 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% the reductions in concrete compressive strength of 9.6% crushed brick as coarse
