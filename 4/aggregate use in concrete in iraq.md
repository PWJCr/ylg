The handling, likewise with numerous regular aggregates, by and large includes pulverizing, evaluating and washing. This eliminates pollutant materials, for example, building up steel, leftovers of formwork, gypsum board, and other unfamiliar materials.

## How Aggregate Cement Ratio Affect Workability of Concrete?
This more cement paste makes the concrete relatively easy to mix, place and compact as it reduces the friction between aggregates and allows its smooth movement. Thus the workability of concrete increases. When the weight of cement is less, i.e. aggregate cement ratio is more, then there will be very less cement paste to coat aggregate surfaces

With Flow Concrete, you can order 3 levels of slump change with different strength ranges. Applications: Flow Concrete makes the concrete physically easier to place without the addition of water. Use Flow Concrete for: High strength concretes. Vertical walls and columns. Structures with heavy steel reinforcement. Floor slabs and exterior flatwork.

Physical Characteristics of Aggregates. 1. Name of Parent Rock & Group Name. All aggregates are produced due to disintegration of rocks. Due to this the property of aggregate is comparable to the property of its parent rock. If we can know the name of parent rock then we can definitely get some facts regarding its strength properties.

Here, two types of aggregates like Fine and Coarse are found. (i) In the Fine Aggregates, the grain-size remains among 4.75 mm and 0.15 mm. These move through from sieve containing mesh size of 4.75 mm and are preserved on a sieve of 0.15 mesh size. Sand belongs to the most commonly accessible natural Fine Aggregate.

## Understanding the Role of Aggregates in Concrete - Bay-Lynx 
Coarse aggregates are defined as any material greater than 4.75 mm. A coarse aggregate is also identified as any aggregate retained in a #4 sieve. Fine aggregates are any material less than 4.75 mm that can pass through a #4 sieve and is retained on a #200 sieve. Why do we use aggregates in concrete? There are many reasons. Perhaps the biggest
