## Grinding Machine And Principles
Jul 03 2021 Principles of Grinding. In all forms of grinding three different interactions occur between the abrasive and the machined material. Cutting occurs where the abrasive grain is sufficiently exposed to penetrate the workpiece material and curl a chip and sufficient clearance exists between the grain bond and workpiece to flush the chip with coolant or throw it away by wheel action.

## Basic Principle of Grinding Machine (1) - Scribd
Basic principle of grinding machine. A.What is grinding machine? A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a machine tool used for grinding, which is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.

## Electrical Discharge Machining : Principle, Working, Equipment's 
Electrical discharge machining process works on the basic principle of spark generation and metal removed by spark erosion. EDM spark erosion is same as electric spark which burn a small hole in a piece of metal through witch it contacts. The spark generated by this process produces heat, which remove metal by erosion and evaporation.
