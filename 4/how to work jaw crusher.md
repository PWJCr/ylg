## How to Change Jaw Liners | Pilot Crushtec
After a new jaw liner installation, rotate the single piece jaw liner when 30% of the tooth profile is worn. Rotate a second time when the tooth profile at the bottom of the jaw liner is completely worn. This procedure will allow for good work hardening of the manganese jaw dies, and maintain the best nip angle for maximum throughput.
