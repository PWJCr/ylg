## Environmental Impacts - Diamond mining in South africa
Mining has had a large impact on environmental sustainability in South Africa and will continue to affect the area into the future. Open-pit mining in mines like Kimberley have created large deep pits which grew wider and filled up with water during rainfall it can increase up to 20 metres at times with heavy rain. An indirect effect of mining is the larger population increases strains in the water supplies and have led to an increase of pollution in rivers.
