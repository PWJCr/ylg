## Diatomaceous earth - Sedimentary Rocks - Sandatlas
Diatomaceous earth. Diatomaceous earth or diatomite is a light-colored sedimentary rock composed chiefly of siliceous shells (frustules) of diatoms. Diatomaceous earth is a soft and friable rock. It leaves hands dusty if touched and has a fragile feel as if it has a delicate and light-weight internal structure. This feeling is not misleading.
