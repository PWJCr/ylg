Copper is also used for making coins and scientific instruments as well as in decorative applications.

## Copper extraction
The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore minerals from gangue minerals within the rock.

The environmental impacts of Cu mining are closely related to the grade (i.e. the copper concentration) of ore being mined (Norgate and Haque, 2010). In general, mines will target higher grade ores since these represent richer returns. Over time, mines will deplete their higher grade resources and move to lower grade ores, leading to a gradual

## Copper Ore Grade Por Le Instruments
Copper Ore Grade Portable Instruments. Improvement of sulphide-oxide copper ores processing through the use of mixed collector systems has surged. the flotation of a natural porphyry copper ore with bornite and malachite was investigated via fundamental work with pure minerals and a bench-scale testing regime. the 4.3.3.4 copper grade

## Copper Ore Grade Portable Instruments
For example, the copper content of a good grade copper ore may be only one quarter of one percent. The gold content of a good grade gold ore may be only a few one-hundredths of a percent. Therefore, the next step in mining is grinding (or milling) the ore and separating the relatively small quantities of metal from the non- metallic material of
