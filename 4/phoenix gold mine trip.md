The mines that pockmark the mountains along the Front Range Mineral Belt are a testimony to the high days of Colorado's gold-mining history, and The Phoenix Gold Mine, dug from the hard rock in the 1930s, is one of the best places to experience it. Phoenix tours, in Idaho Springs, last about an hour or so and take you 750 feet into the earth.
