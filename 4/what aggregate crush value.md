## Aggregate Crushing Value - Significance & Test Procedure
The crushing value of aggregates is measured in the ratio between the crushed aggregates, obtained from the IS sieve 2.36mm and the weight of the dried aggregate sample. At least three samples should be tested from the same batch and average value to get accurate results. The crushing value of aggregate = (W2/W1) x 100. Lab Report
