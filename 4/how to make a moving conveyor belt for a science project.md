To sample the height profile of the items on the belt, the optical device illustrated in Fig. 2 has been used. It is constituted by a two-dimensional source of structured light (a laser beam) and a CCD camera .When no object is present, the intersection between the laser plane and the conveyor belt is a straight line whose position w.r.t. the observed frame is fixed and known (reference line).

So this was the perfect little toy to whip up. Here's how I made this conveyor belt: 1. First, I washed and dried a milk carton. 2. Then, I cut off the top pointy bit and two opposite sides of the milk carton. 3. Then, I ripped out two pairs of holes on opposite sides of the carton. I made them big enough to hold my pens.

## How to make conveyor belts durable enough for mining applications
Steel cord conveyor belts were introduced almost 70 years ago and since then have become the most economical and most environmentally friendly means of transporting bulk material over longer distances. Today, 100km-long multiple flight systems are in operation as well as almost 30km-long single flight systems.

The belt is fitted with appropriate intensity on the frame. Now we connect a motor to one of the rollers. The motor nor moves the roller which inturn moves the belt. This in turn moves the other rollers in order to move objects over it at desired speed. Thus we demonstrate the design and fabrication of a mini conveyer belt system.
