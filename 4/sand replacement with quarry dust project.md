Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.

## details replacement of sand by quary dust
2016/07/28· The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarries. By replacement of quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity.

## properties of quarry dust compared to fine aggregates
Balamurugan et.al.(2013)(8) ascertained that quarry dust can be utilized in concrete mixtures as a good substitute for river sand with higher strength at 50% replacement. Adams et.al.(2013)(9) found that the replacement of 50% fine aggregate by M-Sand induced higher compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and durability.
