5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium
