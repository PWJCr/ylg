##  The Prospecting and Evaluation of Alluvial Diamond Deposits - Saimm
Once an alluvial diamond project has been selected, the mineral resource/reserve present on the property has to be determined before it's economic potential can be estimated. Prospecting does not convert a small, low grade deposit into a commercial mine, it simply determines what the resource is and where it lies on the property.

## Kimbundu Mining CC
Alluvial diamond mining occurs in riverbeds and beaches, where thousands of years of erosion and natural forces such as wind, rain, and water currents wash diamonds from their primary deposits in kimberlite pipes to beaches and riverbeds. Miners build walls or divert rivers to expose the diamond-bearing dry river or ocean bed.

## Basic principles of alluvial diamond exploration - ScienceDirect
With a few notable exceptions, alluvial diamond mining is the preserve of the individual digger and the small-scale, if more technically sophisticated miner/ digger -- a private, rather than a corporate operation. Corporate interest in alluvial diamond mining began in New South Wales in the late 19th century and in Namibia a few decades later.
