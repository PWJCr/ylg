## Evaluation and Risk Analysis of Open-Pit Mining Operations
Mining of raw materials is a process that consists of several stages. In open-pit mining, material with high compressive strength is extracted by drilling and blasting and material with low compressive strength is extracted by e. g. a bucket wheel excavator. Most important influencing factors for crusher decision are compressive strength, moisture content, capacity of crusher, abrasiveness

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Surface mining advantages and disadvantages
I. Surface Mining Methods. Strip Mining :-. Stripping or strip mining is the evacuation of overburden or waste materials from open-pit surface mines. The procedure includes machines, for example, stripping scoops, basin wheel excavators, or drag lines to strip away the stone and reveal the profitable metal that is being mined.

## Mining | National Geographic Society
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

## What Are the Benefits of Mining? - Research Summary
A mining operation must either own the land being mined or secure a contract for the "rights" (the legal right) to mine the land. But being free to mine the land is only the beginning. The mining company must invest in equipment and facilities. Beyond that, the mining company must have one or more buyers for its raw materials.

Mining provides raw inputs to an expanding list of "green" technologies. Developing countries' revenue losses from tax base erosion and profit shifting and illicit financial flows is USD 200 billion annually, across all sectors (UNECA, 2017). Mines often pollute underground and surface water systems and create negative impacts downstream.
