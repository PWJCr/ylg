## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.

This calculator will determine how much port area you need based on the size of the enclosure, how much total input power you will be using, and the tuning frequency.  area you will need to keep port velocity under about 30 meter per second for slot ports and 32 meters per second for aero (or other round) ports. Port velocities above these.
