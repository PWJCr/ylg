## Why is granite not used for road construction? - World Of Synonym
Jun 15, 2022What type of stone is used in road construction? The two main types of natural aggregate are crushed rock (limestone, igneous rock, and sandstone) and sand and gravel. Aggregates are used in concrete, mortar, roadstone or asphalt (drainage courses), or for constructional fill and railway ballast. Which rock is used to pave roads?
