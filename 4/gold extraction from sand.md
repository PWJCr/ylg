## Gold Extraction Process Methods Summary - JXSC Machine
Description of Gold Extraction Process technology, 4 ways of extract gold from its ore, gravity separation, flotation process, cyanidation process( CIP, CIL) and amalgamation.  It is widely used abroad to select sand gold mines. Cone concentrator. Cone concentrators evolved from the principle of a narrow chute (also known as a fan chute

## How To Extract Gold From Sand? - Mining-pedia
Differ from rock gold separation method, it is relatively simple to extract gold from sand. There are many simple methods, like panning, using a rocker box, using a sluice box, amalgamation and etc.. But it is proved that gravity separation method is the most effective and economic method through lots of practice.
