Impact Crushers are available in stationary, track, and portable configurations meeting any demand for any of these industries. Although Impact Crushers generally have a higher operating cost than other crushers, they tend to produce a more uniform particle shape (cubical) which is desirable and produce more fines for hot asphalt producers.

Material enters an Impact Crushers' crushing chamber along a controlled feed angle. A spinning rotor assembly strikes the stone with a predetermined force sufficient to cause fragmentation. The trajectory of the material is then controlled to divert the flow back into the rotor circle, where the hammers (blowbars) continue to impact the material.

Impact crushers are named after the method they use in reducing larger blocks of rocks to smaller grain sizes. As the name suggests, an impact crusher accelerates the feed material to high speed and then flings the fast-moving rocks against the walls of the crushing chamber and each other. This collision, impact, causes the stones to break down .

A good rule of thumb for reducing material size is 3:1 from when it strikes the primary apron to its eventual exit, and the primary and secondary aprons should work together to facilitate this gradual reduction. In practice, it is best to work backwards from the desired output size using the 3:1 rule of thumb.
