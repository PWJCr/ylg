## Magnetic Separation Process - Hongxing Mining Machinery
The magnetic selection process is a wet and dry joint dressing process for the separation of magnetite, mainly used for three-level magnetic separating processing. The magnetic field strength of the magnetic separation is 400~1200GS while the magnetic drum rotating speed is about 60~320 rings/minute.

## An Overview of Basic Gold Separation Methods
Panning. Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Electromagnetic manipulation of charged and of
Electromagnetic manipulation of charged and of neutral particles generally requires very different field geometries due to the orthogonality between charge monopoles and neutral dipoles. This has led to a natural separation between the fields of charged- and neutral-particle optics. We show however that the additional rotational degree of freedom of neutral dipoles can lead to an equivalence.
