Fineness Modulus of grading of aggregate. The fineness modulus is an empirical factor computed from the sieve analysis.

## Classification & Test on Aggregate - Civil Engineering Notes
Fine Aggregate : All the aggregates which pass through the 4.75 mm sieve are called as fine aggregates. On the basis of particle size distribution, the fine aggregates are classified into four zones - (Zone I to Zone IV.)  Bulking Test : The increase in volume of sand due to the presence of free moisture in it is called as bulking of sand.

## Bulking of Sand & Why is it Important in Construction? - Happho
If the sand is wet, particles get a covering of water, which due to surface tension, keeps them separately and thus causes an increase in volume known as " Bulking ". Bulking increases gradually with moisture content and the increase in volume may reach ~35% by volume at 5% - 6% moisture content by weight. It then decreases down to zero

## Fine Aggregates: Types, Properties & Uses in construction
Qualities of fine aggregates: Fine aggregate should be clean i.e. it should be free from lumps, organic material, etc. It should be strong and durable. It should not react with cement after mixing. Also, it should have a tough floor. It should not absorb greater than 5% of water. These types of aggregates should not be soft and porous.

## Bulking Of Fine Aggregate and Laboratory test - Civil Knowledges
Bulking of Fine Aggregate. The volume increase of fine Aggregate due to the presence of moisture content is known as bulking. This is due to the fact that moisture causes a film of water around sand particles which results in the increase of volume of sand, for moisture content of about 5 to 8%, this increase of volume may be a much as 20 to 40%, depending upon the grading of sand.

Classification of aggregates based on: Grain Size. If you separate aggregates by size, there are two overriding categories: The size of fine aggregates is defined as 4.75mm or smaller. That is, aggregates which can be passed through a number 4 sieve, with a mesh size of 4.75mm. Fine aggregates include things such as sand, silt and clay.

## Fine Aggregate Angularity - Pavement Interactive
The fine aggregate angularity (FAA) test (Figure 1) is an indirect method of assessing the angularity of fine aggregate. Fine aggregate angularity is important because an excess of rounded fine aggregate (often in the form of natural sand) can lead to HMA rutting. Figure 1: Fine aggregate angularity test. The FAA test estimates fine aggregate

A fully saturated fine aggregate does not show any bulking. The rate of bulking is inversely proportional to the size of the aggregates. Hence, fine aggregates bulk more compared to coarse aggregates.

Fine aggregate is basically any normal sand particle that comes from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates comprise regular sand or any squashed stone particles that are 1/4″ or smaller. This item is frequently alluded to as 1/4″ short as it alludes to the size, or evaluation, of this specific aggregate. Fine Aggregate.

## Bulk density and bulking of fine and coarse aggregate - SlideShare
For ordinary sands the bulking usually varies between 15 to 30 percent. Fine sand bulks more and the maximum bulking is obtained at a higher water content than the coarse sand. In case of coarse aggregates the increase in volume is negligible. Extremely fine sand and particularly the manufactured fine aggregate bulks as about 40 percent.
