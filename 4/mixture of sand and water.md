## How can you separate a mixture of sand and water?
Here, a sieve is used to separate a mixture of sand and gravel. What happens when you mix sand with water? When we mix sand and water, no reaction takes place. The sand simply settles down at the bottom of the water container. This is because sand is heavier than water and hence cannot float in water. In comparison, if we mix something like

Another method to separate components of a mixture is based on melting point. The melting point of salt is 1474°F (801°C), while that of sand is 3110°F (1710°C). Salt becomes molten at a lower temperature than sand. To separate the components, a mixture of salt and sand is heated above 801°C, yet below 1710°C.

Hence, the mixture of sand and water can be separated by two methods: Combination of sedimentation and decantation: As sand is insoluble and heavier than water, it settles down at the bottom of the container containing the mixture. This process is called sedimentation. After the process of sedimentation is complete, water is slowly transferred

Following are the correct option to the above question - (i) Sediment - in the mixture of sand and water, the sand settles to the bottom of the liquid, and it does not dissolve.The matter that settles as sediment is sand. (ii) Filtration - It is the process of separating the suspended solid matter from a liquid.In a mixture of mud and water, mud can be separated from water by filtration.
