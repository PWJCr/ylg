## plaster
Plaster of Paris is a type of building material based on calcium sulfate hemihydrate. It is created by heating gypsum to about 150 °C. Plaster is used as a building material similar to mortar or cement. Like those materials plaster starts as a dry powder that is mixed with water to form a paste, which then hardens. WORKSHOPS.

Plaster of Paris is manufactured by the action of heat on gypsum. Gypsum is another hydrated salt. The chemical formula of Gypsum is calcium sulphate dihydrate, CaSO4 ⋅2 H2O. Upon heating, some of the water escapes in the process of evaporation, giving POP. Thus, it can be prepared industrially in this manner. It exists in a dry powder form.

## Plaster of Paris - Advantages and Disadvantages of Gypsum Plaster
Regular exposure to moisture or water reduces the strength of the plaster. Gypsum plaster has a shelf life of only 3 to 4 months, but if stored carefully it can be extended up to 6 months. Even in a dry place, this plaster cannot be stored for more than 3 months, else it starts deteriorating. Difference Between Gypsum and Plaster of Paris

Plaster of Paris is manufactured by heating gypsum at 373 - 393 K or 150° C/300° F. CaSO4·2H2O + heat → CaSO4·0.5H2O + 1.5H2O (discharged as steam) On heating gypsum at 373 - 393 K, it loses water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate hemihydrate. This product is known as the plaster of Paris.

## Science Experiments With Plaster of Paris | eHow UK
by Ben Sellars / in Hobbies. Plaster of Paris, also known as gesso, is a mixture of gypsum that, when mixed with water, forms a mouldable clay that dries and hardens without the need for a kiln or oven. It has been a staple of elementary school science projects for years because the characteristics of plaster of Paris make it so easy to work with.
