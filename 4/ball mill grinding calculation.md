For ball milling, you can assume a porosity of about 0.35 to 0.40 (the volume of space between the balls) and you can normally assume the pulp surface level is equal to the ball charge surface level. So do a crash-stop and measure the volumetric filling of the charge, then multiply that volume by 0.35 or 0.40.
