Thermal power plants generate around 80 per cent of the electricity produced in the world 3, by converting heat into power in the form of electricity. Most of them heat water to transform it into steam, which spins the turbines that produce electricity. After passing through the turbine, the steam is cooled down and condensed to start the cycle

## What Is a Thermal Power Plant? Operation and Types
A thermal power plant is an electric plant that converts thermal energy into electrical energy. The difference between one type of plant and another is the way the heat is obtained. The heat sources of a thermal power plant are: Fossil fuels ( coal, diesel and natural gas) Nuclear reactions of uranium atoms. Biomass. Solar energy.

## How does a Thermal power plant work - Lesics
Thermal power plants use water as working fluid. Nuclear and coal based power plants fall under this category. The way energy from fuel gets transformed into electricity forms the working of a power plant. In a thermal power plant a steam turbine is rotated with help of high pressure and high temperature steam and this rotation is transferred

## Thermal Power Generation Plant or Thermal Power Station
The theory of thermal power stations or the working of the thermal power stations is very simple. A power generation plant mainly consists of alternator runs with help of a steam turbine. The steam is obtained from high-pressure boilers. Generally in India, bituminous coal, brown coal, and peat are used as fuel for the boiler.The bituminous coal is used as boiler fuel has volatile matter from
