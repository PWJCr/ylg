dynamic modelling and simulation of ball mills. The dynamic simulation results show that the behaviour of the system would be to have growth in adopters that follows a classic s-curve shape. The increase in adopters is very slow initially, then exponential growth for a period, followed ultimately by saturation.

## Dynamic modeling and simulation of a relief valve - Asok Ray, 1978
Abstract. A nonlinear dynamic model of a relief valve is for mulated in state-space form from fundamental princi ples of rigid-body motion and fluid dynamics. Model parameters are calculated from steady-state character istics and the physical dimensions of the valve. The transient response of the nonlinear model (as well as system eigenvalues
