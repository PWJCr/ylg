## Coal-to-gas plant conversion is gathering pace in the US and Canada
As coal-plant operators seek ways to repurpose their old units to avoid them becoming stranded assets, conversion to natural gas has been a widely-adopted strategy in the US and is also favoured by Alberta, Canada-based TransAlta. Between 2011 and 2019, 121 coal-fired units in the US were repurposed to burn other types of fuel, according to the

Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

Jun 01, 2020· Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

The broken coal falls into a pan line, which leads to a conveyor belt and then to the processing plant. Longwall machines now extract more than 55 percent of all West Virginia coal mined underground. Continuous miners are used primarily in room-and-pillar mines and operate similarly to longwall machines.
