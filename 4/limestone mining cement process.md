## how is the limestone process
Calcination. In limestone calcination, a decomposition process that occurs at 900 to 1050ºC, the chemical reaction is CaCO 3 (s) → CaO (s) + CO 2 (g). Today, this reaction largely occurs in a cement kiln.. The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction is approximated as ΔG° r ≈ 177,100 − 158 T (J/mol).

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
