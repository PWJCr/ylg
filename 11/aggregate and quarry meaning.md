## Quarry | National Geographic Society
Jul 6, 2022Sand, gravel or crushed rock excavated from a quarry is called aggregate. Aggregate is used in construction to create stable foundations for things like roads and railroad tracks. Aggregate is also used to make concrete and asphalt. For this reason, asphalt and concrete plants are often built next to quarries.

## Classification of Aggregates Based on Size and Shape -Coarse and Fine
The rounded aggregates are completely shaped by attrition and available in the form of seashore gravel. Rounded aggregates result in the minimum percentage of voids (32 - 33%) hence gives more workability.  Or in the other, when the least dimension of aggregate is less than the 60% of its mean dimension then it is said to be flaky aggregate.

Aggregates are the major ingredients of concrete. Aggregates are derived from rocks. They are broadly divided into two categories i.e. fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Their properties are depended on the mineralogical composition of the rock. Crushed rocks are used as coarse aggregates are river sand is used as fine aggregates.

( Quarry) Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction - GreenFacts
Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

## What Are Aggregates and How Are They Used? - CEMEX USA
Concrete aggregates are composed of geological materials such as gravel, sand and crushed rock. The size of the particles determines whether it is a coarse aggregate (e.g. gravel) or a fine aggregate (e.g. sand). The resulting concrete can be used in its natural state or crushed, according to its use and application.

Quarry. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine in which dimension stone, rock, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, gravel, or slate is excavated from the ground. The operation of quarries is regulated in some jurisdictions to reduce their environmental impact.The word quarry can also include the underground quarrying for stone, such as Bath stone.
