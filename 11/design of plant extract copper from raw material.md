## Phytochemicals: Extraction, Isolation, and Identification of Bioactive 
Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has been used in diverse applications of food-processing technology to extract bioactive compounds from plant materials . Ultrasound, with levels greater than 20 kHz, is used to disrupt plant cell walls, which helps improve the solvent's ability to penetrate the cells and obtain a higher extraction yield.

## Copper - Essential Chemical Industry
Data from: 1 International Copper Study Group, 2015. 2 U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries, 2016. Manufacture of copper. About 80% of the world's primary copper comes from ores in which copper is present as a sulfide mineral, for example, chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) (the most abundant copper ore), bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4) and chalcocite (Cu 2 S). These ores contain typically only about

## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

Plant extract refers to a product that is formed through an extraction and separation process where plants are used as raw materials. Generally the original components of the plants are not changed. In some cases, excipients are also used to make the powder or granular products have features like good fluidity and resistance to moisture absorption.

Copper Concentrate. Copper concentrate is the fundamental raw material used to make copper. In nature copper can be found in a great many minerals, at a percentage ranging between approximately 0.5% and 10%. Once these minerals have been mined, various processes are applied to increase the copper concentration to 20 to 35%.

## Extraction plants | SCHRADER
SCHRADER extraction plants. Extraction is any separation process in which a (solid, liquid or gaseous) solvent is used to extract one or more components from a natural raw material, the extraction material. The extracted substance is called an extract. The substances to be extracted dissolve better in the solvent than in the raw material.

## Copper Production: How Is Copper Made? - ThoughtCo
The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
