Dec 6, 2021Concrete grinders typically remove about 1/16 of an inch of the floor or pavement in a single pass. Take this into account when determining the depth of the initial trim. Create a smooth surface by slightly sloping the concrete back from the lip or edge of the crack. Use a dry hand grinder to smooth off the surface.
