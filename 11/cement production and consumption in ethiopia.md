## Ethiopia's cement industry is booming - Cement Lime Gypsum - ZKG
In Ethiopia the available capacities are far too small to meet the increasing demand for cement. More than 1/3 of the present cement consumption is therefore imported, which has driven cement prices up to very high levels. Against this background, a gigantic expansion of cement production capacity is currently taking place.

## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cement production process is one of the most energy-consuming processes and has a strong environmental impact. The main impact on the energy consumption of cement production is the burning process of cement clinker in a rotary kiln, and the energy costs associated with burning cement clinker constitute 50-75% of cement production costs.
