## Uses of coal - Mining for schools
The steel industry is the second largest user of coal. Coal and iron are essential raw materials used in the production of steel, which is one the most useful metals products known to man. Coking coal is used as a fuel to melt iron in furnaces to produce cast iron which in turn is further refined to produce steel.

Room and Pillar mining This method of mining is used to recover bedded deposits that are horizontal or nearly horizontal when the orebody and the surrounding rock are reasonably competent. Parallel openings are mined in the ore, i.e., rooms, and blocks of ore, i.e., pillars, are left in place to support the overlying strata.

The concept of the reserve base is to define a quantity of in-place coal, any part of which is or may become economic depending upon the method of mining and the economic assumptions that are or will be used. An additional purpose is to aid in long-range public and commercial planning by identifying coal suitable for economic recovery.

## Classification Of Coal Mining Method And Uses
Coal mining Wikipedia. Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.

Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production. In continuous mining, a machine

Coal mining traditionally took place underground, with men and equipment following seams of coal deep within mountains. Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

## Types of Mining Methods | Cummins Inc.
Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

## Commonly used mining techniques to extract coal - ICSC
Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two main methods of mining coal. Depth, density, and thickness of the coal seam are the factors that are taken into account while selecting the mining method for coal extraction. However, many coals extracted by using these two methods need washing in a coal preparation plant.
