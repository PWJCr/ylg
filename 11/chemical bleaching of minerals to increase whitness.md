## chemical bleaching of minerals to increase whiteness
In general, the use of whiteness indices in the dental field is limited to only a few examples in the literature. Garcia et al. (1993) reported that the WIC was the best index for describing the whiteness of a group of 20 samples of porcelain teeth in vitro.More recently, Guan et al. (2005) used the WIC to determine the increase of whiteness of extracted teeth following a bleaching procedure

Improved methods for bleaching kaolin clay and other minerals are provided. More particularly, methods of the present invention employ a hydrosulfite or bisulfite material and a second reducing agent, preferably a reducing agent that contains a Group III element, such as a borohydride, to increase the brightness of kaolin clay and other minerals and reduce color present therein.

## Measuring Whiteness - Clean India Journal
The 'Whiteness Index' is an umber, computed by an instrument that indicates the level of whiteness. In the testpiece report, the higher the Whiteness Index value, the greater the whiteness of the measured testpiece. If the preferred white fabric has a high reflectance, then the ideal Whiteness Index for textile materials should approach 100.

## Catalytic bleach: Most valuable applications for smart oxidation 
Interacting with H 2 O 2 in a catalytic cycle any bleach catalyst gives rise to a specific ensemble of active intermediates. Their steady state concentrations are available for chemical reactions. Depending on the process conditions and on the test material used in practice, this chemistry transforms into specific levels of bleaching, damage, disproportionation and catalyst decay.
