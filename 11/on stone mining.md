Crushed stone is typically quarried—that is, mined using benching methods (carrying out work from a ledge in a mine or quarry) and explosives, as opposed to the mechanical digging used for extracting sand and gravel

## Quarry
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.). There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types (mines and caves). For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries. In the 18th century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was mastered.

## Shiny stone minning? - On the Hunt - Reborn Evolved
Or if you'd like, I can give you one. Gen 4+ Evolution stones (the "rare" ones) aren't naturally in the mining pool, however there's a neat little mod I quite like that adds them to the pool (and a couple other things) I don't remember if you can mine a shiny stone, but iirc, there's a shiny stone at Azurine Island.

## How to Farm Stone in Valheim - ProGameTalk
Mining Stone with Pickaxe. When it comes to a later time in Valheim, you will be needing a lot of stone for building as well as other needs in the game. You get your first pickaxe after defeating Eikthyr, the first boss who drops Hard Antler when it is killed, which you will use to make an Antler Pickaxe.
