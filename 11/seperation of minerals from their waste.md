## Separation and Characterization of Minerals from Centrifuged Waste 
Minerals were removed from waste latex sludge after immersing in acid solution such as sulfuric and formic acid. The sulfate group of sulfuric acid reacted with magnesium of waste latex sludge formed precipitated Boussingaultite. The phosphate was removed after immersing waste latex sludge in formic acid and purifying with sodium hydroxide.

## SEPARATION OF MINERALS BY SPECIFIC GRAVITY - Justia
A centrifuge for separating minerals by specific gravity is disclosed. The centrifuge rotates to circulate slurry across a collection region and to subject slurry in the collection region to centripetal forces that facilitate stratification within the collection region by the specific gravity of the constituent minerals of the slurry.

In the process of waste separation, a distinction is made between two methods: The originator sorting by himself. The subsequent sorting in waste sorting plants, the so-called splitting. The latest developments are taking into account the later disposal of a product already during its manufacturing and use. This should make waste separation easier.

Waste separation means that different types of waste are collected and recycled separately. In Germany, waste separation starts with the consumer, i.e. households must sort their waste and put it in separate bins and containers.

## How important is waste separation? - Across The Green
Waste separation (or waste segregation / trash sorting) is the process of sorting your trash into different bins depending on the materials or elements that it is composed of. This allows these items of trash to be more easily recycled as the trash facilities have separate streams of trash. It gives them much less sorting to do themselves.

Gas bubbles are generated in a liquid and become attached to solid particles or immiscible liquid droplets, causing the particles or droplets to rise to the surface. This is used to separate mixtures of solid-solid particles and liquid
