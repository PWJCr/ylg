## How Rare-Earth Mining Has Devastated China's Environment
About 35% of the world's reserves of rare-earth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

## Rare Earth Elements - Rare Element Resources
The amount of rare earths used in high tech equipment is nominal but almost always critical to the unit's performance. For example, an iPhone uses eight rare earths - for everything from its colored screen, to its speakers, to the miniaturization of the phone's circuitry.  By 2000, China accounted for more than 95% of world rare earth

## Myanmar's environment hit by rare earth mining boom
Between 2016 and 2019, Myanmar's rare earth production increased by 88 times compared with the period. It's also about the same time that global demand for rare earth elements increased as a result of the growing consumption of high-tech devices. Harmful activities. The number of rare earth mining sites in Kachin State is unknown.
