A field survey found the gravel content to be in the range of 10 to 20%. As-dug samples had excessively high sulfate content, which could not be removed with conventional aggregate operations. However, intensive treatment in a local sand-processing plant using multi-stage crushing, screening and washing reduced the sulfate to acceptable levels.
