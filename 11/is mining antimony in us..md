## What is antimony poisoning? Explained by FAQ Blog
Why is antimony bad for you? Chronic exposure to antimony in the air at levels of 9 mg/m 3 may exacerbate irritation of the eyes, skin, and lungs.Long-term inhalation of antimony can potentiate pneumoconiosis, altered electrocardiograms, stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach ulcers, results which were confirmed in laboratory animals.

No marketable antimony has been mined in the United States since 2001, when the Sunshine Silver Mine in Idaho, which produced antimony as a byproduct, closed. What ore does antimony come from? Stibnite (Sb2S3) is the predominant ore mineral of antimony. The most important use of antimony metal is as a hardener in lead for storage batteries.
