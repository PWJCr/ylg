The bulk density of ROBO sand or crusher dust is 1768 kg/m3. The specific gravity and fineness modulus of ROBO sand are 2.66 and 2.88 respectively. Fineness modulus is an empirical factor obtained by adding the cumulative percentages of aggregate retained on each of the standard sieves ranging from 80 mm to 150 micron and dividing this sum by 100.

Fineness Modulus of Fine Aggregate: The sand fineness module (fine aggregate) is an index number describing the mean size of sand particles. By doing sieve analysis with normal sieves, it is measured.. The accumulated percentage kept on each sieve is applied and the sum of the fine aggregate is subdivided by 100.

Fineness modulus of aggregate is an index number which gives an idea about the finance of aggregate and is an approximate proportion of the average size of particle in the aggregate. It is found out by sieve analysis test of standard size in the laboratory. The thumb rule is lower the fineness modulus, particles are

## How to Blend Aggregate Using Fineness Modulus Value?
Step-4 (Calculating Ratio of Fine Aggregate to Coarse Aggregate) Let " x " is the percentage of fine aggregate to be combined with coarse aggregate. x can be calculated using the formula given below. x = [ (F2-F)/ (F-F1)]100. Where, F1 = Fineness modulus value of fine aggregate. F2 = Fineness modulus value of coarse aggregate.

To avoid this ambiguity fineness modulus could be used as a yard stick to indicate the fineness of sand. The following limits may be taken as guidance: Fine sand : F.M. : 2.2 - 2.6 . Medium sand : F.M. : 2.6 - 2.9 . Coarse sand : F.M. : 2.9 - 3.2 . Sand having a fineness modulus more than 3.2 will be unsuitable for making satisfactory concrete

## what is fineness modulus in riversand - Welcome to Tables & Thyme
Jul 31, 2016· Fineness modulus of sand (fine aggregate) is an index number which represents the mean size of the particles in sand. It is calculated by performing sieve analysis with standard sieves. The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fineness modulus.

## Fineness Modulus of Fine Aggregate (Sand)
Fineness Modulus of Fine Aggregate (Sand) Sand (fine aggregate) has a fineness modulus, which is an index number that gauges the sand's average particle size. Sieve analysis with conventional sieves is used to compute it. The fineness modulus is calculated by adding and subtracting the cumulative percentage retained on each filter by 100.
