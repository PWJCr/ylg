The procedure of copper processing involves mining and transporting. The open-pit mining is adapted for mining copper regarding which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. The machinery is then used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break

The process of mining copper begins with drilling and blasting. Large drilling rigs bore a carefully designed pattern of holes approximately 12 inches in diameter and 60 feet deep into the rock. The holes are filled with an explosive compound of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate which blasts thousands of tons of ore in a single detonation.

Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.

Typical Copper Extraction Process. The process of extracting copper for its ore is quite complex and varied. It largely depends on the type of ore in question, particularly whether it is a sulfide or oxide type. Copper mining has typically been performed through open-pit mining, where stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the ground

## Toxic chemicals from theiddelburgelectro
Toxic chemicals from the mining process have been known to leak into water supplies. Researchers in Nevada found that fish as far as 150 miles downstream were being impacted by mining operations.Lithium-ion batteries also need a lot of cobalt - typically around 14kg per car battery.Extracting this is dirty and dangerous.
