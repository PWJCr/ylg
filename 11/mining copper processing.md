Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.

Typical Copper Extraction Process. The process of extracting copper for its ore is quite complex and varied. It largely depends on the type of ore in question, particularly whether it is a sulfide or oxide type. Copper mining has typically been performed through open-pit mining, where stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the ground

## Toxic chemicals from theiddelburgelectro
Toxic chemicals from the mining process have been known to leak into water supplies. Researchers in Nevada found that fish as far as 150 miles downstream were being impacted by mining operations.Lithium-ion batteries also need a lot of cobalt - typically around 14kg per car battery.Extracting this is dirty and dangerous.
