11.17.1 Process Description1-5 Lime is the high-temperature product of the calcination of limestone. Although limestone deposits are found in every state, only a small portion is pure enough for industrial lime manufacturing. To be classified as limestone, the rock must contain at least 50 percent calcium carbonate.
