## What is a Gyratory Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
The crushing process of the gyratory crusher is to rotate one circle along the annular crushing cavity, and it can work continuously at 360°, while the main shaft of the jaw crusher rotates only 135° once, so the production efficiency of the gyratory crusher is that of a jaw crusher. 2-3 times as high as the production efficiency.

Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1]. The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.
