## Lime (material)
Lime is a calcium-containing inorganic material composed primarily of oxides, and hydroxide, usually calcium oxide and/or calcium hydroxide.It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coal-seam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The International Mineralogical Association recognizes lime as a mineral with the chemical formula of CaO.
