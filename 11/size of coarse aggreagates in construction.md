## What Is Grading Of Aggregates? And Its Limits [Civil Planets]
The grading of aggregates is the determination of the aggregate size used for construction works. The coarse aggregate is graded as per its size (10mm, 12mm & 20mm). The selection of the right coarse aggregate size depends on the specific construction activity. You will understand how grading of aggregates influences the bondage in concrete

Coarse aggregates are classified into two main groups: (i) single-size aggregate and (ii) graded aggregate. Single-size aggregate is based on a nominal size specification. It contains about 85 to 100 percent of the material which passes through that specified size of the sieve and zero to 25% of which is retained in the next lower sieve.

But in the real scenarios it considers above 9.5 mm diameter stones as the coarse aggregates. From 9.5 mm - 40 mm range will be considered as coarse aggrigates. But typically, 20 mm size coarse

## Types of Construction Aggregates - Veedu Building Materials
Coarse Aggregates. Coarse aggregates are the ones that are retained (cannot pass) on the IS Sieve of 4.75mm. Crushed stone and gravel are the most common coarse aggregates. Their large size doesn't allow them to pass through the given sieve. The maximum size of aggregate used in cement concrete is 40 mm. Types of Aggregates According to Weight

## Fine Aggregates: Types, Properties & Uses in construction
Introduction to fine aggregates: The maximum size used is 80 mm and the range of 80 mm to 4.75 mn is known as coarse aggregate and 4.75 to 150 µm is called fine aggregate. Size 4.75 mm is common for both fine and coarse fractions. Qualities of fine aggregates:
