## gold leaching with thiourea
The objective of this work was to recover gold and silver from the printed circuit board (PCB) of discarded mobile phones by thiourea leaching. Effects of thiourea concentration, leaching temperature, leaching time, and ferric ion (Fe3+) concentration on the recovery of gold and silver were investigated. The PCB was pretreated physically to

Other chemicals that are commonly used for leaching gold are bromine, chlorine, and thiourea. Although the most common method is cyanide leaching, other methods have shown promise. However, it is important to understand that cyanide is toxic to human beings. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the optimum leaching rate for an individual ore.

The only smell present during the leach time is ammonia. PH has every thing to do with using thiosulfate. If you let your leach run too long,and let the PH drop too much during run time,it will then pull in some iron. Run time,PH,and temperature are the keys to using thiosulfate. P.S. All of my observations are with sodium thiosulfate.

## Mineral Processing And Extractive Metallurgy : 100 Years Of Innovation 
The move away from the dominating, century old batchwise drilling, blasting, mucking concept will however be slow. Initially new concepts such as in-situ leaching, continuous mining and blast-free mining will be introduced in special applications. Hardrock cutting, for example, will most likely first get introduced in narrow vein and reef mining.

## thiourea gold leaching | Provide water treatment agents for industries 
SO2 Leaching Followed by Thiourea Leaching. Thiourea is a reducing and complexing agent and can be used for the processing of gold and silver. The redox potential of gold(I) and silver(I) thiourea complexes in acidic thiourea solutions are 0.380 and 0.023 V (vs SHE), respectively (Kazakov et al., 1983; Lodeishchikov et al., 1975).

## Sustainable Design of Molybdenum Disulfide Nanocomposites for Silver 
Low capital cost, high selectivity, no dust generation and reduced environmental effect advocate the versatility of hydrometallurgical route. Silver leaching from WPCBs through cyanide, thiourea and thiosulfate have been investigated. Cementation, ion exchange, solvent extn., and membrane processes employed for recovery of silver have been studied.
