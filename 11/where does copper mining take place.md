## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.  where final refining takes place. A dc electric current, passed through the cells, dissolves the anodes and deposits the copper on cathodes. The final product of the refining process is electrolytic tough pitch (ETP) copper normally containing between 99.94 and 99.96% Cu.

The Upper Peninsula supplied 90% of America's copper by the 1860s. It was the largest supplier of iron ore by the 1890s, and production continued to a peak in the 1920s, but sharply declined shortly afterward. The last copper mine closed in 1995, although the majority of mines had closed decades before. Some iron mining continues near Marquette.
