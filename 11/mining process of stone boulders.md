Open cast mining. Open cast mining is one of the methods of gemstones mining, where the overlying minerals or rocks are removed to reach the gemstones-bearing rocks. The gemstones-bearing rocks are then washed by jets of water under high pressure to obtain the gems. These are then sent to treatment plants for further processing.

## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages 
Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.

A smart way to get stone, especially early on in the game would be to destroy prefab stone buildings, which you can find mostly in the Black Forest. You can use a weapon such as a Flint Axe to start hitting the walls of the structure until all sides have been destroyed, causing the rest of the building to collapse and drop a lot of stone.

Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock, which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.

## How They Do It: Gemstone Mining - Gemporia
Open cast or 'open pit' mining is a technique of extracting gemstones, such as Diamond and metal ores, like gold and silver, from the surface of the earth by digging downwards, eventually creating a pit. This method is used when the gems lie near the surface of the ground and the earth covering the gemstones is relatively thin.
