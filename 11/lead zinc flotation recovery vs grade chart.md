This depends on the grade of the ores: gold grades are around 1 g gold/tonne of ore, copper ore contain around 1% metal, while iron ore with a grade of around 60%. The production of ores containing PGMs is however much smaller, only 100 Mt. Most ores are produced in open pit operations, as much as 85% varying from metal to metal.

## Sulphidization flotation for recovery of lead and zinc from oxide 
A new flowsheet was developed to recover the valuable minerals from oxide or oxide-sulfide ores of lead and zinc. The flowsheet consisted of flotation of sulfide minerals, desliming and sulphidization-flotation of oxide minerals. The corresponding reagent system and techniques to the flowsheet were investigated. Batch and continuous tests show that the dosage of sodium sulfide, temperature
