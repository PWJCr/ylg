This depends on the grade of the ores: gold grades are around 1 g gold/tonne of ore, copper ore contain around 1% metal, while iron ore with a grade of around 60%. The production of ores containing PGMs is however much smaller, only 100 Mt. Most ores are produced in open pit operations, as much as 85% varying from metal to metal.

## Sulphidization flotation for recovery of lead and zinc from oxide 
A new flowsheet was developed to recover the valuable minerals from oxide or oxide-sulfide ores of lead and zinc. The flowsheet consisted of flotation of sulfide minerals, desliming and sulphidization-flotation of oxide minerals. The corresponding reagent system and techniques to the flowsheet were investigated. Batch and continuous tests show that the dosage of sodium sulfide, temperature

##  Experiment study on recovering lead and zinc from a flotation tailings 
the content of lead and zinc sulfide minerals such as galena, sphalerite were small. The flotation tailings was used as the research object and the indexes of the lead grade of lead concentrate for 48.30%,the recovery for 65.41%,and the zinc grade of Zinc concentrate for 42.24%,the recovery for 84.69%,. total recovery of silver in lead and zinc
