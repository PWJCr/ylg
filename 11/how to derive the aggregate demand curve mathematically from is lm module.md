## Aggregate Demand Curve - Finance Train
The aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between the quantity of real output demanded (Same as real income) and the price levels. In the above graph we can observe this relationship, i.e., when price levels go up, the real income goes down. The prices and income levels are inversely proportional to each other, as shown in the graph below:

Watch on. Also known as the Hicks-Hansen model, the IS-LM curve is a macroeconomic tool used to show how interest rates and real economic output relate. IS refers to Investment-Saving while LM refers to Liquidity preference-Money supply. These curves are used to model the general equilibrium and have been given two equivalent interpretations.

It is the demand curve that shows relationship between price of a good and its quantity demanded. In this section we are going to derive the consumer's demand curve from the price consumption curve . Figure.1 shows derivation of the consumer's demand curve from the price consumption curve where good X is a normal good.

## The IS-LM Curve Model (Explained With Diagram) - Your Article Library
The IS-LM curve model emphasises the interaction between the goods and money markets. The goods market is in equilibrium when aggregate demand is equal to income. The aggregate demand is determined by consumption demand and investment demand. In the Keynesian model of goods mar­ket equilibrium we also now introduce the rate of interest as an
