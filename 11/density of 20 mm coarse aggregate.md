## Bulk Density of Aggregates - Civil Snapshot
January 3, 2021 - by Kathir - Leave a Comment. Bulk density of aggregates is the mass of aggregates required to fill the container of a unit volume after aggregates are batched based on volume. It depends on the packing of aggregate i.e. Either loosely packed aggregates or well dense compacted aggregates. In case, if the specific gravity of a
