## Process Of Iron Mining
The Mining Process. The Mining Process. 1. Mining open pit and underground. To define the ore from the waste rock samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.

Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.

## The Production Of Iron Ore: What Makes Our Main Product - Vale
Ore is a mineral or a collection of minerals (rock) which may be operated economically. Iron ore, for example, Vale's main product occurs as oxides, carbonates, sulfides and silicates, being the most abundant oxides and greater commercial interest. Our ore, for example, consists mainly of oxides hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4).

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black
