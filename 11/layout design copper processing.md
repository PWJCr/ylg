The usual practice of the manufacturer is to follow the center line of the frame in the illuminating file provided by the designer. In the actual board, the center line of the design is 264.62. 127.66mm, the border line width is 0.64mm. According to this design, the original intention is to take the inner edge of the border line as the shape.

L Shaped Factory Layout. An L shaped layout example is used when the layout flows around a corner. It is usually the least space efficient as it is hard to make use of the space on the inside of the L. Also, material handling pathways to the outside of the "L" are often long. Product also starts and finishes in opposite corners of the layout.

Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.

## Copper Countertops (Types & Design Styles) - Designing Idea
As for the mixture, mix epoxy and the copper metallic powder at a 1:1 ratio. After it's thoroughly mixed, pour the epoxy into the center of the countertop and spread it using a trowel. Then, randomly chop the surface with a paintbrush to remove the trowel lines and give the surface a natural look.

## A layout dependent full-chip copper electroplating topography model 
Our proposed ECP model can be used to model systematic variations caused by an ECP process or by a chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. The potential applications of this model include: layout design evaluation for catastrophic failure prevention; yield aware design (design for manufacturability), and variation- aware timing analysis.
