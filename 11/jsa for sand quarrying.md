The quarrying industry is a noisy industry. The QPA3 states that typical noise levels could be between 89-108dB (A) for a primary crusher and dB (A) for hand drills. The principle health effect of being exposed to high levels of noise in the long term is noise-induced hearing loss.

## What is Quarrying?
Quarrying is the process of removing rock, sand, gravel or other minerals from the ground in order to use them to produce materials for construction or other uses. So, a quarry is any such working on the surface of the earth where minerals are extracted. Quarries are also known by other names around the world: 'surface mine', 'pit', 'open

## Former Quarries of Tampines - Roots
Although sand quarrying started in Tampines as early as 1912, the quarry boom began in the 1960s when the construction of public housing estates and other urban redevelopment resulted in a high demand for sand. At its peak, there were more than 20 sand quarries in Tampines and the industry attracted traditional farmers and fishermen of the area

## Quarrying | MCR Safety
A quarry is a place, most often recognized as a dip pit, from which stone and rock is excavated from the ground. Today's quarrying industry produces crushed stone, granite, marble, sand, and gravel. Most of these minerals are close to the surface, making surface mining or opening pit mining the primary form of mining.
