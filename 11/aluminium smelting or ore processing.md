## How Aluminum Works | HowStuffWorks
The primary s­ource of aluminum is an ore known as bauxite. An ore is any naturally occurring solid m­aterial from which a metal or valuable mineral can be obtained. In this case, the solid material is a mixture of hydrated aluminum oxide and hydrated iron oxide.  The alumin­um smelting process developed by Hall resulted in large amounts

## Hall-Héroult process
The Hall-Héroult process is the major industrial process for smelting aluminium.It involves dissolving aluminium oxide (alumina) (obtained most often from bauxite, aluminium's chief ore, through the Bayer process) in molten cryolite, and electrolyzing the molten salt bath, typically in a purpose-built cell. The Hall-Héroult process applied at industrial scale happens at °C and

About 2 kg of alumina are consumed for each kilogram of aluminum produced. The smelting process is continuous. Additional alumina is added to the bath periodically to replace that consumed by reduction. Heat generated by the electric current maintains the bath in a molten condition so that fresh alumina dissolves.

Aluminum production first begins with smelters extracting aluminum from bauxite (sedimentary rock) during a two-step aluminum smelting process. The Bayer process separates alumina from bauxite. Also known as aluminum oxide, alumina then undergoes the Hall-Héroult process, producing pure aluminum. Each step decreases material quantity by half.

The smelting of aluminum begins with the extraction of bauxite ore by a form of open cast mining. The bauxite is washed and screened before being converted to alumina, a white powdery element from which the aluminum is produced. Aluminum smelting is carried out in a Hall Heroult reduction cell, which is lined with carbon. A mix of alumina and cryolite is fed into the cell and carbon blocks

Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form. Its compounds, however, are an important constituent of virtually all common rocks.

During the electrolysis, the liquid aluminum is deposited at the cathode. At the same time, the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon to produce carbon dioxide. A typical aluminum smelter requires a great deal of electricity to function properly. This means that smelters are often built near to or in conjunction with large power stations.

## Aluminium smelting process pdf
Molten aluminium is extracted from the alumina through an electrolytic process called smelting, which breaks the strong chemical bond of the aluminium and oxygen atoms using a powerful electric current. Once the liquid metal is collected it is transferred in the casthouse, where it is purified, alloyed to specification and then cast into ingots.
