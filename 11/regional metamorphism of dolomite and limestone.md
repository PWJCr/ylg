## Why Are Some Metamorphic Rocks Foliated While Others Are Not?
What determines whether a metamorphic rock is foliated or non-foliated? Metamorphic rocks have been modified by heat pressure and chemical processes usually while buried deep below Earth's surface. Exposure to these extreme conditions has altered the mineralogy texture and chemical composition of the rocks.

The metamorphism of siliceous dolomitic limestone is considered with the aid of a composition tetrahedron which suggests that the changes may be referred to thirteen steps or grades of increasing decarbonation, taking place at successively higher temperatures at any given pressure.

What Factors Cause Metamorphism? There are 3 main agents that cause metamorphism. Factors that cause an increase in Temperature Pressure and Chemical changes are the three agents that we are going to study. Temperature increases can be caused by layers of sediments being buried deeper and deeper under the surface of the Earth.

Metamorphism of Dolomites and Limestones . There are two main types of carbonate rocks, dolomites and limestones. The first is modally dominated by dolomite (CaMg(CO 3) 2), the second by calcite (CaCO 3) and there is a complete gradation between the pure dolomite and limestone "end members" indicated by the rock names, calcitic dolomite, dolomitic limestone, magnesian limestone.

when does a sedimentary rock become a metamorphic rock. Sedimentary rocks are made up of small pieces of rock that were once underwater. Over time these rocks are crushed and squeezed together which causes the small pieces to change shape.

Score: 4.4/5 (33 votes) . Regional metamorphism is metamorphism that occurs over broad areas of the crust.Most regionally metamorphosed rocks occur in areas that have undergone deformation during an orogenic event resulting in mountain belts that have since been eroded to expose the metamorphic rocks.

## Is marble metamorphosed limestone? Explained by FAQ Blog
What type of metamorphism is marble? This is contact metamorphism. Some examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks are marble, quartzite, and hornfels. Marble is metamorphosed limestone. When it forms, the calcite crystals tend to grow larger, and any sedimentary textures and fossils that might have been present are destroyed.

## regional metamorphism of dolomite and line
1) Regional Metamorphism is the result of high pressures and elevated temperatures associated with deep burial in an orogenic belt. Platy minerals (micas) and elongate minerals (hornblende) recrystallize and/or rotate into a new orientation perpendicular to the applied stress, while other minerals recrystallize into new crystals which are

## Shallow burial alteration of dolomite and limestone clumped isotope 
Carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry is a promising method for paleoclimate reconstructions and understanding diagenetic processes, although clumped isotope compositions (measured as Δ 47 values) can be altered by recrystallization and thermal resetting. Several studies have investigated the effects of deep burial and exhumation on Δ 47 values; we present Δ 47 values of samples from
