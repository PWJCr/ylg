## Our Energy Sources, Advanced Coal Technologies — The National Academies
Advanced Coal Technologies. In the nationwide effort to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants when fossil fuels are burned, coal is a prime target: It accounts for more than one-quarter of America's CO2 emissions. And although coal's share of all fuels used for electrical generation is expected to decline during the next 25 years, the U.S. Energy Information

## Drilling Methods Used in Coal Mines | Geology for Investors
Coring ( diamond drilling) is another way of collecting information about a potential coal resource. The drill rig is equipped with a hollow tube, and as the drill pushes the rods into the ground, a cylindrical piece of the rock is pushed into the hollow tube. These samples are usually the length of a drill rod, which is 6 meters.
