## The hammer that mills: Boosting livestock production through local feed 
With these hammer mills, farmers in the area are able to have their grains like pigeon peas, cow peas, sorghum and maize, milled into livestock feed. CLIM2 trained the farmer groups also in feed making "The hammer mills are helping farmers use available grains turn into low-cost nutrition rich feed, "says Lackson Kampunga.

## Hammer Mill Crusher & Grinder - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The hammer mill is the best known and by far the most widely used crushing device employing the impact principle of breaking and grinding stone. Thus far we have described machines which do a portion of their work by impact, but the only machine described in which this action plays an important role was the sledging roll type and particularly the Edison roll crusher and in these machines

Roller mills are the most common mill used in the U.S. Corn Belt. They are more energy efficient and generally result in a more uniform particle size than hammer mills. However, hammer mills are still in use, and preferred when the feed will be pelleted or a need for greater flexibility in particle size.

Hammer Mill Crusher. The Dixie (Non-Clog) Hammer Mill Crusher differs from all other hammermills in that its breaker plate, instead of being stationary, is a continuously moving belt of manganese steel links. The feed thrown into the hopper is carried by a positive mechanical feed to the hammer-points and then on through the grates.

Particle size range for a hammermill screen size can be adjusted through manipulation of the hammer tip speed, which is made possible by the use of motor variable frequency drives. The hammermill is a cost-effective method of reducing particle sizes of grains for feeding. There are several facets which can affect the final particle size

In fact, the hammer mill should be equipped with a heavy particle trap and a magnet to separate the feed from stones, glass, and pieces of metal that might enter the machine causing damage, a risk of explosion and poor pellet quality. Ventilation air required for the milling process is sucked in by an opening in the rear of the heavy particle trap.

Hammer milling is a high energy process of reducing particle size (comminution) by impact with rapidly moving hammers. The material is fed into the mill's chamber through a feed chute, typically by gravity, where it is struck by rapidly rotating hammers that strike particles repeatedly until the particles are reduced to a size that can pass
