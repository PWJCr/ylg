## Density of Construction Materials in kg/m3 and lb/ft3
Density is also called as unit weight of substance. It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density, it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.

quarry dust-red earth mixes was found as 40% and 60% respectively. The opti-mum values of the mixes are defined with respect to the dry density of quarry dust alone. It is observed that there was an increase of 11.61% in the dry density when 40% of the red earth is replaced with quarry dust. The optimum value of. Read More
