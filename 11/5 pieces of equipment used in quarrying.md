## Process: Quarrying · Art of Making
Quarrying in the Roman period was undertaken with the quarry pick and wedge. Channels would be cut along the sides and rear of the block that was to be removed with the pick and then wedges would be inserted along its bottom and hammered in to split it from the rockface. In later periods explosives were used to dislodge material from the rockface.

## 5 Pieces of Equipment Needed For Aggregate Crushing
Aggregates are made up of several different kinds of materials. The word "aggregate" itself means a compilation of different things - in this case, stone, gravel, crushed stone, sand, and slag. Those materials often begin as something bigger-larger stones or layers of compressed sediment - and it takes some work by some heavy duty machines to make them into usable aggregate.
