## Iron ore beneficiation technology and process
Dec 17, 2020Common weakly magnetic iron ore includes siderite, limonite and hematite-siderite. According to the type of mineral and the particle size of the cloth, there are two commonly used methods: (1) Roasting. Roasting magnets are used to sort weakly magnetic iron ore with complex mineral composition and other sorting methods that do not work well.
