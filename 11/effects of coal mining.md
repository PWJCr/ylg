## Coal Power Impacts | Union of Concerned Scientists
Formed deep underground over thousands of years of heat and pressure, coal is a carbon-rich black rock that releases energy when burned. In the United States, roughly 30 percent of all electricity comes from coal: the rest comes from natural gas, nuclear, and renewables like wind and solar. Most US coal comes from either above-ground mines in Wyoming and Montana, or underground mines in

## Impacts of Coal Mining on the Health of Workers
Mining of coal has various effects on the health of the coal miners. The factors that modify these impacts of the coal mining on the health of people are the following: the way it is mined, the emission control in the place and the measures used to control its impact. (Selvey, L., 2014).

## Social and Economic Benefits of Coal Mining - AfriCoal
The presence of coal mining supports economies in many ways. At the most basic level coal mining provides employment for local communities. In South Africa the coal industry totals more than 12% of the mining workforce - more than 65,000 workers - and it is estimated that more than US$1 billion in wages are paid to its workforce each year.

## Environmental consequences of mountaintop coal mining
Mountaintop mining is a widespread practice in eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. It involves removing forests, clearing topsoil and using explosives to expose buried coal. Excess rock is pushed into nearby valleys, disturbing habitats and blocking streams. Regulations require minimizing environmental impacts on land and
