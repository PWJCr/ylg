Hematite is the main mineral form of iron oxide, and iron is mainly smelted by hematite. I t is a sub-mineral widely distributed in various rocks and is usually produced together with magnetite. In addition to iron smelting, powdered hematite is also used as a red pigment and abrasive. The application of hematite usually requires beneficiation.

Feb 3, 2022front It is said that hematite accounts for a considerable proportion in China's iron ore resources. Compared with magnetite, most hematite has fine embedded particle size, large mud content and great difficulty in beneficiation. Therefore, since the sixth five year plan, China has regarded hematite as a national scientific research project and achieved fruitful results.

However, hematite ores may contain higher concentrations of contaminant elements (such as phosphorus, alumina and silica) and may therefore need to be blended prior to smelting.

## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Any microbially induced beneficiation process will prove to be cost-effective, energy-efficient, and environment-friendly compared to chemical alternatives which use toxic chemicals.  The level of comminution required for the low-grade hematite ore is similar to high-grade ores to deliver the same products, lumps and fines. In most cases
