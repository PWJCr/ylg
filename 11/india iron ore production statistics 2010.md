## Iron & Steel Industry in India - India Brand Equity Foundation
In FY22, the production of crude steel and finished steel stood at 133.596 MT and 120.01 MT, respectively. The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective labour. Consequently, the steel sector has been a major contributor to India's manufacturing output.

## Production of Iron ore in India, 2017 - 2025 (Million Tonnes)
India's iron ore production fell in 2020 in respect to 2019, mainly due to the decline in output from the country's largest-producing state of Odisha. The delay in the auctioning of mines in Odisha - which were to be held in March 2019 - due to the lack of clarity on the maximum lease area, impacted production in the state.
