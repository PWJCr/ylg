## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.

## Jaw Crusher VS Cone Crusher | Which Is The Better Crusher
The gyratory body of cone crusher is higher, twice or three times of jaw crusher, and the workshop cost is larger. The weight of cone crusher is larger than that of jaw crusher with the same output by 1-2 times, so the equipment cost is higher. The installation and maintenance of cone crusher is more complicated than jaw crusher.

## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
The price of the cone crusher is much more expensive and its capacity is stronger than a jaw crusher of the same gape. For example, if your material is 250mm, you want better processing capacity with an adequate budget, you'd better choose the cone crusher because its capacity can be 85-170 t/h, while jaw crusher only 16-105 t/h.

Features & Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.

## Basic Information of Jaw Crusher Specification
Jaw crusher capacity is contingent upon the power of the engine as it is the engine that provides the energy requisite for continued crushing. Maximum feeding size is also directly related to engine power specifications, because a crusher's ability to reduce material is contingent upon the power an engine is capable of producing. Third,the

For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## What is the crushing capacity of the cone crusher?
Jun 4, 2021The crushing capacity of a cone crusher refers to the amount of materials crushed per unit time. The length of the hammer head of the cone crusher protruding from the hammer plate is limited. Therefore, no matter how big the block is, it will always be knocked off according to the extended length, and then further crushed. Therefore, the feed size of the cone crusher can reach 2/3 of the

Jaw crushers are generally used as the first break in the production line, and its output will directly affect the output of the entire production line. 1. Strictly control the feed size. The design size of the jaw crusher's feed port has such a formula: feed port size= (1.1~1.25)maximum particle size of raw materials.
