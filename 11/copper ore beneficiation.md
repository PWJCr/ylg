Mar 10, 2021 The copper ore beneficiation process generally adopts a relatively simple process. After one stage grinding, the fineness -200 mesh accounts for about 50% to 70%, 1 roughing, 2 to 3 selections, and 1 to 2 sweeping. If the copper mineral impregnation particle size is relatively fine, the stage grinding process can be considered.

During beneficiation of clay-containing copper-gold ores, the use of small quantities of Na 2 S (at natural pH) improves both copper and gold metallurgy considerably. In the presence of soluble cations (e.g. Fe, Cu), additions of small quantities of organic acid (e.g. oxalic, tartaric) improve gold recovery in the copper concentrate.
