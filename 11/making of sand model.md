The sand mold is in an uncured state as the metal is being poured. Sand casting using green sand is quick and inexpensive since the sand can be reused. The downside is that the sand is a soft mold and can collapse or shift during casting, leaving an unusable cast. However, the process is reliable enough that it has survived for centuries and is

## Basing: When do I glue the model onto the base? - Forum - DakkaDakka
it depends on what your using. With sand you want to glue the model to the base first, then apply the sand. paint the model and the sand, and then apply the turf last. Gluing a model to sand is just asking for it all to fall off. usually you will only applt the model last if you are attaching to something, like a large rock, or some cork.
