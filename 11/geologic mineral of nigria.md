## r/geology - If ice is a mineral, is a glacier with rocks in it 
Glacier ice is a type of rock, according to the USGS. Glacier ice, like limestone (for example), is a type of rock. Glacier ice is actually a mono-mineralic rock (a rock made of only one mineral, like limestone which is composed of the mineral calcite). The mineral ice is the crystalline form of water (H2O).

## Cassiterite - Mineral Properties - Used as an Ore of Tin - Geology
Cassiterite is a tin oxide mineral with a chemical composition of SnO 2. It is the most important source of tin, and most of the world's supply of tin is obtained by mining cassiterite. Small amounts of primary cassiterite are found in igneous and metamorphic rocks throughout the world. It is also a residual mineral found in soils and sediments.

## Nuhu George Obaje. Geology and Mineral Resources of Nigeria
Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2009. - 218 p. Foreword Books on Geology and Mineral Resources of Nigeria are very few and mostly not accessible in Libraries and Bookshops in Nigeria. This book by Professor Nuhu Obaje is therefore a welcome development and could not have come but at a better time with the renewed interest and activities in the Geology and Mineral Resources of Nigeria.
