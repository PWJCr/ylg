## Camshaft grinding: Advanced technological innovation through 
Cam grinding is one of the more complex grinding operations. This is because of the cam's geometry. In standard, cylindrical grinding, such as for producing shafts and pistons, as the workpiece rotates and the wheel plunges in, the material-removal rate and wheel-workpiece contact area are both constant.

## How the hell does regrinding a cam work? | The H.A.M.B.
A cam is a bump on a circle. When the lifter is riding on the circle, it's at zero lift. as the cam rotates, the lifter sides over the bump. Regrinding a cam is making the circle smaller, in order to make the bump bigger so it can be reshaped. David. Hemi Joel and silent rick like this.

A camshaft is a rod that mechanically turns to convert rotary motion into reciprocating motion. In the case of an engine, a camshaft is a part of the engine that regulates the opening and closing of an IC engine's inlet and exhaust valves. A camshaft has more than one cam. It has many radial cams, which displace the inlet or outlet valve.
