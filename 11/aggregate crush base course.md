## Aggregate Base Courses - Buildipedia
In order to adequately serve their function, aggregate base course soils must contain enough larger soil particles (gravel, crushed stone) to provide strength and permeability, yet enough fine particles (clay, silt) or additives (chemical stabilizers) to maintain their cohesion and structure under loads. For this reason, aggregate base courses are usually a graded mixture of soil elements
