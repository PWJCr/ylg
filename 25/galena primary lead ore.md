## Lead glance
Galena, also called lead glance, is the natural mineral form of lead(II) sulfide (PbS). It is the most important ore of lead and an important source of silver. Galena is one of the most abundant and widely distributed sulfide minerals. It crystallizes in the cubic crystal system often showing octahedral forms.

## Extracting Lead Materials from Ore
Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. Of the more than 60 minerals that contain lead, only 3 galena, cerussite and anglesite are commercially viable. Usually, lead is found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by product of these other more valuable metals.

By 1845, Galena was producing nearly 27,000 tons of lead ore and Jo Daviess County was producing 80 percent of the lead in the United States. Illinois and Wisconsin lead mining peaked in the 1840s, and a substantial percent of the mining population was lured away by the excitement of the "Gold Rush" in California.

Galena is the most abundant lead mineral, has been mined for millennia, and remains our major source of that metal. It is a metallic, lead-gray mineral with cubic cleavage and a distinctly high density that makes galena samples feel much 'heavier' than expected for their size.

## Lead
The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), which is mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead minerals are related to galena in some way; boulangerite, Pb 5 Sb 4 S 11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite, PbSO 4, is a product of galena oxidation; and cerussite or white lead ore, PbCO 3, is a decomposition product of galena.
