## Cohesion coefficient of structural concrete made with recycled concrete 
The cohesion coefficient of structural concrete made with recycled concrete coarse aggregate (RCA) was evaluated independently for the first time, through push-off tests having no clamping force across the shear plane, and compared with the cohesion coefficient of structural concrete made with natural coarse aggregate (NCA).

## Performance of Recycled Fine-Aggregate Concrete Using Novel Mix 
In this context, use of recycled fine aggregate (RFA) from construction and demolition (C&D) waste can be considered as an effective elucidation. Conventional mix proportioning of RFA in concrete can not be used. To address this issue, a novel mix-proportioning method is developed using particle packing density and minimum paste theory.

However, using a recycled aggregate of more than 65% can impact the mix's durability significantly, reducing its physical properties tenfold. The optimum amount blended in with the concrete should be 35%. Some experiments have shown that the recycled aggregate is durable, no doubt, but not as sturdy as natural coarse aggregate.
