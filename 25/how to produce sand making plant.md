Can you put sand in the bottom of a potted plant? To start, make sure your plant's pot has drainage holes at the bottom to filter out excess water. Next, add sand, gravel, or both into your soil's top and bottom layer. Doing this will help drain extra water from your plant and keep its roots from getting too wet.
