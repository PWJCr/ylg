## What Is the Reduction Ratio of the Crusher?
Surface reduction ratio: the ratio of the width of the crusher inlet to the width of the outlet. Calculation formula: I=0.85B/S (inlet width/discharge width referred to here) 0.85 is the width coefficient of the crusher to accommodate the material. The value S of the width of the discharge port: the coarse crusher is different from the medium

Inversely, at a given reduction ratio, effective streamlining could increase the capacity by 30%. The typical reduction ratio is bound to be between 6 and 8 and is similar that of jaw equipment. Applying the crushing force by rolling the nut breaks flats and gives a product that is more "cubic" than the jaw crusher. - Contact

Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.
