## Paper: Geomechanics of Australian open cut coal mining
Geology of coals, coal measures rocks, overburdens, and groundwater are described. Mining operations for the black coal and brown coal industries are very different. Both are outlined to provide a context for geotechnical characterisation that covers rank, coal materials, virgin and pre-existing stress states, and data gathering.

Most iron ore mining operations use the 'open pit' method, where miners drill into the rock and blast the ore-bearing material loose with explosives. Huge excavators are then used to gather the loosened ore.
