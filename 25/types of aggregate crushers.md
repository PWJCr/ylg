## Selecting the right crusher : Pit & Quarry
Each type of crusher is different and used to achieve a certain end result. Similarly, a certain output is expected at the end of each crushing stage for the next phase of the process. Aggregate producers who pair the correct crusher to the correct stage will be the most efficient and, in turn, the most profitable. Crushing stages

2RC is a well-graded aggregate that may be coated with earthen fines such as clay, silt, dirt and loam, as well as stone dust. It has no structural coefficient and does not drain. The pieces have an angular shape from the crushing process. Its best quality is that it is highly compactable, which allows the stones to interlock for strength.
