## How is pure copper extracted once Phytomining has occurred?
The copper produced by this process is 99.99% pure copper. Why is Phytomining used to remove copper compounds from the land? (c) A new way to extract the copper from land that contains low percentages of copper sulfide is phytomining. Phytomining uses plants. Plants are grown on this land and absorb copper compounds through their roots.

## Phytomining - Trends in Plant Science
Phytomining is the production of a `crop' of a metal by growing high-biomass plants that accumulate high metal concentrations. Some of these plants are natural hyperaccumulators, and in others the property can be induced. Pioneering experiments in this field might lead to a `green' alternative to existing, environmentally destructive, opencast mining practices.

## "Phytomining" Trees Can Extract Metal from the Earth - Freethink
What is it: Phytomining is a method of harvesting metal from the soil by growing plants with a lot of biomass in which to accumulate the ore. These are plants which can take up elements from the soil (at rates) orders of magnitude higher than normal plants. Alan Baker. These "hyperaccumulators" thrive on metals like gold, copper, and zinc.

## Producing Copper Nature's Way: Bioleaching
The "Gall-Copper Process" was recorded as being used during the Song Dynasty (AD). Copper was precipitated from solution by dipping iron into the blue vitriol solution - a process identified as early as 150 BC in China. 6 Therefore, presumably, the recognition of a natural copper leaching process can be identified as early as that date.
