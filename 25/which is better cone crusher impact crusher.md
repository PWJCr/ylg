## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

## Impact Crushers VS Jaw Crushers
Compared with the impact crushers, jaw crushers use the compression force to break down materials. When the material is poured into the chamber and fall though chamber, it will be crushed 2 to 4 times. The reduction ratio of this machine is about 6:1. Besides the higher reduction ratios, the impact crushers is more useful to make a more cubical

## The Differences Between Cone Crusher and Impact Crusher
The impact crusher not only crushes the material, but also has a certain function of shaping the particles. The distribution is more reasonable and the grain shape is beautiful. In contrast, although the crushing effect of the cone crusher is good, it is slightly inferior to the impact crusher in the shaping of the discharged particles. 3.
