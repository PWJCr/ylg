## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high

## Functions Of Grinding Machine
Functions Of Grinding Machine. Grinding machines, like broaching machines, operate over a range of speeds depending on the type of machine being used.These range from approximately 1250 to 2000m min −1, although in high-speed grinding speeds of up to 5400m/min are achievable (Schey, 1987).The two most common grinding applications are cylindrical grinding and surface grinding.
