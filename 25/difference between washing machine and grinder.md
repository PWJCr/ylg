## Buffer or grinder? whats the difference? - The Home Shop Machinist 
The difference between buffers and grinders is fairly simple. The buffer uses a cloth or felt wheel that catches things like rings and watches and tears them off including all the tendons up to the elbow and then whips you with the free end of the tendons. A grinding just blows up and ventilates you with big chunks of ceramic.

## Agitator vs. Impeller Washer: Which Is Better? | Whirlpool
A washing machine with an impeller uses less motion and water than a washer with an agitator. Designed so laundry has more room to move, it drives clothes from the outer rim of the wash basket to the center, using a small amount of water to optimize the friction. This is what helps deliver a gentle, yet thorough clean.

## Differences between the Front Load and Top Load Washing Machine 
They give a more quality clean and tend to be more energy and water efficient than top loaders. In addition, the front load washers pack more wash features to accommodate all fabric types and soil levels. Moreover, front loaders are far more quiet than top loaders thanks to their more advanced motors and suspension systems.

If you are pumping to a septic tank or gravity flow sewer main, then it is much better to use a sewage ejector pump. Septic grinder pumps are also designed to pump surface sewage several thousand feet, which is a much greater distance than a sewage ejector pump can provide. The trade-off is that grinder pumps can only pump small amounts of sewage.

## difference between stone and stone grinderse
The path of the stone is not the only difference between grind honing machines, they also differ in the stiffness of their construction. Honing machines are much morepliant than grinders. The purpose of grinding is to achieve a tight size tolerance. To do this, the grinding wheel must be moved to an exact position relative to the

## Conventional hammermills have rotating blades which grind the
Conventional hammermills have rotating blades which grind the grain in a grinding chamber and pass it through a screen which separates the flour from the larger, unground particles. The operation of a hammermill is shown in Figure 2. As the blades rotate, the flour is carried through the screen by the airflow through the mill.HEUBACH INTERNATIONAL renders a complete solution covering S460
