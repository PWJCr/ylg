4 8.2 Rocks of Western and Nyanza Regions Rocks of western and Nyanza are collectively referred to as Greenstone Granite Belt. The belt is represented by Nyanzian, Kavirondian and Kisii Formations. The Kisii Formation correlates well with Bukoban rocks of Tanzania and Karoo rocks of South Africa. The belt is an extension of the Tanzanian craton into Kenya and to a smaller extent into south

## Types of Rocks | Earth Science | | Course Hero
Rocks are collections of minerals of various sizes and types. The three main rock types are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Crystallization, erosion and sedimentation, and metamorphism transform one rock type into another or change sediments into rock. The rock cycle describes the transformations of one type of rock to another.

## Metamorphic Rocks - formation, characteristics and examples
Examples of metamorphic rocks are quartzite, slate, marble, gneiss, schist, talc, garnets. It is a rock formed from the metamorphism of sandstone. During the process, the quartz gram is recrystallized, that is, a fusion between the cementing agents. Slate is formed from the metamorphism of shale as a result of intense pressure citing on it.

The S- and C-type asteroid classifications originate from the taxonomy proposed by David Tholen. Meteors are generally considered to be asteroids which enter Earth's atmosphere. Meteorites are meteor remnants which reach the ground. So essentially, carbonaceous chondrite meteor (ite)s start out as C-type asteroids ; they're made of the same stuff.

Metamorphic Rock. Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means "change in form". The original rock (protolith) is subjected to heat and pressure causing profound physical and/or chemical change. The protolith may be a sedimentary rock, an igneous rock or another older

## Characteristics of Metamorphic Rocks (Listed and Explained)
Types of Metamorphic Rocks. We classify metamorphic rocks into two categories: Foliated; Non-foliated; Foliated Metamorphic Rocks. These are formed from straight exposure to heat and pressure. They have the largest metamorphic rock groupings. They have four distinct aligned texture types with a layered or banded appearance.

## Metamorphic Rock Types: Pictures and Descriptions - ThoughtCo
This type of metamorphic was created by regional metamorphism, in which a sedimentary or igneous rock has been deeply buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures. Nearly all traces of the original structures (including fossils) and fabric (such as layering and ripple marks) are wiped out as the minerals migrate and recrystallize.

Types of Metamorphic Rocks. A metamorphic rock used to be some other type of rock, but it was changed inside the Earth to become a new type of rock. The word metamorphism comes from ancient Greek words for "change" (meta) and "form" (morph). The type of rock that a metamorphic rock used to be, prior to metamorphism, is called the protolith.

Sedimentary rocks are formed due to the deposition of material within bodies of water and at the surface of the earth. Metamorphic rocks are formed from existing rock types when subjected to extremely high temperature and pressure.
