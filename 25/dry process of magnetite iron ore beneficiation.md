## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

An iron ore circulating classification beneficiation method includes the steps that (1), raw ore with the grain size ranging from 0 mm to 50 mm is conveyed into a high-pressure roller mill to be subjected to roller pressing, after the roller pressing index reaches the standard, a roller-pressed product is conveyed to a dry magnetic separator to be subjected to dry type separation, and three

## beneficiation of magnetite ore
Eco-efficient and cost- effective process design for magnetite iron ore. Compared to direct shipping hematite ores mined from the upper rego- lith, magnetite deposits require significant beneficiation, which typically involves grinding

## Economic and Socio-Environmental Benefits of Dry Beneficiation of 
In our previous studies, we demonstrated the performance of novel superfine crusher and pneumatic planar magnetic separator as energy-efficient technologies for dry processing of magnetite ores. The present study investigates the economic and socio-environmental benefits of applying these technologies in conceptual dry magnetite ore processing flowsheet. The outcome of the study is compared
