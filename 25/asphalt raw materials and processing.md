## Asphalt raw material from roofing felt - Sitra
Old bitumen sheets used as water insulation material in roofing are usually incinerated or dumped at landfill sites. Tarpaper Recycling is creating a new circular economy market for bitumen sheets in co-operation with industry operators. Now the company has started supplying recycled raw material made from used bitumen sheets for the asphalt industry.
