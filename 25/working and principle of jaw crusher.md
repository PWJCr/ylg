Working Principle of a Jaw Crusher A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces.

Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.

Feb 18, 2021Jaw crushers typically use the principles of compression and friction to break materials down. They're extremely powerful equipment that should be used with the utmost care. Jaw crushers are so powerful that they've earned the moniker "rock breakers" because of their brute force. All jaw crushers will have one fixed jaw and a moving one.
