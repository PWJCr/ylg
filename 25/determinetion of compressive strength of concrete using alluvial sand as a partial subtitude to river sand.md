## Compressive Strength of Concrete and Concrete Testing
The rate of loading is 0.6 Â± 0.2 N/mm 2 /s. Record the maximum force from the machine. The same procedure is followed in the testing of concrete cylinders also. Compressive strength can be calculated from the following equation. Compressive Strength = Applied Maximum Load / Top surface area of the specimen.

## How to Evaluate the Compressive Strength of Concrete - Antoun
Referencing AS 1012.9, the compressive strength of a concrete specimen (cylinder) is calculated by dividing the maximum force applied to the specimen by the cross-sectional area. This area shall be calculated from the average of the two measured diameters of cylinders or side dimensions of cubes.

## Prediction of Compressive Strength of Concrete with Manufactured Sand 
Jul 7, 2021This paper proposes a prediction of the compressive strength of concrete with manufactured sand (MS-concrete) based on an ensemble classification and regression tree (En_CART) method. A data set containing 1,350 original measured strengths of 328 concrete mixtures from actual engineering projects were used for training and testing.
