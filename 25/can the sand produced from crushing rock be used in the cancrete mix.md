Rock quarries crush rock into sizes ranging from 5mm to fine dust. Mineral composition can range widely. They may be softer and break down to dust sooner. The fines and are sold as 'manufactured sand,' 'man-made sand,' 'crusher fines,' or 'stone dust.'. These particles are sharp and will compact tightly if used alone.

The same is true for sand and aggregates recovered from CD&E waste. Given the variability of rock geologies and other man-made aggregates, such as brick and bound concrete, we must also apply the same end-use logic.

The shape of the grain is controlled by the cone crusher. The crushing effect between the particles produced by its special laminated crushing method greatly increases the proportion of cubes in the finished product, reduces the content of needle-like stones, and makes the grain uniform.
