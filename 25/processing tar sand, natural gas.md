## Exxon and Tar Sands Go on Trial in New York Climate Fraud Case
Nowhere is this clearer than in Canada's tar sands, a vast expanse of low-grade hydrocarbons that now make up about 30 percent of Exxon's oil reserves, far more than any of its peers. "Oil sands tick all the boxes when it comes to a carbon-risky asset," said Andrew Logan, who runs the oil and gas program at Ceres, a sustainable

## Unconventional Oil: Tar Sands and Shale Oil - EROI on  - The Oil Drum
The product produced by mining and processing tar sands is usually called syncrude (Syncrude is also the name of a company that produces the product).  In general terms though, it is pretty clear that burning natural gas to extract tar sands is a deeply problematic process, both form the point of view of the other uses possible for this

Some researchers believe the earth in northeastern Alberta is hot enough to use as a sort of "preheater" for major oil sands mines, which use 40-degree Celsius water to separate oil from sand. Most of that heat comes from natural gas; the industry uses about one billion cubic feet of gas a day, or 7 per cent of Canada's daily production

## Coal Oil Shale Tar Sand And Gas Hydrates - Beyond Discovery
Wed, 14 Oct 2020 | Petrochemical Processes. Coal, oil shale, and tar sand are carbonaceous materials that can serve as future energy and chemical sources when oil and gas are consumed. The H/C ratio of these materials is lower than in most crude oils. As solids or semi-solids, they are not easy to handle or to use as fuels, compared to crude oils.

The production of tar sands to liquid fuel requires natural gas to create steam that literally melts the tar off the sand. The recovered crude then needs to be refined. In the end, for every barrel of syncrude produced, around four barrels of water and 1,200 cubic feet of natural gas are required.

## Refining Advertisements of the Canadian Tar Sands.pdf
For some US policymakers, tar sands are a way to help gain energy independence from unstable sources overseas. 27 In 2006, the US Energy Secretary declared that "the hour of the Oil Sands has come" as he announced the development of twenty-two pipelines, thirty-four natural gas pipelines, and ninety-one electric transmission lines bringing

## Tar Sands Challenges - Oil Change International
Because of fracking, natural gas, the main source of energy for extracting and processing tar sands, may remain cheap for years to come. This cushions the cost of producing transport fuel from this low quality oil. If natural gas prices remained at levels seen in 2007/8, tar sands production and processing would be far less profitable.

## What Are Tar Sands? | Union of Concerned Scientists
Tar sands are an increasingly common—but expensive and dirty—source of oil. Tar sands (also known as oil sands) are a mixture of mostly sand, clay, water, and a thick, molasses-like substance called bitumen. Bitumen is made of hydrocarbons—the same molecules in liquid oil—and is used to produce gasoline and other petroleum products.

## Asphalt
Asphalt, also known as bitumen (UK: / ˈ b ɪ tj ʊ m ɪ n /, US: / b ɪ ˈ tj uː m ə n, b aɪ-/), is a sticky, black, highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch.Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos.
