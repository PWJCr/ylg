Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

A reasonable grinding process is determined by the three most important factors: the hardness of the gold ore, the gold ore inlay, and the requirements for the particle size of the grinding product. The grinding process of the CIP gold processing plant is the same as that of the non-ferrous metal ore. There are also one and two stages of grinding.

Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.
