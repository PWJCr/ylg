Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.
