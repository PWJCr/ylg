## Crushed Limestone Driveway Pros and Cons - Designing Idea
Installing a crushed limestone driveway can set homeowners back by about $1.25 to $2 per square foot of driveway space. A 16×48 foot crushed limestone driveway can cost between $960 and $1,536. A smaller driveway may only require a budget of $300 to $350, while a longer and larger driveway may require up to $60,000 in budget.

## Crushed Limestone Driveway Pros and Cons - Designing Idea
Easy Installation: Constructing a crushed limestone driveway is as easy as dumping the rocks into a pre-defined space, distributing them evenly, and compressing them to produce a dense and sturdy surface. On the other hand, asphalt or concrete driveways require more work.

It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

Most limestone quarries and mines produce an abundance of fines. In some cases, with careful screening they can create a marketable aglime or chemical lime without further investment. As these markets expand, the LimeMaster can be added to the operation and greatly increase the production of this valuable product, also known as calcium carbonate.

Their recommendation is to use a coarse-grained sand that complies with ASTM C33 standards. When comparing stone dust vs sand, this sand is definitely an acceptable material to use under pavers. It provides drainage, wont eat away at the pavers, and it compacts well.

## Screenings: What are they? - Gravelshop
Limestone screenings are a relatively cheap, effective option for these horse and animal footing applications as they compact well and are stable (no pun intended) for safety purposes. However, without proper moisture and upkeep the stone dust layer can compact too well, like concrete, and become harmful to the horse's hooves.

## What is Stone Dust and Why Would You Get It? - Nimvo
The stone dust is collected using a screen that keeps the larger pieces of crushed stone above the screen while allowing the rock dust to fall through. This process is the reason why stone dust is often called quarry screenings. Crushed stones are graded by number according to the size of the crushed stone.

Screenings, otherwise known as FA5 or limestone screenings, consist of crushed limestone that is the by-product of the rock mining process. When crushing rock for gravel or rip rap, the material is passed through a variety of screens to catch the larger pieces.
