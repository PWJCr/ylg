##  BARITE FROM CERRO HUARIHUYN, PERU - Celestial Earth Minerals
Barite is a major industrial mineral and the source of all barium and barium compounds. Some eight million metric tons of barite are recovered worldwide each year by open-pit mining of barite-rich sandstone. Because of barite's substantial density, crushed ore is easily concentrated by hydraulic, gravitational-separation methods.

Baryte is a light blue ore that spawns at 1000m to 2000m below. It is fairly common while mining downwards. Baryte can be found both in caves and on its own, however, it is a little more common in caves around 1100m. It is a very fast ore to mine relative to its depth. It gives 5000 XP when mined. It is recommended to search for it between 1000m to 1400m where the ore diversity is lower
