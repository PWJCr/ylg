The higher the value of 'n', the narrower the particle size distribution. .. Vertical mills tend to produce cement with a higher value of 'n'. .. Values of 'n' normally lie between 0.8 and 1.2, dependent particularly on cement fineness. #cement #Particle_Size_Distribution

A particle size distribution indicates the percentage of particles of a certain size (or in a certain size interval). These intervals are also called size classes or fractions. A simple example is shown below. Here, a mixture of grinding balls has been separated by size: 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 40 mm: 5 mm. 10 mm. 15 mm.

## The effect of particle size distribution on an experimental glass 
Objectives: The role of particle size and size distribution of glass powders in glass-ionomer cements (GICs) has been largely overlooked, being limited to demonstrations of the classical inverse size-strength relationship. This study investigated variation in properties of an experimental glass-ionomer cement when a combination of large ('Powder A') and small ('Powder B') particles was used.

A theoretical approach to determination of particle size distribution of crushing products was presented by Kolmogorow (1941) and Epstein (1947), who proved that for a multi-stage comminution process, the particle size distributions of products are log-normal. The product particle size distribution depends on the crushing process intensity (stage).
