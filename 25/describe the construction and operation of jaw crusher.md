## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste ( gangue) material. Waste material can be discarded or

A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces. The movement of the jaw crusher is
