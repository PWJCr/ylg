The first coal chemical recovery ovens were installed in the United States in 1893. By 1915, by-product ovens accounted for 97% of the metallurgical coke produced in the United States. These by-product ovens produced coal tar as one of the major by-products. An industry developed around distillation of coal tar to produce various products.
