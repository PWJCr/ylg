Products are mainly used in dense - medium cyclone, chutes and hoppers with serious impact in mining industry.The inner wall of the groove is often subjected to the wear and impact of materials, which often leads to the damage of the groove wall. The wear-resisting ceramics pasted on the inner wall of the groove can effectively reduce wear.

## Wear of Materials - Causes and Characteristics - Nuclear Power
Impact wear is of the highest impostance in mining nad mineral processing. Mining and mineral processing demand wear-resistant machines and components, because the energies and masses of interacting bodies are significant. For this purposes, materials with the highest wear-resistance must be used.

## Mining Industry Applications: Plastic Wear & Power Transmission Parts
UHMW is the perfect barrier between metal and nearly any mined material in commercial applications as it does not freeze-bond allowing for quick discharge times. Many coal mining and ore mining operations have switched from using stainless steel for linings and hoppers, instead choosing UHMW as it greatly reduces heat buildup due to friction.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.
