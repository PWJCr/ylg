##  TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS - Mineral Tech
Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1. Gyratory crushers can produce size reduction ratios over a somewhat larger range of 3:1 to 10:1. The primary operating variable available on a crusher is the set and on jaw and gyratory the open-side set (OSS) is specified. This reflects the fact that considerable

## Cone Crusher Reduction Ratios
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 61 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 34 closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 34 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 81 may.

## Cone Crusher Reduction
The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher. This is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Reduction ratios in the following ranges are common for cone crushers: 6:1 - 8:1 for secondaries 4:1 - 6:1 for tertiary and quaternary crushing.

## Introduction to Rock Crushers
Jaw crushers normally take the mined material and reduce it to a manageable size -say 10 to 4 inches. Cone crushers take the material from a jaw crusher and further reduce the material size. Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio.

## Reduction ratio for jaw crusher - Consuol Mining Machinery
Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule, jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept

## Crushing 101 » Masaba Manufacturing
CONE CRUSHER. 8:1 maximum reduction ratio for compression crushing and is normally used as a secondary or tertiary crusher. Lower wear cost than imp actors. Good capacity down to around ½". Production drops off dramatically when producing smaller materials. Even with the new high-speed, high-throw cones.

Gyradisk Cone Crusher. For finer size products (e.g., -6 mm), a special cone crusher known as the Gyradisc is commonly used. Operation is similar to the Standard Cone Head; however, breakage is mostly by attrition rather than impact. Reduction ratio is around 8:1. Feed size is limited to less than 50 mm with a nip angle between 25 ° and 30 °.

Typically applied in secondary and tertiary stages, the cone crusher produces reduction ratios of 6:1 to 4:1. Bushing cones, like Superior's Patriot Cone Crusher, consist of a rotating mantle inside a steel bowl. As rock is compressed between the mantle and the bowl, the force generated fractures the material.
