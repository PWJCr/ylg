Figure 1: The process used to manufacture various phosphate fertilizers. Dry vs. wet process. In the dry process, an electric furnace treats rock phosphate. This treatment produces a very pure and more expensive phosphoric acid - frequently called white or furnace acid - primarily used in the food and chemical industry.

The beneficiation plant makes use of about 85% of the total volume of process water used in phosphate rock production. Phosphate rocks from crushing and screening, which contain about 60% tricalcium phosphate, are fed into the beneficiation plant for upgrading by rejection of the larger than 4 mm over-size particles.

## Using Nanotechnology For Rock Phosphate Processing
Phosphate rock was first mined in England in 1847 for use as a fertilizer. It was in 1881 that Captain J. Francis LeBaron, of the Army Corps of Engineers, discovered Florida's treasure in black phosphate pebbles in the Peace River. A "hard rock" phosphate reserve in North Central Florida was discovered next.
