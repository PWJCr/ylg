Nov 15, 2021The method of internal grinding We must adjust the position of the grinding wheel before grinding. When grinding the inner hole on the universal cylindrical grinder, the grinding wheel is in contact with the front wall of the hole. At this time, the lateral feed direction of the grinding wheel is the same as when grinding the outer circle.

Speed up The Workhead: Sometimes increasing the rotational speed of the part will fix the problem. This is especially true if roundness issues are resulting from a harmonic, which is eliminated by changing the workhead speed. Going faster also reduces the depth of cut per revolution which often reduces grinding forces, deflection, vibration, etc.

Grinding. Grinding is a finishing process used to improve surface finish, abrade hard materials, and tighten the tolerance on flat and cylindrical surfaces by removing a small amount of material. Information in this section is organized according to the subcategory links in the menu bar to the left. In grinding, an abrasive material rubs against the metal part and removes tiny pieces of material.

High surface quality achieved with ELID grinding method mainly depends on the formation of the oxide layer (Ohmori et al., 2002).Fig. 1 illustrates the mechanism of ELID grinding. The ELID process is based on a metal-bonded grinding wheel used as an anode, while a metallic electrode is used as a cathode.
