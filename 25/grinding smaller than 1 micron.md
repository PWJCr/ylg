The fast grind speed is largely due to the large 48mm stainless steel burrs, which make short work of grinding. Surprisingly the 1Zpresso JX is faster than the JX-Pro. Grinding an 18g dose for pour-over takes about 20 seconds with the JX and about 30 seconds with the JX-Pro. 1Zpresso J-Max a new kid will arrive on the block. Grinders are one of

sterile filtrations were rated as being 0.45 11m in pore size. They met with impressive successes. The common view concerning filters at that time was, indeed still is, that they retain particles, whether viable or not, solely by sieving; the size discrimination arising because the pores are smaller than the particles, thus interdicting their passage..

## grinding smaller than micron
What is a micron? Big particles of dust are considered to be between 2.5 and 10 microns in size, where small particles are 2.5 microns and smaller. 2.0 microns are 50 times smaller than a typical human hair. We do this by using two wheels and a support in between the two wheels. The one wheel is called a grinding wheel, the other a regulating

## MERV RATINGS AND DUST SIZE - Imperial Systems, Inc.
The MERV rating tells you what percent of particles in that size range the filter will capture. Here are some examples: MERV 6 - between 35 and 50% efficient for dust size bigger than 3 microns. MERV 10 - between 50 and 65% for dust size from 1 to 3 microns. MERV 15 - between 85 and 95% for dust size smaller than 1 micron.
