## Community Engagement and Participation In Mining Projects: A South 
In South Africa, there are a number of ambiguities in the existing law regulating community participation processes in mining projects, including the MPRDA and MPRDA Guidelines. This limits the involvement of communities in projects, potentially creating a recipe for greater social mistrust and conflict. For this reason, mining companies have to go all-out to involve communities in their

## Communities, mining corporations and corruption in South Africa
During the apartheid era in South Africa, the mining industry operated without restraint and had undue influence over government decision-making.  Mining companies have also used the fact that people living in communities earmarked for mining are poor, and most don't have jobs. In the Sakhelwe township in Dullstroom, the offer of jobs was

## the year of upliftment for mining communities in South Africa - Prisma
Jan 13, 2022The communities surrounding mines have a critical role to play, not only in the feasibility of a mine, but in the long-term viability of the area after mining resources have dried up. Mining organisations have both a legal and moral obligation to ensure that the greater community is uplifted and that people in the area can become involved.

## Mining towns and urban sprawl in South Africa - ScienceDirect
South Africa's mining towns were established by mining companies mostly after World War II. The workforce lived in company-owned or privately-owned houses, or high-density compounds. Since the demise of apartheid, South African government policy for these towns has promoted integrated mining communities and homeownership.

## Problems in the mining industry in South africa - ECDPM
The current turbulence in the mining industry in South Africa has its roots in several different factors. First, the fall in global demand for platinum and other minerals due to recession; second, the consequences of the Marikana disaster in destabilising labour relations; and third, the structural character of our mining industry. A great deal has been written about the first two factors, so
