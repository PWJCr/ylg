Iron ore fines are characterized on a physical basis by variations in particle size, shape, density, porosity, surface area, roughness, and wettability. Furui et al. (1977) divided iron ore particles into nucleus particles of +0.7 mm, intermediate particles of −0.7 + 0.2 mm and adhering particles of −0.2 mm.

## Iron (Fe) - Melting Point, Atomic Mass & Number, Chemical and Physical 
Physical Properties of Iron It rusts in damp air, but not in the dry air. It dissolves readily in dilute acids. At room temperature, this metal is in the form of ferrite or α-form. At 910°C, it changes to γ-iron, which is much softer in nature. It melts at 1536°C and boils at 2861°C. Being a metal is magnetic in nature.

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## Concentration of Ores: Hydraulic Washing, Froth Flotation with Examples
Another method of concentration of ores is the Froth Flotation Method. This is the process for concentration of primarily sulphide ores. It has the advantage over gravity separation because it can collect even the extremely fine particles of minerals. The process uses the difference in the wetting characteristics of minerals and gangue.
