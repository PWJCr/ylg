Mining's contribution to total economic production climbed in the 1970s to peak at 21% in 1980 1. Contributing to the upward surge in 1980 was a relatively high gold price. In other words, for every R100 that the South African economy produced that year, R21 was due to mining. In 1987, employment in the industry peaked at just over 760 000

## Why Is Coal So Important For South Africa
South Africa's indigenous energy resource base is dominated by coal. Approximately 77% of South Africa's primary energy needs are supplied by coal. South Africa is highly dependent on coal as an energy source; the fuel provides approximately 73% of primary energy and almost 90% of its energy comes from coal-fired power stations.

## The future of coal in South Africa - Technology for Mining
The South African government has a plan for energy projection up to 2030. The hope is that an additional generating capacity of 9.5 GW of wind, 6.8 GW of solar, 6.7 GW of coal, and 2.5 GW of hydropower will be available by that time. This would still mean that South Africa would still be acquiring 64% of its power from coal.
