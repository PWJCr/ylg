## Zoning and resorption of plagioclase in a layered gabbro, as a 
The Murotomisaki Gabbroic Intrusion is a sill-like layered gabbro emplaced in sedimentary strata of Tertiary age in southwest Japan. The zoning (including resorption structures) and the compositional variations of plagioclase from throughout the intrusion were studied, and it was found that the zoning pattern may be classified into four types, which may well correlated with the hosting rock

## Gabbro - Igneous rocks - Sandatlas
Gabbro is a coarse-grained and usually dark-colored igneous rock.It is an intrusive rock. It means that it formed as magma cooled slowly in the crust. Igneous rocks with similar composition are basalt (extrusive equivalent of gabbro) and diabase (the same rock type could be named dolerite or microgabbro instead).. Gabbro with large augite phenocrysts embedded in white plagioclase.

Gabbro (/ ˈ ɡ æ b. r oʊ /) is a phaneritic (coarse-grained), mafic intrusive igneous rock formed from the slow cooling of magnesium-rich and iron-rich magma into a holocrystalline mass deep beneath the Earth's surface. Slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro is chemically equivalent to rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt.Much of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of gabbro, formed at mid-ocean
