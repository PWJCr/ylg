Alternative techniques are NTA, TRPS and FC based methods. The TRPS method is advantageous as it provides a readout of concentration of virus particles at different size distributions, where a percentage of viral aggregates could be calculated. However, DLS, NTA, and TRPS methods could handle a single sample measurement at the same time.

## Rapid Synthesis of Kaolinite Nanoscrolls through Microwave Processing
The nanoscrolls averaged about 1 μm in length with outer diameters of APTMS and CTAC intercalated samples of 37.3 ± 8.8 nm and 24.9 ± 6.1 nm, respectively. The availability of methods for the rapid production of kaolinite nanoscrolls will lead to greater utility of these materials in technologically significant applications. View Full-Text
