## Crushed Stone: The Unsung Mineral Hero - Geology
Limestone is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). It is the rock type most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. It holds this position because it is widely available and suitable for a greater diversity of uses than any other type of rock. Limestone can be used to make cement.

The reason concrete cannot be made simply by mixing sand with cement is that it is a composite material that needs a coarse aggregate to achieve this strength. In essence, concrete is a mixture of Portland cement, water, sand, and rocks. The cement or paste coats and binds the sand and rocks. Then, a chemical reaction called hydration, which is

## drainage - Should I add sand or more limestone crush to raise a patio 
Edit 6 years later: I re graded the patio adding more crushed stone. In retrospective I think that building without sand but using a finer crushed stone is a newer way to build a patio bed and it needs solid compacting before putting the cement bricks back but it worked and it never moved an inch over these 6Y.

Limestone has a lot of uses in various industries. We cut limestones into bricks, paver, or tiles in the construction industry or pulverize them for cement production. We can also crush limestones and use them as aggregates to mix with cement and sand for different concrete and mortar mixes. Other industries also use limestone, such as manufacturing paper, glass, and even paint.

Moreover,. Crushed limestone aggregates proved nearly 10% of high in strength compared to traditional gravels used in cement-concrete mixer. The strength comes from the angular shapes and sharp edges of crushed limestone aggregates compared to rounded-shaped gravels obtained from natural resources, which formed through weathering processes.

##  Crshed Limestone Sand: an Effectie Alternatie to Natral Sand in Concrete
Modified Crushed Sand, is constructed from initial crushed sand by reducing its high fines percentage to 5.05% to fit the ASTM C33 (2016) gradation limits. The specific gradation of this initial crushed sand has been produced by a quarry, specifically for this research study. Figure 1. Particles size distribution of aggregates. 2.2 Mix Proportions

The sand which is used in mortar can be natural sand, or crushed stone sand or crushed gravel sand. Sand or fine aggregate which is used in concrete is somewhat different from sand which is used for masonry mortar.

## Choosing the Right Paver Base Material | Nitterhouse Masonry
The best aggregate for paver bases is a quarry processed dense grade aggregate. Quarry processing creates a combination of 3/4-inch crushed stone and stone dust. This mixture binds well and increases durability, making it one of the best materials for maximum strength and cohesion. 3. Recycled Concrete Aggregate.
