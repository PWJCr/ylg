## History of mining in alabamaach-haeusle
In many districts the prospectors followed gold- bearing gravel to the source of the gold in veins, and lode mining began shortly after placer mining. It was not, however, until about the middle 1860's, when the Mother Lode and Grass Valley loes in 1853. It then declined steadily and in 1862 again dropped below the 2-million-ounce level.

The first reported commercial mining of coal in Ohio was in 1800 in Jefferson County, with just 100 tons being produced. Since 1800, 3.7 billion tons of coal have been mined in Ohio, 2.3 billion tons from underground mines and 1.4 billion tons from surface mines. Most of Ohio's coal mines existed in eastern and southern parts of the state.
