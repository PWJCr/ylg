## How To Harvest Clay For Pottery & Natural Building - Rural Sprout
Wet processing of clay Outside of dry processing - crushing, sieving and pulverizing into a powder - you can also choose to wet process your clay. This is also known as the wet extraction method. This is the more time-consuming approach, though it is much easier on your muscles. Let the clay and the water do the work instead of you.

The potter sits at a simple wheel fashioning a vessel from a conical lump of clay. An assistant turns the wheel and aids the potter with the clay. Behind the potter are rows of vessels, probably newly formed and in the process of drying. In the foreground another assistant kneads clay with his feet, preparing it for the potter.

There are two main types of processing: wet and dry. Wet processing is quite straightforward, and is the best way of removing any unwanted debris from the clay, such as roots, rocks, twigs, and other organic matter. The clay should be crushed using a large mallet or other heavy object, and then once it's dry it's put through a sieve.
