## Coal | Geoscience Australia
Mining. In Australia, nearly 80% of coal is produced from open-cut mines, in contrast to the rest of the world where open-cut mining only accounts for 40% of coal production. Open-cut mining is possible because coal seams are close to the surface. Such mining is cheaper than underground mining and enables up to 90% recovery of the resource.
