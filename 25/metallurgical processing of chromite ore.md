## A Process Mineralogical Evaluation of Chromite at the Nkomati  - MDPI
Chromite is a member of the spinel group and is the only economically important ore mineral of chromium. It is used extensively by the metallurgical industry as feedstock for ferroalloy production [1,2,3,4].Chromite ore is commonly classified into different grades based on the Cr/Fe ratio as well as the Cr 2 O 3 content. These being metallurgical grade, chemical grade and refractory grade [].

Technology Innovations in the Smelting of Chromite Ore. it is designed for smelting fine chromite ores. The convectional smelting process is designed to handle only lumpy ores which are ideal for ferrochromium production as the fine ores tend to form a sintered layer at the top of the charge, preventing gas escape and thus causing operating difficulties (Buchanan, 2001).

## Chromite Sand | Chrome Sand | Suppliers | HAIXU | CHINA
Our main goal is becoming a global high-quality chromite sand producer and service provider. The chromite sand in our modern facilities are mainly South Africa chromite sand.The industrial applications are : casting sands in cores and moulds in steel and iron foundries, base material in sliding gate mixes, plugging sands in ladles at steelworks, chrome-magnesia or magnesia-chrome bricks.

## introduction of processing of chromite ores
Equipment and methodology of testwork at mintek804 ÐšÐ±. Mintek has developed and patented the smelting of chromite ores in DC electric open-arc furnaces; principally for the processing of ore fines of sizes less than 1 mmUsing the data collected over a series of DC arc furnace campaigns, the metallurgical control of the alloy composition is discussed.
