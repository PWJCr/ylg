## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## Beneficiation of Low/Off Grade Iron Ore: a Review
The beneficiation of iron ore is relatively more effective, when RAF operation applied along with magnetic concentration. Data indicate that it enhance the Fe% value from 29% of Fe to 50 % Fe. The magnetic operation removes the slimes, which beneficiate the iron ore of 65.22% of Fe whereas recovery percentage has been calculated 78.42% (Zhu
