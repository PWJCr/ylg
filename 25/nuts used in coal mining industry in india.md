## What is the Mining Industry? - PIMS Group
Australia's coal mining story began with the discovery of coal in Newcastle, NSW in 1791, and coal was first exported from Australia in 1799. 60% of worldwide coal mining is underground mining, however, 80% of Australian coal mining is via open-cut mines. This is more affordable than underground mining and elicits resource recovery rates of 90%.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

At present, India's overall installed renewable capacity is 87.66 GW and of installed solar power capacity is around 35 GW. However, the push and focus on renewable do not mean India is cutting down its focus on coal. According to CIL, in the next five years, it is going to open 55 new coal mines and expand at least 193 present ones.
