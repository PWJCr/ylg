Composting is the process of breaking down plant materials such as leaves and grass clippings to a more usable organic soil amendment or mulch. Composting yard, garden, and some food wastes creates a valuable soil amendment. Compost improves the drainage and aeration of heavy clay soils and increases the moisture-holding ability of sandy soils.

## recovering gold from sand and gravel
To- day, placer gold production comes from the dredge operating at Hammonton, from large placer mines employing the cya- nide process, from byproduct recovery in sand and gravel plants, from small placer mines, and from small dredging op- erations in rivers and streams.
