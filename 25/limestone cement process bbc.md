## Portland Limestone Cement Makes Concrete Greener
It generates more than 525 kg of CO2 per ton of clinker. Therefore, using less clinker is key to more sustainable concrete. Type IL cements do just that. Portland cement is about 91 percent clinker, while PLC is just 83 percent clinker. Limestone content is up to five percent in ordinary Portland cement (OPC), but as high as 15 percent in PLC.

## High limestone content in cement: An important step towards decarbonisation
For example, the carbonation resistance of concrete with a cement with only 15 mass % limestone was equal to that of a cement with 30 or even 50 mass % limestone when the w/c ratio was reduced from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3 (Figure 3). Of course, sophisticated process measures in cement plants are necessary for the production of high-limestone cements.
