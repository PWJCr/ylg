## The three stages of post-construction cleaning - Legally Clean
Jan 12, 2022There are various phases to the post-construction cleaning process. The first phase involves a thorough dusting, sweeping, and vacuuming of the property. Next, the crew will remove any stickers or remnants of paint or plaster from the walls, floors, and windows. This final phase is also the most time-consuming and intensive.

Dynamic surface finishes. Piston rods are generally hard chrome plated. The hardness target should be at least 67 Rockwell C (900 HV/10). This gives an excellent tribological surface, and provided the rods are produced by an established supplier within a surface finish range of 0.1 to 0.3 μm Ra (4-12 μin Ra), no major problem should ensue.
