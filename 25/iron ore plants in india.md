## How Many Iron Ore Mines Are There In India? | Eriered Cross
There Are Nearly 315 Mines In. Now that the mines in odisha are functional, india can even export iron ore. In 1975, the geological survey of india located 34 iron bearing reserves with estimated the total ore deposits of 390 million tonnes. Iron ore from these mines is exported to japan, south korea via the vishakhapatnam port.

In Britain, iron ore was found embedded with coal seams= same area provided both iron ore + coal; During that era, to process 1 tons of iron ore, you needed 8-12 tons of coal. Railway engines were also inefficient. So, weight-wise, it was cheaper to transport iron ore to coalfields rather than transporting coal to iron ore site.

The ore after crushing to -3" size was attrition ground and washed in a concrete mixer. But there was not much improvement in the grade of the coarse fraction, because of the small clay content in the ore.

The shortage of high quality iron ore is causing a problem for the production of iron and steel in the state. Currently Karnataka produces around 27 MTPA iron ore. This is much lower than the demand of the iron and steel plants in the state. The demand and supply of iron ore has to be balanced for smooth growth of the industry in the state.
