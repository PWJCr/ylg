Rock Crushing Process in Mining. Let's follow a rock through a crushing cycle to see what variables will have to be controlled. First the rock will enter the crushing chamber and drop as far as the angle of the crushing surface will allow it to. The crusher "breaks it and the fine material produced will drop through the gap between the mantle

## 25.3 Crushing and milling | Mining of mineral resources | Siyavula
Rocks with large concentrations of minerals, are called ores. Mining depends on finding good quality ore, preferably within a small area. The next step is to get the rocks which contain the mineral out of the ground. Once the ore is on the surface, the process of getting the mineral you want out of the rock can start.
