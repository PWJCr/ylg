Basic Concrete Blocks: Some people decide to put a non-concrete shed on top of some concrete blocks around the edges and corners. Although this type of foundation might take some math to get the measurements figured out, it eliminates the need to level the ground. It is hard to estimate a cost without knowing how many concrete blocks you need. The most recommended way to anchor your metal shed
