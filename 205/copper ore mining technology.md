For lower-grade deposits located near the surface, the open-pit method is the most practical for the mining of large tonnages of material. Large track-mounted drills prepare the ore for blasting, and the broken ore is hauled to the ore-dressing plant by truck (at up to 150 tons per load) or conveyor. In underground mining, vertical shafts are sunk well over 1,000 metres (3,300 feet) below the

## Copper Ore Mining Hazards | Axora
One major concern of copper mining is the inhalation of silica dust particles, which leads to the development of silicosis, pneumoconiosis, or tuberculosis. Mining for copper sulphide ore, like chalcopyrite, is particularly hazardous to human health because of the number of toxins it releases, including methylmercury, lead, arsenic, asbestos

## Test Of Copper Ore With Sulfuric Acid ( H2SO4 ) Videos
Technology Industry Of Gold Mining  Wait for the extraction of copper ore dissolves ( Dilution could be about 1 or 2 hours, and longer also be better ) The results of the Process from copper ore extraction with sulfuric acid ( H2SO4 ) an insoluble metal oxide is reacted with a dilute acid to form a soluble salt. Sulfuric acid react to

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores. El Teniente, in Chile, is the world's largest
