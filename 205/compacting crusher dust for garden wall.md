Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.

## What crusher dust is - Blog Paragon Gardens
When it comes to a healthy and robust lawn or any other plant, compaction is the enemy. When turf is grown in crusher dust, which means that it is growing in rock, it has shallow root growth causing the plant to always be thirsty and reliant on frequent watering. As we know, this has a disastrous result in times of drought and water restrictions.

(Actually, order to cover 4", but the only lay down half, compact that, then lay down the other half, then compact that.) In other words, you don't typically order the stone to allow for compaction. You order the stone based on the volume needed prior to compaction. UPDATE:

1. Backfilling with dirt. If you use dirt as your backfill or base, your pavers will sink, rotate, and separate. Instead of having a smooth surface, you'll have a bumpy, uneven surface. Here's why: dirt shrinks by 30% when compacted. That means, if you backfill with dirt, your hardscape will settle 30%.

By nature of the product, crusher dust is easy to work with, spread, and level out. As the material settles, the dust and smaller pieces fill the gaps between larger pieces of stone, creating a smooth and compact surface. The material is tightly packed, which means there is no shifting, no moving, and no potholes developing over time.

## Stone Dust Doesn't Belong Under Pavers. Here's Why.
Stone dust is a fine material that absorbs moisture readily, then releases it slowly. The same properties that work wonders for organic gardening can wreak havoc underneath pavers, causing efflorescence and allowing them to settle or shift easily under load. In extreme frost-thaw cycles, water-soaked stone dust can actually pump up through the

## Strength and Permeability Characteristics Study of Self-Compacting 
This paper aims to focus permeability study of self-compacting concrete (SCC) made with industrial wastes, i.e., marble sludge powder (MSP) from marble processing and crusher rock dust (CRD) from stone crushing industries. MSP can be used as filler and it helps to reduce the total voids content in concrete.

## Crusher Dust | Centenary Landscaping
Crusher Dust is a a finely graded crushed blue stone similar to Roadbase. It can be compacted firm and used as a sub-base for a variety of applications. Under pavers we recommend you use Roadbase due to its superior drainage and lower mineral content (high mineral content and moisture content can casue Efflorescence to appear). 1.6 Tonne = 1m 3.
