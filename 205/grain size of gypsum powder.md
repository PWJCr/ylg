## Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials
As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft. Note, kg/cu.m divided by 16.02 = lbs/cu.ft.

The grain size of powders milled at low temperatures was smaller than those milled at higher temperatures. For example, the grain size of copper milled at room temperature was 26 Â± 3 nm, while that milled at -85 Â°C was only 17 Â± 2 nm (Shen and Koch, 1995). Similar results were reported for other metals and the CoZr intermetallic compound.

Gypsum is moderately water-soluble (~2.0-2.5 g/L at 25 Â°C) and, in contrast to most other salts, it exhibits a retrograde solubility, becoming less soluble at higher temperatures. so taking this as fact if gypsum is added to increase yield shouldnt the amount of gypsum added to the soak water be based on the total volume of soak water?
