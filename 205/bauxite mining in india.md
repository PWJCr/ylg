But bauxite mining excavates a huge surface area, and has caused environmental devastation in Jamaica, Guinea, Australia, India and recently also in Vietnam. Perhaps no bauxite deposits are located in more sensitive areas than those in India, whose most significant deposits occur as cappings on the biggest mountains in south Orissa and north

## Assessing the impact of mining on deforestation in India
Bauxite mining in the hills of Kalahandi and Koraput districts of Odisha in Eastern India has created tensions between the tribal (adivasis) residents and the mining interest groups for the same reasons (Oskarsson, 2017). Mining promotes urbanization and immigration, resulting in economic growth and infrastructure development.

Following the Supreme Court's decision, Vedanta's plans to mine Niyamgiri hills for Bauxite have now been completely stalled and have cost the company up to $10 billion (Chaturvedi, 2014). The scarcity of bauxite has also meant the refinery being shut down intermittently in the past, resulting in widespread economic losses for Vedanta.
