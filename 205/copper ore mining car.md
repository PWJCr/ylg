## ore type mining cars
Jul 09, 2020· Depending on ore type and location, overburden ranges from about 3 to 20 tons of earth removed to access each ton of ore.(i) This means that accessing about 90,000 pounds of ore requires digging and moving between 200,000 and over 1,500,000 pounds of earth—a rough average of more than 500,000 pounds per battery.

Copper Ore is the first ore to being mined, and is mined from Copper Veins. A mining pick and the Mining profession are required to mine. Copper Veins may be found in many starting areas where the typical creature level is between about 5 and 18. Mining Copper stops giving skillups at 100. The most common zones to have Copper Veins are: Elwynn Forest - High Dun Morogh - High Northwest Loch

Copper mining in the Upper Peninsula boomed, and from 1845 until 1887 (when it was exceeded by Butte, Montana) the Michigan Copper Country was the nation's leading producer of copper. In most years from 1850 through 1881, Michigan produced more than three-quarters of the nation's copper, and in 1869 produced more than 95% of the country's copper.
