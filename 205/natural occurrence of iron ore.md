## Occurrence and Properties of Metals | Boundless Chemistry - Course Hero
Over geological time scales, very few metals can resist natural weathering processes like oxidation. This is why only the less reactive metals such as gold and platinum are found as native metals. The others usually occur as isolated pockets where a natural chemical process reduces a common compound or ore of the metal.

## 「occurrence of iron ore」
Natural Occurrence. Iron Ore is themon mineral found underground. They are found at all stone levels, butmonly from bedrock level level 64. Veins of iron ore vary, but themon is a 2x2x2 square 8 iron. Veins vary from 4 10. Sometimes, iron ore veins generate next to each other, making more then 10. Know more

## Aluminium: Natural occurrence
Aluminium is a strongly reactive metal that forms a high-energy chemical bond with oxygen. Compared to most other metals, it is difficult to extract from ore, such as bauxite, due to the energy required to reduce aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3).For example, direct reduction with carbon, as is used to produce iron, is not chemically possible, since aluminium is a stronger reducing agent than carbon.

The occurrences and geochemical characteristics of Although iron ore currently extracted from the Bayan Obo deposit (Table 1) is the main raw material for ore dressing and smelting, a single iron ore type sample is not representative of the whole deposit Iron ore combined samples were therefore prepared and tested to accurately identify the average distribution rate of thorium in each mineral
