The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.- ore and 25 steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size. The ball milling process is carried out for approximately h to obtain uniform-sized fine powder. In high-energy ball milling, vacuum or a specific gaseous atmosphere is maintained inside the chamber.
