Most crushers used for aggregate production can be categorised as one of three main types: Compression crushers - which squeeze the material until it breaks. Impact crushers - which use the principle of rapid impact to shatter material. A ttrition crushers - which use both impact and grinding to shear material.

Igneous Rock. Igneous rock is one of the three main rock types. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallisation, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks.. This magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle
