## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.
