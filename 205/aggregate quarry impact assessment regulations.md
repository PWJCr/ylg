## Tunstead Quarry Environmental Impact Assessment | Case Study - Hafren Water
Scope. Tunstead Quarry is located approximately 4km east of Buxton, Derbyshire. Carboniferous limestone is extracted for use in cement manufacture as well as for general aggregate use and quarrying has been on-going since 1929. A Review of Mineral Planning (ROMP) assessment is periodically required to ensure Planning Conditions are appropriate

Hydrogeological Impact Assessment Hydrogeological assessments are required for some subdivision applications when triggered by various criteria such as reduced parcel sizes or sensitive features. The primary reasons for hydrogeological assessments are to protect against groundwater and surface water contamination, and to limit groundwater mounding.

## A quarry is a type of open-pit mine in which dimension stone, rock 
A quarry is a type of open-pit mine in which dimension stone, rock, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, gravel, or slate is excavated from the ground. The operation of quarries is regulated in some jurisdictions to reduce their environmental impact. Also see "Quarry" on Wikipedia. English to Marathi Dictionary: quarry. Acknowledgment of Country.

At all three sites, the quarry dewatering has altered the local ground-water hydrology. In essence, the quarries act as huge wells, lowering the water table in the aquifer. The impact of the dewatering at the Kraemer Quarry is shown in Figure 2. This lowering could affect Figure 2. The impacts on ground-water levels of drawdown at Kraemer Quarry.
