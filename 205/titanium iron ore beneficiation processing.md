Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing, tailings were discarded with three scavenging, middlings returned to efficient thickener. Finally, iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%.

## Ilmenite: An Ore of Titanium | Beneficiation and Plant
Sep 8, 2022It can reduce unnecessary investment in equipment to obtain ideal beneficiation results. Ilmenite is a black iron-titanium oxide (FeTiO 3) with the main mineral components of hematite, magnetite, pyrite, pyroxene, and amphibole. Ilmenite in placer deposits often contains a large amount of slime. Ilmenite mineral's Mohs scale hardness is 5-6.

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and
