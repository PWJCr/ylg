The Hall-Heroult process is widely used in the extraction of aluminium. In Hall-Heroults process, pure Al 2 O 3 is mixed with CaF 2 or Na 3 AlF 6. This results in lowering the melting point of the mixture and increases its ability to conduct electricity. A steel vessel with a lining of carbon and graphite rods is used.

The processing of the bauxite to form aluminium, goes through a 4 stage power consuming process which includes mining, refining of the bauxite ore into alumina, smelting of alumina into aluminum ingots which are then finally cast into sheets or col for use in industries. Ghana exports various forms of the aluminium.

Vedanta is an integrated producer of Aluminum in India with mines, smelters and associated power plants. Korba (Chhattisgarh) and Jharsuguda (Odisha) Both places have bauxite and coal deposits. Vedanta uses that coal for generating thermal electricity in its own captive power plants. Same electricity used for refining alumina to aluminum.

## Extraction of Aluminium from Bauxite by Bayer's & Hall's Process - Embibe
Jul 19, 2022The Bayer Process, developed by Carl Josef Bayer. is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide). In this process, aluminium ore is treated with concentrated sodium hydroxide to form a soluble sodium aluminate. Sodium aluminate is filtered, and the filtrate on heating with water gives aluminium hydroxide.

## The Transformation of Bauxite to Aluminum (and the Products in Between)
An electrical current is run through the mixture, causing the carbon from the carbon anode to attach to the oxygen component in the alumina, yielding aluminum and carbon dioxide: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C > 4 Al + 3 CO2. This process takes place at temperatures between º C and yields an aluminum of high purity.
