Rubble Tips: Before laying your rubble base, excavating at least 100mm of soil is required. After the quarry rubble is laid it must be compacted before quarry sand is laid, then compacted again. This produces a firm base to lay pavers, artificial grass, steps or even small pebbles for a garden path.
