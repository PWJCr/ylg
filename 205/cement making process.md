Concrete: Manufacturing Process . A good quality concrete is essentially a homogeneous mixture of cement, coarse and fine aggregates and water which consolidates into a hard mass due to chemical action between the cement and water. Each of the four constituents has a specific function. The coarser aggregate acts as a filler.

Clinker calcination is the most important stage in the cement making process, and it is also a stage with high energy consumption and large gas emission. To produce one ton of cement clinker, it needs to consume 1.58 to 1.621 tons of raw materials, 0.10-0.12 tons of coal, and emit about 1 ton of carbon dioxide.

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
