## Mineralogical and Chemical Characterization of Low Grade Iron Ore Fines 
The consumption of iron ore has increased rapidly over the past decade due to the tremendous growth of iron and steel industry. The depletion of high grade iron ore resources make it inevitable to utilize the existing low grade iron ores/fines/tailings with effective beneficiation to meet the present specification and demand. Enormous amounts of fines are produced both from the natural

High grade iron ores (iron content greater than 62 %) are simply crushed, screened and shipped directly to the iron making unit (e.g. blast furnace).  This leads to a mathematical resource estimation to estimate the size and grade of the deposit. Mining iron ore begins at ground level. Ore is identified by diamond drilling core samples on a

The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Applied Sciences | Free Full-Text | Spectral Alteration Zonation  - MDPI
Nov 25, 2020Research on wall rock alteration is of great importance to the understanding and exploration of ore deposits. The microscopic changes of the same mineral in different alteration zones can provide information about the migration and enrichment of ore-forming elements. In this paper, a typical profile of a high-grade iron ore body in Gongchangling iron deposit was investigated and sampled. The

## The geology and genesis of high grade hematite ore deposits
This paper presents a first summary of results of an ongoing study, started some two years ago, of high-grade iron ore deposits in South Africa, India and Brazil, including a comparison with the

## Interest in Steenkampskraal with highest grades of rare earths worldwide
The rare earth elements (REEs) deposit at the Steenkampskraal mine has been confirmed to be the highest grade in the world, at 14.4% (REE), with the rare earth grade in some areas as high as 45% TREO + Y 2 O 3 (total rare earth oxides + yttrium oxide). The Steenkampskraal project has many favourable attributes including its mining-friendly

## Iron Deposits - Banded Iron Formations (BIF) | Geology for Investors
After the initial deposition of BIF deposits are often further enriched in iron by either of : supergene enrichment - where weathering saw the leaching of soluble materials; hydrothermal processes. Both of these can result in high-grade hematite (martite) and goethite-rich deposits that can contain 50-68% iron. Largest BIF Deposits
