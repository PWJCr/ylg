## Coal Mining In The 1920's
Coal Mining In The 1920's. Lots of people used to go to West Virginia to work in the mines. Few people visit the mines and have no idea what they are like. Back in the 1940's, I gave a program at the Madison, North Carolina Rotary Club covering how coal was mined around 1920.

## The US Coal Industry in the Nineteenth Century
As a result, coal mining needed larger amounts of capital as new systems of pumping, ventilation, and extraction required the implementation of steam power in mines. By the 1890s, electric cutting machines replaced the blasting method of loosening the coal in some mines, and by 1900 a quarter of American coal was mined using these methods.

## History of coal miners
Pre 1900. Although some deep mining took place as early as the late Tudor period in the North East, and roughly the same time in the Stuart period along the Firth of Forth coast, deep shaft mining in Britain began to develop extensively in the late 18th century, with rapid expansion throughout the 19th century and early 20th century when the industry peaked.

Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.

Before the Industrial Revolution, two types of mines existed: drift mines and bell pits. Both were small-scale coal mines and the coal which came from these type of pits was used locally in homes and local industry. However, as the country started to industrialise itself, more and more coal was needed to fuel steam engines and furnaces.
