Magma that is basalt has a greater tendency to fracture than other type of magma, and it does this when the rate of cooling is slow. The resulting contraction pulls blocks apart from each other polygonally. When this process happens under water, the basalt assumes a distinctive pillow shape, several examples of which lie dotted about the Causeway.
