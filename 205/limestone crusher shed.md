## Limestone Screenings: excellent for grading! Buy online or offline.
Mar 25, 2022If you compact a layer of limestone screening you get a solid surface that sheds water and inhibits the growth of weeds. This material is also suitable as fine aggregate for hot-mix asphalt. Limestone screening is NOT recommended as a base for driveways and roads with heavy traffic. Granular A or Crusher Run is a better choice in this case.
