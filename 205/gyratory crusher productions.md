## Gyratory and Cone Crusher - ScienceDirect
Where the production rate required is in excess of 900 t/h, gyratory crushers are always the preferred option. The primary gyratory crushers operate in open circuit while the last stages, either the secondary or tertiary crushers are invariably configured to operate in closed circuits in series with the primary crusher.

## jaw crusher and gyratory crusher | Henan Deya Machinery Co., Ltd.
The two most common primary crushers used for coarse run-of-mine material are the jaw and gyratory crushers. These primary crushers break rock through compressive forces created by a hard moving surface forcing and squeezing the rocks towards a hard stationary surface. A Jaw Crusher reduces large rocks by dropping them into a flat "V

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

How do a gyratory crusher work? A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher, consisting of a concave surface and a conical head with both the surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel liners. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but it does not rotate. The movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement.
