## Cobalt Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
2.2.6 Cobalt from Central African Copper-Cobalt Ores. While most cobalt (~ 50%) is produced as a coproduct from the processing of nickel/cobalt ores, a significant amount of cobalt (~ 35%) is produced from Central African copper-cobalt ores. The remaining ~ 15% is produced from other primary sources, such as Moroccan cobalt-arsenic ores.
