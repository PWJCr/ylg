## SART Process for Gold Recovery and Cyanide Management : BQE Water
Gold recovery can become uneconomical when cyanide-soluble base metals such as copper and zinc are present in gold ore deposits. These metals form weak acid dissociable (WAD) complexes with the cyanide and preferentially competes for cyanide. The result is high cyanide consumption, poor gold doré purity and high concentrations of copper

Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.
