## Grinding Processes | SpringerLink
Grinding is an essential process in the manufacture of virtually all types of mechanical equipment and cutting tools. For example, the production of rolling element bearings, automotive components, power generation equipment, and computer and electronic components is critically dependent on grinding processes.

## In Grinding, Coolant Application Matters - SME
I use a flow rate based upon the grinding power created during the process, because the more aggressive a cycle is, the more coolant is applied. With conventional abrasive wheels, a flow rate of 2 gpm/hp is effective. For superabrasive wheels, a flow rate close to 1 gpm/hp (3.8 L/min/hp) works well.

The established continuous generating method was used as the base technology for the polish grinding process, which is distinct from the vibratory superfinishing used in many non-automotive applications. Continuous generating grinding is an established process for the hard finishing of gears. Based on a dressable grinding worm, this process has proven itself, both in terms of flexibility and
