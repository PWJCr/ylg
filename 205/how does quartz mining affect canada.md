## How can mining become more environmentally sustainable?
In Canada, mining has one of the highest water recycling rates among the industrial sectors, and between 1996 and 2005 reduced its total water intake by 33%. [5] This drop in water use occurred at the same time as the value of production increased 48%, meaning the water intake per dollar of production (or water-use intensity) has also declined.

## Positive and Negative Effects of Mining
Mining Contributes To Global Warming. Natural resources extracted through mining contribute heavily to global warming. Coal and oil are burned to power cars and our electric grid, releasing dangerous CO2 into the environment. Beyond being fueling these processes, mining itself creates a lot of pollution.

On its own, data mining isn't "good" or "bad." What a company does with the information it gathers is what matters. The process can be used to predict meteorological trends, for example. It can also help companies make decisions that reduce waste or improve efficiencies. Companies can use data mining to detect fraud or to filter out spam.

## How Does Quartz Form? - International Gem Society
Most quartz forms in either igneous rocks or environments with geothermal waters. In igneous rocks, quartz forms as magma cools. Like water turning into ice, silicon dioxide will crystallize as it cools. Slow cooling generally allows the crystals to grow larger. Quartz that grows from silica-rich water forms in a similar way.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.
