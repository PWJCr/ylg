## Galvanized Iron And Steel: Characteristics, Uses And Problems
Introduction. Galvanizing is a process of coating iron or steel with zinc in order to provide greater protection against corrosion for the iron or steel base. The process of galvanizing sheet iron was developed simultaneously in France and England in 1837. Both of these methods employed a "hot dipping" process to coat sheet iron with zinc.
