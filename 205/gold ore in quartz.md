## Do all quartz deposits contain gold? - Quora
Answer (1 of 12): No they do not. Quartz is common, gold is rare. Quartz veins typically form when very hot water rising from depth flows into a shallow crack in the rock. The dissolved silica precipitates as quartz. If there is gold present in the water, it will also precipitate. The result is

For example, the assay value of the fine pulp having been found to be $20.00, and the proportion of coarse gold to each assay ton of pulp 1 milligram or $20.67, then the total value per ton of ore in gold would be equal to $20.00 plus $20.67 or $40.67.

Fortunately, at-home testing isn't hard. You have three basic methods at your disposal: Magnetic Testing- Touch a magnet to the specimen. Pyrite is magnetic, gold isn't. Density- Measure the volume and weight of a gold-bearing stone. Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm.

## Gold mining
Gold-bearing quartz veins in Alaska. Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining. Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning. However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining

## Gold extraction
High-grade gold ore from a quartz vein near Alma, Colorado. The appearance is typical of very good gold-quartz ore. A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes.

Check the tailing piles and waste rock near the entrance of mine openings. Remember that gold miners didn't have metal detectors hundreds of years ago, so it was easy to overlook gold that was peeking out of a piece of quartz. Another interesting thing to consider is that back then it took a lot of gold to be worth the effort to process.
