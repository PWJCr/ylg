grade iron ore to produce quality raw material would play a key role in future which is a fact acknowledged by the iron and steel industry. [1,2] India is bestowed with rich iron ore reserves in the form of hematite and magnetite. Most of the iron ore mines produce hematite ores and have washing plants to produce lumps as well as fines.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
