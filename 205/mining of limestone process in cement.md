The answer is the cement industry. Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture. Limestone is one of the key raw materials of cement clinker. Around 80-90% of the raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.

Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.
