## crushing value test for aggregate for china
METHOD B1 THE DETERMINATION OF THE AGGREGATE, Know More. The aggregate crushing value ACV of an aggregate is the mass of material, expressed as a percentage of the test sample which is crushed finer than a 2,36 mm sieve when a sample of aggregate passing the 13,2 mm and retained on the 9,50 mm sieve is subjected to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load of 400 kN 2 APPARATUS
