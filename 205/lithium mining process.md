## Can lithium mining really be sustainable? - EnergyX | Energy 
Jan 27, 2022The process is long and yields relatively little lithium. Both of these extraction methods can damage local environments and have shown the capacity to have a negative impact far beyond the confines of their mining operation. Acquiring lithium via these processes does not qualify as sustainable - but there are solutions that can turn the tide.

Jun 16, 2021The challenge: Land-based lithium mining is incredibly damaging to the environment, and it wastes huge amounts of water — up to 500,000 gallons of water per ton of lithium extracted. Seawater contains 5,000 times the amount of lithium found on land, but only in very low concentrations, which has made previous attempts to extract lithium from the ocean ineffective.

## How Does Lithium Mining Actually Work and Will We Have Enough?
The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.

North American Lithium suspended production in 2019, sought bankruptcy protection, and was acquired by Sayona Québec in 2021, a joint venture between Sayona Mining (Australia) and Piedmont Lithium (U.S.). The new owners plan to restart the North American Lithium mine, develop other mining projects in Quebec, and build a lithium hydroxide refinery.

## Why Lithium Mining For EV Batteries Should Be Our 'Absolute Last Resort 
May 3, 2022Lithium mining is having a devastating impact on local and indigenous communities as well as ecosystems around the globe, and reducing dependence on automobiles must be a key part of our strategy to curb the damage, a new report says.  and has become a hotbed for a destructive mining process known as brine evaporation,

## Lithium: The Non-Renewable Mineral that Makes Renewable Energy  - Medium
May 22, 2021The problem is that one of the main battery components — lithium — still relies mostly on an energy-intensive mining production process. What exactly is lithium? In its elemental form, lithium

## Lithium Brine Extraction Technologies & Approaches
Under an electrochemical process, lithium ions from a lithium-bearing brine are selectively intercalated into a cathode made from FePO 4 to form a lithium-saturated LiFePO 4. Then,  Saltworks brings water mining expertise and advanced desalination technologies to our lithium clients, offering solutions for concentrating, refining, and
