## Gyratory and Cone Crushers
Gyratory crushers and cone crushers, while looking the same and performing similar duties, are two different machines.A quick look at a machine will allow you to determine if it is a gyratory or a cone In simple terms, if you look at the top of the crusher and it has supporting arms ("spider arms") going out to the centre of the machine (normally 2 or 3) it's a gyratory.

A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones.A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.
