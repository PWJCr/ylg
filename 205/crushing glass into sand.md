## Can you turn glass back into silica?ghtparadox
The chemical process of creating glass is undergone by heating quartz sand, also known as silica sand, to temperatures above 3,090 degrees Fahrenheit until it melts into a clear liquid. Once the sand is in liquid form, it is cooled and undergoes a transformation that doesn't allow it to fully turn to a solid.
