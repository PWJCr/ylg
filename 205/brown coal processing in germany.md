## Coal Processing Methods
Two new methods of gasifying coal have been proposed by Rummel in Germany. Both processes use a slag bath as a heat transfer medium. In the first, a single shaft gasifier, a mixture of coal, oxygen (or air), and steam is tangentially injected into a bath of molten slag.

## Lignite
Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25-35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.

The whopping 3,162 million metric tons of hard coal produced by China dwarfs the output of the second and third-ranked producersâthe U.S. at 932 million metric tons and India at 538 million metric tons.
