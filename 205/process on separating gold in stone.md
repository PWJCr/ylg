## How to Refine Gold: 2 Major Techniques of Gold Refining Process
Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.

The result of this process is 99.5 percent pure gold. The final step is to cast the gold into electrodes or anodes and place them in an electrolytic cell. The refiners will then pass an electric current through the cell. At the end of this process, the gold will be 99.99 percent pure.

## Extracting gold from rock - OpenLearn - Open University
When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

The overwhelming majority of artisanal and small-scale gold miners utilize mercury to separate gold from the unwanted gangue materials (Telmer and Veiga, 2009). Miners use rudimentary tools to mine and process ore, adding elemental mercury to amalgamate ﬁne gold particles after grinding the ore in a ball mill and concentrating by panning.

## Gold extraction
Parting is a process by which gold is purified to a commercially-tradeable standard, typically ≥>99.5%. Removal of silver is of particular interest since the two metals often co-purify. The standard procedure is based on the Miller process. The separation is achieved by passing chlorine gas into a molten alloy.

Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

## How to Separate Precious Metal | DoItYourself
Step 4 - Observe the Gold Separating. Continue to heat the slag until you can observe the molten gold begin to dissolve away from the rest of the slag. This occurs because of the melting point and the density of the gold as compared with the different melting points and densities of the other metal components of the slag. The gold should slip

## The Gravity Separation Methods Used To Process Gold? - Mining-pedia
The commonly used gravity separation methods for gold processing are jigging separation, shaking table dressing and chute ore dressing. 1. Jigging Separation. The working principle of jigging separation is to mix mineral particles with different specific gravity, and stratify them according to specific gravity in the vertically moving variable

## An Overview of Basic Gold Separation Methods
Panning. Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.
