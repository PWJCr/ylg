## How to Calculate Load Carrying Capacity of Conveyor Rollers?
Calculating load on conveyor roller is simple arithmetic and very easy. Assume that you have to design a Gravity Roller Conveyor System for carton box conveying. Weight of the carton box is 50kg Length of the box is 400mm Width of the box is 300mm Lets Calculate width of the rollers = width of the carton box + 50mm So Roller length is 350mm Now we have to decide how many rollers will be below

Belt tension: The belt of the conveyor always experience a tensile load due to the rotation of the electric drive, weight of the conveyed materials, and due to the idlers. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as: Tb = 1.37fLg [2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos (δ)] + (Hg
