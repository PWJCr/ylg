For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 √ó 1.7 = 78 cm.

The crushing ratio of a jaw crusher results from the maximum achievable final fineness in relation to the maximum feed size. For Retsch jaw crushers, this lies between 12.5 and 220. A high value reflects the capacity of a jaw crusher to accept large sample pieces and provide powerful crushing performance, resulting in high final fineness.
