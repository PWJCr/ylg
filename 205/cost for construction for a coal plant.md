## Nuclear Power Cost | Union of Concerned Scientists
The industry has failed to prove that things will be different this time around: soaring, uncertain costs continue to plague nuclear power in the 21st century. Between 2002 and 2008, for example, cost estimates for new nuclear plant construction rose from between $2 billion and $4 billion per unit to $9 billion per unit, according to a 2009 UCS

## New coal power stations are polluting - and expensive
The cost of energy from new coal power stations in Australia is more than double new wind and solar plants with storage. Coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is even more expensive.  The estimated cost of building a coal power station with CCS in Australia in 2017 is upwards of $352/MWh - over eight times the equivalent

They generate about a third of the world's electricity, but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel

For instance, to determine the 'cost' of electricity from a solar power plant you essentially calculate the construction cost, add in a small cost for ongoing maintenance, assume a lifespan of about 30 years and then divided the power to be generated over that timespan by the calculated cost. Cost estimates for coal plants are calculated very

## Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Costs - Semantic Scholar
In fact, the estimated costs of building new coal plants have reached $3,500 per kW, without financing costs, and are still expected to increase further. This would mean a cost of well over $2 billion for a new 600 MW coal plant when financing costs are included. These cost increases have been driven by a worldwide competition for power plant

## Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Costs | Synapse Energy
In 2008, Synapse found that the estimated costs of building new coal plants had reached $3,500 per kW not including financing costs, and that costs were still expected to increase further. These cost increases were driven by a worldwide competition for power plant design and construction resources, commodities, equipment, and manufacturing capacity.
