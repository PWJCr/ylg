Specific reported adverse health effects by people who reside nearby quarry sites include nasal infection, cough, and asthma [13,16]. How deep can a quarry go? Water-filled quarries can be very deep, often 50 ft (15 m) or more, and surprisingly cold, so swimming in quarry lakes is generally not recommended.

Jul 30, 2022I liked the Quarry, and I think it has a good story, but I feel like the bad ending (the one where certain characters can die) makes the game worse. It just cuts of at a weird point, and the credits roll. The thing with Until Dawn was you still got a good ending no mater who died, and the game felt complete.
