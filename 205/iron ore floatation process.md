## Processing Gold Ore by Flotation - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
GOLD RECOVERY BY FLOTATION. A test on a sample, crushed to pass a screen of 120 holes per linear inch, containing $37 gold and 4.8% copper, gave a recovery by flotation alone of 90% of the gold and 98.5% of the copper, but left $8 gold in the tailing. The concentrate carried 44% insoluble matter, which could be reduced by re-treatment.

The flotation process is characterized by the following:  First, the collector is added to the iron ore slurry to selectively coat the iron oxide particles, making the surface hydrophobic. The slurry then goes to a flotation cell, where air bubbles are generated using an impeller and aerator (Figure 1.2.4). At this step, the frother (for

## CNA - Process for preparing floatation catcher of iron ore 
A capturing agent for the floatation of iron is prepared from plant oil, acidified oil, and coarse fatty acid or mixed fatty acids as the intermediate generated in preparing oleic acid through adding concentrated sulfuric acid to them, reaction, adding alkali solution to regulate pH value to 9-11, and adding foamer. Its advantages include high capture power and high selectivity.

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
Several methods/techniques such as jigging, washing, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are being used to enhance the iron percentage in the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content.

## Flotation Process and Techniques Involved in Iron Ore Slurry
There is an option of combining froth flotation with flocculation. 1. Direct floatation technique is the method, at which the mineral sticks to the air bubble and the remaining gangue settles down at the bottom. 2. Reverse floatation technique is the method, at which the gangue sticks to the air bubble and ore particles settle down in the bottom.

With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

## Iron ore beneficiation technology by reverse flotation
The reverse flotation process of iron ore is used in iron ore with complex iron mineral composition and high iron grade. It is mostly used to process coarse concentrates of gravity separation and magnetic separation to obtain high-grade iron ore. There are two types of reverse flotation technology for iron ore, one is anionic collector reverse

## Treatment and Recycling of the Process Water in Iron Ore Flotation of 
Coagulating sedimentation and oxidation treatment of process water in iron ore flotation of Yuanjiacun iron mine had been studied. The process water of this mine carried residual polyacrylamide (PAM), poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), and Ca 2+ from the flotation and caused decrease of the iron flotation recovery or grade of
