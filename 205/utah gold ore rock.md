## Utah's Gold Mining History | WildernessUSA
A few prospectors staked claims, but abandoned their efforts due to the scarcity of water and pannable gold. Attempts to mine gold-bearing minerals also failed, since the gold could not be effectively separated from the rock. Rich deposits of silver ore allowed the mining industry to flourish in the area until the late 1800s.

## Gold Rocks: Is it Real Gold? Gold Ore Identification - Gold Rush Nuggets
Gold ore is probably one of the most commonly misidentified minerals of all. I probably get at least 2 emails every week from someone asking if they have found gold, but 99.9% of the time, the gold rock that they have found is not actually gold. An important thing to understand about most gold ore is that it isn't shiny at all.
