Copper can be extracted, with very small amounts of nickel, at pH 6.0 to 6.5, while nickel is extracted from the copper raffinate at pH 8.0 to 8.2. These pH values refer to the pH of the aqueous phase entering solvent extraction; the corresponding equilibrium pH values are approximately 4.7 (copper) and 6.2 (nickel).
