## Perlite - Gulf Perlite L.L.C.
Perlite is a volcanic rock mined in open-pit quarries. The volcanic glass, or perlite, is formed when lava (molten rock) spews out of a volcano, and cools in a rapid manner. Because of rapid cooling, water is trapped within the rock, and the lava forms into a glass-like structure. Perlite contains 2 to 5 percent water and is a silicate rock

## Expanded Perlite Natural Insulation - Manufacturing for Construction
The mining of perlite ore takes place in open-pit mines located in volcanic areas in different regions of the world. The ore is milled and sifted in different sizes so that it can be transformed later.. The processed ore is calcined at 1000Â°C which causes the water molecules inside to evaporate, exploding and expanding up to 20 times its original volume, producing the expanded perlite.

## Perlite
Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content, typically formed by the hydration of obsidian.It occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently. It is an industrial mineral, suitable "as ceramic flux to lower the sintering temperature", and a commercial product useful for its low density after processing.

What You Need to Know about Expanded Perlite. Perlite is a generic term for naturally-occurring sedimentary rock that contains silicon, aluminum, potassium, sodium and other trace minerals. What sets perlite apart from other volcanic glasses is that when it is heated to its softening range, it expands from four to twenty times its original volume.

7.2.2.1 Perlite. Production, Origin, and General InformationâPerlite is a glassy volcanic rock with a rhyolitic composition and 2%-5% of combined water (Alkan and DÅgan, 1998; DÅgan and Alkan, 2004; Kaufhold et al., 2014 ). The major known global perlite resources (about 70%) are located along the Aegean coast in Turkey.
