The general principle is to spread three tons of volcanic rock dust per acre, which comes to about 1.25 pounds per square yard. In the metric system, this comes up to 750 grams per meter. Therefore, you should plan on about 10 to 15 pounds of rock dust being enough to re-mineralize a hundred square feet of garden space for up to three years.

## Can you use stone dust for pavers?
In general, stone dust is a finer material than sand and can provide a better finished surface. However, sand is more versatile and easier to work with, making it a better choice for some applications. Ultimately, the best material for pavers will depend on the project requirements.

Generally, when the stone ratio is more than the sand, this concrete cures a little stronger than a 1:3:3 ratio. The difference is in the workability of the concrete. The sand tends to make the concrete a little more easier to work with. The less sand the rockier the mix is going to be. Cool things you can make by mixing your own concrete

## Stone Dust Doesn't Belong Under Pavers. Here's Why.
In contrast to stone dust, concrete sand provides superior performance over time. It doesn't eat away at pavers, it affords excellent drainage, and it compacts well. The coarse texture also acts to hold pavers in position, providing a stabilizing buffer that allows the ground underneath to shift without shifting pavers.
