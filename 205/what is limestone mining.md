## Lime in Flotation and Recovery Processes | Graymont
Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores, either run-of-mine, milled, autoclaved or roasted, are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution, keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.

## Limestone Facts
Limestone is a sedimentary rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Because sedimentary rocks are made of various types of sediments, the other 50% of a limestone rock could be virtually any other mineral. Limestone originates in wet areas which mean it could also be composed of shells and waste matter from organisms.

## Lime in the Mining Industry | Graymont
Lime in the Mining Industry. The world's ability to support its population is sustained by the many products provided by the mining and metals industry. Consider a world without advanced manufacturing, agriculture or mass-scale energy production. Virtually all of mankind's needs must be dug from the earth, grown in the soil, or taken from the sea.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock, although it has a hardness of 3-4 Mohs and a density of 2.5 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The rock is primarily composed of calcite or calcium carbonate, with most of these rocks being around 95% calcium carbonate. Being so high in calcium makes limestone rock polish and smooth better.

Oct 13, 2020Mining. Limestone has been a valuable resource since Missouri became a state. In early open pit operations, limestone was mined and crushed by hand and removed from the quarries by mules, carts and tramways. Limestone is now mined using surface and underground methods. Surface quarrying is the most common method of producing limestone in Missouri.
