The mining value chain is the historic bedrock of South Africa's economy. It directly contributes more than 300 billion rand to GDP, directly employs more than 450,000 people, and is the economic anchor of many communities around the country. Unfortunately, much of the news about South African mining in recent years has been negative.

## How does the mining sector impact the South African economy?
Jun 24, 2021Mining contributes 11% of gross capital creation but also 16% of total direct foreign investment in South Africa. Despite accounting for just 0.3 percent of taxpayers, the sector was liable for 6 percent of the tax imposed in 2014. Although quarrying employs about 500,000 people, it accounts for barely 5% of the country's employment.
