## The Pros and Cons of Manufactured Sand - The Screed Scientist®
This can help in reducing the sand mining from river beds. Lesser impurities and good working properties: Manufactured sand is free of silt and clay particles, and has denser particle packing than natural sand. It also offers higher flexural strength, better abrasion resistance, higher unit weight and lower permeability.
