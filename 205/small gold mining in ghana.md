## Gold mining and living standards in Ghanaian households - IGC
Ghana is one of the top 10 producers of gold in the world. The industry is one of the most important Ghanaian exporters and a major contributor to government revenue and foreign direct investment. Despite the success of gold mining at a macro level, there is less clear that it has brought benefits to the local population.

## Galamsey
Galamsey, derived from the phrase "gather them and sell", is a local Ghanaian parlance which means illegal small-scale, gold mining in Ghana. Such workers are known as galamseyers or orpailleurs in neighboring Francophone nations. Galamseyers are people who perform illegal gold mining independent of mining companies, digging small working pits, tunnels, and sluices by hand.
