## Concentration By Gravity Separation - Henan Aluneth Heavy Machinery
Gravity separation process is used for the concentration of haematite. Gravity method is based on the difference between the densities of the ore particle and gangue. It is used for the concentration of denser ores from the water soluble and lighter impurities gangue. Oxide ores and carbonate ores are concentrated by this method.

Solution. a. Electromagnetic separation is generally used to concentrate ore by separating out the particles of non magnetic minerals. b. In smelting the concentrated ores are heated and reduced by using some reducing agent to decompose the ore and driving off other elements as gases and slag, leaving behind the metal only.

## Gravity Separation For Ore Concentration
Gravity separation and Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru. Oct 12, 2018Fig 1 Effect of centrifugal force on gravity force. Separation of the ore particle by gravity is dependent on two factors namely (i) settling rate of the particles, and (ii) difference in specific gravity when compared against the medium in which they are being separated, this gives differential settling rate and has been
