## how to process hematite iron ore
Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral. Iron Furnace: In the 1700s and 1800s, small mines in the eastern United States produced hematite which served as the primary iron ore of the region. The ore was processed by heating it by burning charcoal in simple stone furnaces. The iron ore deposits were small and difficult to exploit

## How To Tell if Hematite Is Real (5 Tips For Beginners)
5. Weigh It. If you're lucky to come across pure hematite you should expect to have it weigh approximately 70% iron and 30% oxygen. But, you'll rarely find it in its pure composition unless if you find it on the sedimentary deposits on the ocean floor. When you weigh it, you should be careful of any additional weight.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
Organic binders have been used as an attractive alternative to bentonite in iron ore pelletizing process, mainly because it burns without leaving any residue in the final pellet.  For this reason, hematite is agglomerated with controlled amounts of carbon (1-2% wt.) that burns during induration, generating the required heat. For both cases

## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

Hematite is often cheaper to process than other forms of iron ore as it generally does not require beneficiation due to its higher iron content. However, hematite ores may contain higher concentrations of contaminant elements (such as phosphorus, alumina and silica) and may therefore need to be blended prior to smelting.
