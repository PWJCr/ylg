## Construction Ergonomics: Major Risks and How to Control for - Safeopedia
May 5, 2021Ergonomics is a science that focuses on designing spaces, workplaces, tasks, and processes to improve well-being and prevent strain and muscular injury. In the context of construction, we can simplify the concept down to fitting the job to the employee rather than forcing the employee to fit to the job. That means avoiding unnecessary uses of

## Identify hazards in the workplace - Sitemate
Step 1 - Identify hazards -. Identify and find things which have the potential to cause harm, these can include: Biological hazards - Bacteria, viruses, animals, other humans. Chemical hazards - Hazards stemming from any hazardous chemical. Ergonomic hazards - Repetitive movements, incorrect posture, incorrect set up of work environment.

Mechanical factors that cause accidents total less than 10% of the number of industrial accidents. These are caused by a number of factors that are reasonably controllable. Mechanical failures that have the potential to cause accidents include: Broken or damaged part - within the engine or machine due to poor quality metal part.

A study found that between 1996 and 2010, 58% of workers experienced significant abnormal hearing loss due to noise. Nearly 80% of welders suffered from hearing loss and 47% of roofers experienced NIHL. The construction industry saw the second highest number of workers exposed to noise hazards (manufacturing was the first).
