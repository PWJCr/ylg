## The gold producing country in Africa
At the time, gold production was so substantial that we could extract more than 1000 tons of gold in a single year. It is a true historical record for South Africa. Compared to the African continent, South Africa is the largest gold producer. Gold production increased by a ton of gold (+ 0.53%) between 2010 and 2011.

## List of countries by gold production
This is a list of countries by gold production in 2018.. Until 2006, South Africa was the world's largest gold producer. In 2007, increasing production from other countries and declining production from South Africa meant that China became the largest producer, although no country has approached the scale of South Africa's period of peak production during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The Consep Acacia Reactor is a complete intense leaching plant that maximises the recovery of gold from gravity concentrates. Often used downstream from FLSmidth Knelson Concentrators, the Acacia produces the optimum solid-liquid interaction for maximised gold leaching kinetics by using an up flow fluidised reactor as opposed to complex mechanical agitation.

Uranium production in South Africa has generally been a by-product of gold or copper mining. In 1951, a company was formed to exploit the uranium-rich slurries from gold mining and in 1967 this function was taken over by Nuclear Fuels Corporation of South Africa (Nufcor), which in 1998 became a subsidiary of AngloGold Ltd, now Anglo Gold Ashanti.

Separation of up to 96% pure gold was achieved which led to an investment boom as larger gold mines were opened up. 1894. Three gold mines established the Rand Mutual Assurance Company, a world pioneer in workmen's compensation. 1898. Gold output soared to 118 tonnes making South Africa the world's leading producer.
