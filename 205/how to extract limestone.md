Be careful though. Acids can 'etch' fossils if too strong. If it starts really bubbling away, you may want to add more water, Acids can attack the fossil preferentially if the limestone has a low cement content or dolomitised. You can avoid etching by coating the fossils in a runny super glue. It will impregnate the fossil and strengthen it.

## Slip casting-expeerts
A dry plaster mold will absorb the water in slip at a fairly uniform rate. You fill a plaster mold with slip, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, pour off the excess, and what remains is a .25" thick shell of clay in the form of your mold. Many, many objects are made using this process, including cups, plates and even toilets.
