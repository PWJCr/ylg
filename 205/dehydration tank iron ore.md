## Iron Ore - Official Terraria Wiki
Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Iron Ore is Lead Ore, which will sometimes replace Iron in a world.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## TEG Dehydration Process | Gas Dehydration System - NiGen
Apr 29, 2021A triethylene glycol (TEG) gas dehydration system is a setup used to eliminate water vapor from newly recovered natural gas. This drying equipment utilizes liquid triethylene glycol as its dehydrating agent to pull out water from a stream of natural gas flowing over it. A major benefit of using a TEG dehydration unit is the ability to recycle
