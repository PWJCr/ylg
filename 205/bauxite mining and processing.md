Potential radiological impacts from mining and processing are mainly due to the radiation associated with radionuclides 232 Th and 238 U and their decay products, and there is a relatively small, essentially negligible, contribution to radiation dose estimates from 40 K in the bauxite. The approximate K chemical concentration of 0.2 wt % in bauxite ore corresponds to a K-40 activity of 0.062

## Physical Bauxite Processing: Crushing and Grinding of Bauxite
Jan 23, 2022To process the bauxite, the bauxite must be mined, crushed, and delivered to the refinery. The first step to reaching the refinery after mining the bauxite is crushing. The crushing circuit is defined by a series of variables and how those variables come together to affect each other. Those variables include the following:
