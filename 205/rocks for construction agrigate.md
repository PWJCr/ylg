## Gravel Calculator
Gravel is a loose mixture of rock fragments formed as a result of erosion. Gravel, along with other types of rock fragments such as sand and crushed stone, is commonly used for construction purposes, though it has other uses as well. Rock fragments are typically classified based on the size of the individual pieces that make up the aggregate.
