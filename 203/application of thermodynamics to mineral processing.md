##  Applications of Process Thermodynamics in Pharmaceutical Coating
Therefore, application of process thermodynamics is limited to conditions after the steady state is reached. Despite these limitations, the process thermodynamics characterization has many uses. Many manufacturing troubleshooting problems relate to instrument failures, which can be pinpointed quickly through the analysis of process thermodynamics.

## Thermodynamics application in technology - The National
Feb 12, 2021Relevance to technology. Thermodynamics is very important in both physics and chemistry fields of study. It developed on a macroscopic scale to take control over its observable properties as energy transfer and extraction. Some areas have been used as the sink for those transfers such as the water bodies as lakes or seas as heat sinks.

## Applications of Thermodynamics in the Study of Mineral Deposits
This paper summarizes the principles of thermodynamics required for an understanding of reaction equilibra in aqueous solutions and outlines the construction of activity diagrams. Making use of the concept of electron activity, the electron is treated as an aqueous species. Mineral stabilities in several types of mineral deposits are portrayed by means of log f02-pH diagrams.
