Jaw crushers are mainly used in primary crushing stages and are rarely used for secondary crushing. As a compression crusher, this type of machine generally produces the coarsest material because it breaks the rock along its natural lines of weakness. Jaw crushers are an excellent primary stage solution to prepare rock for subsequent processing
