## Examples of Balanced Chemical Equations - ThoughtCo
Check Equations to Make Sure They Are Balanced . When you balance a chemical equation, it's always a good idea to check the final equation to make sure it works out. Perform the following check: Add up the numbers of each type of atom. The total number of atoms in a balanced equation will be the same on both sides of the equation.

The balanced equation (formula) that represents cellular respiration is: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + 38 ATP, or: This formula could also be read as: Glucose + oxygen -> water + carbon dioxide + energy. Essentially, this means that in cellular respiration glucose and oxygen are transformed to make water, carbon dioxide, and energy.

## balanced balanced chemical equation for mining gold
balanced balanced chemical equation for mining gold Aqua Regia - MIT. Aqua Regia is a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. It can dissolve gold, which single acids alone cannot do. Here we see that each of the acids separately has no effect on the gold but a mixture of the two dramatically reacts with the gold.
