Flotation plant recovery: a copper flotation plant, fed with Cu-Pb concentrates, produces a copper concentrate and a tail which is subsequently fed to a bulk flotation plant delivering a lead concentrate and a zinc-lead concentrate [14]. The traditional 2-product formula can be used to calculate the recoveries from the raw data.

There are two flotation methods commonly used in the flotation market, direct flotation and reverse flotation.  As the most widely used beneficiation plant, froth flotation can be used for rough processing and cleaning of more than 90% of minerals. Froth flotation can select copper ore, zinc ore, lead ore, and other non-ferrous metals.
