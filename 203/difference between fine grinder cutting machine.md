## The difference between grinding and cutting - ants machine
Compared with grinding, cutting can play a role in high-speed processing when processing softer and easy-to-process materials due to the difference in processing physical effects. In addition, it is relatively suitable for grinding and processing of complex workpiece shapes, and the range of shapes that can be processed is relatively large.
