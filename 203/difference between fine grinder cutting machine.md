## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.

## The difference between grinding and cutting - ants machine
Compared with grinding, cutting can play a role in high-speed processing when processing softer and easy-to-process materials due to the difference in processing physical effects. In addition, it is relatively suitable for grinding and processing of complex workpiece shapes, and the range of shapes that can be processed is relatively large.
