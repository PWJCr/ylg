## CBSE Class 12 : Concentration of Ores, Chemistry - Unacademy
Ores are solid materials that can be used to produce pure metals. Concentration, dressing, or benefaction of ores is extracting undesirable particles from ore. There are various steps to it. The variations in physical characteristics of the existing metal complex and that of the gangue are used to separate the needed material from the ore.

Concentration of the Ore. When an ore has a low percentage of the desired metal, a method of physical concentration must be used before the extraction process begins. In one such method, the ore is crushed and placed in a machine where, by shaking, the heavier particles containing the metal are separated from the lighter rock particles by gravity.

Aug 29, 2022Definition of Concentration of Ore. Ore concentration is the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals in their pure form. In other words, it is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.

## Example of metal oresvital-massagen
Example of metal ores. The maximum mineral ore samples transfer of the metal chelate from aqueous to organic phase occurred within pH 6-8, but for the extraction of uranium in Ore sample (0.3 g) each from 38 834, 38 835, 38 842, 38 849, the presence of iron(III), copper(II), and nickel(II), pH 6 was and 38 850 was transferred to a beaker and hydrochloric acid.

## Gold extraction
Albion process; The refractory ore treatment processes may be preceded by concentration (usually sulphide flotation). Roasting is used to oxidize both the sulphur and organic carbon at high temperatures using air and/or oxygen. Bio-oxidation involves the use of bacteria that promote oxidation reactions in an aqueous environment.
