## allowable wastages for all construction materials
material cost contributes to about 40% of the total construction cost of which cement and steel account for 60% of that cost. Hence it is necessary to curb wastages in this area to have control over the economy of the project cost. It is observed that, 5 -10 percent of construction materials end up as waste on construction sites. It is

## HOW TO CONTROL WASTAGE OF CONCRETE AT SITE? - The Constructor
While estimating quantity of concrete for particular structural work, we normally consider 3-5% as wastage. But wastage of concrete more than that can increase the cost of project and may impact project progress. So, it is necessary to control the concrete wastage at site. Concrete wastage can be prevented by proper planning of pour.
