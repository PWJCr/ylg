## What is No-Fines Concrete? Advantages and Mix Proportion
No-fines concrete, when conventional aggregates are used, may show a density of about 1600 to 1900 kg/m3, but when no-fines concrete is made by using lightweight aggregate, the density may come to about 360 kg/m3. No-fines concrete does not pose any serious problem for compaction. Use of mechanical compaction or vibratory methods are not required.
