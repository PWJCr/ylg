## Coal-oxygen process provides CO/sub 2/ for enhanced recovery
Abstract. A description is given of a process which is based on the production of CO/sub 2/ in electric power plants that burn coal in an O/sub 2/-CO/sub 2/ mixture (not air). The process eliminates the need for flue gas desulfurization and carbon dioxide purification required in more conventional approaches to recovery from flue gases.

Of the three fossil fuels in common use - natural gas, petroleum, and coal - the United States has far more coal than gas and petroleum (compare Figures 7-1, 8-1 and 9-1). This suggests that, when supplies of gas and petroleum become scarce, it would be possible to turn to coal as our major fossil fuel energy resource.

Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Oxy-Fuel Combustion | Southwest Research Institute
Oxy-fuel combustion is a fairly new approach to power generation. The process uses air that is stripped of other elements like argon and nitrogen until it's highly concentrated oxygen. It is then combined with a fuel, usually either coal or natural gas, into a stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) inside a combustor. The fuel and O2 chemically react, and the resulting CO2 and H2O

## How is coal processed? | Socratic
Mine mouth coal for power plants undergoes very little to no processing, while metallurgical or thermal coal for export usually undergoes washing to remove rock particles. Most coal mines that mine coal for power plants simply dig it up and send it to the power plant for burning. Very little processing. Some times a mine might blend low grade coal with higher grade coal to ensure a constant
