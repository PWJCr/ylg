## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

3 days agoSuppose you need to build a crushed limestone driveway for a friend. Her driveway measures 3 meters wide by 10 meters long, and she wants her driveway to have its final layer to be 10 centimeters (0.1 meters) deep of crushed limestone rocks with a density of 2,410 kg/m³.Let's say you want to consider a 10% wastage percentage for this project. Let us now determine how much limestone you need

## When were limestones invented?etta.ca
How many years does it take limestone to form? Limestone stalactites form extremely slowly - usually less than 10cm every thousand years - and radiometric dating has shown that some are over 190,000 years old. Stalactites can also form by a different chemical process when water drips through concrete, and this is much faster.

Spalling is less frequent with limestone than with sedimentary stones which are also less hard. Limestone is hard enough to resist internal forces which would cause spalling in other natural stones or fabricated masonry.

When time is of the essence, buying gold in the form of a 1-kilo gold bar (32.5 ounces of .999 pure gold) can be your fastest route to large-scale gold ownership. Gold bars offer more ounces of gold, for less. You can generally purchase more ounces of gold for less than if you bought the same amount of gold as individual coins.

There are four types of carbonate-based limestone that are available. Calcite is pure calcium carbonate (CaCO 3, 40 percent Ca).Calcitic lime is composed of mostly CaCO 3 (> 30 percent Ca) with some MgCO 3 (<5 percent Mg). Dolomitic lime contains less CaCO 3 (<30 percent Ca) and more MgCO 3 (>5 percent) than calcitic lime.
