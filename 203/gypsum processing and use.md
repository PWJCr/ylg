## Gypsum: an old product with a new use - Iowa State University
Gypsum is a fertilizer product and supplies the crop-available form of calcium (Ca 2 +) and sulfur (SO 4 2-). If these forms are deficient in soil, then crop productivity will benefit if gypsum is applied. This is a big "if" for Iowa soils. Research has not shown deficiency of Ca and normally any potential problem with low Ca levels is taken

2. Gypsum Helps Reclaim Sodic Soils. Gypsum is used in the reclamation of sodic soils (Aldrich and Schoonover 1951). Where the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of sodic soils is too high, it must be decreased for soil improvement and better crop growth. The most economical way is to add gypsum which supplies calcium.

There are five basic stages in gypsum processing: Excavation is sometimes carried out by digging out an area of ground where the gypsum is located using open-cast techniques. To reach deeper deposits drift or shaft mines may be needed. The drilling and digging equipment is applied to dig out the gypsum ore in excavation stages.
