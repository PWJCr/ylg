So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum. No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require. 1.Cement = 6 bags = 300 kgs. 2.Fine Aggregate = 115/0.167 = 689 kg. how many cft of aggregate for 1cum for m20.

## Cement Concrete Calculator - Cement Concrete
2 days agoExample for concrete calculator in Yards, Here, I want to show you a calculation for a 20' by 20' and 3'' thickness concrete slab. 1 . 20×20 = 400 square feet. 2 . 3/12 = 0.25 feet. 3 . 400x 0.25 = 100 cubic feet. 4 . 100 x 0.037 = 3.7 cubic yards. The above example is solving for volume in yards.

## How to Calculate Quantities of Ingredient in 1cum of Nominal Mix Concrete?
1 Bag of Cement = 50 kg. So, number of Cement Bags for 1m 3 of Concrete = 323/50 = 6.45 bags. Method - 2: Generally, 1 cum of cement is approximately 28.8 bags. Weight of cement needed = volume of cement × 28.8. = 0.224 × 28.8 = 6.45. Hence, we require 323 Kg or 6.5 bags of cement for 1m 3 of concrete.
