## Graphite Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart - JXSC
What is Graphite. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6, symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute, flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.

Mining. Graphite ore is mined using excavating machines that carry dump trucks with raw ore. The entire extraction process follows a mining plan, facilitating the selection of the most suitable ore for final products. Homogenisation. The deposition of this ore on the feeding plant is systematised to form feeding piles in layers.

Producing graphite from mineral deposits results in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from the conventional mining process. However, the heat treatment of synthetic graphite is an energy-intensive process that releases harmful emissions. According to one study, the manufacturing of synthetic graphite produces roughly 4.9kg of CO 2 per kg. بیشتر

## Graphite Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Graphite Mining. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6, symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute, flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.

## Project to build $202M graphite processing plant in Alabama kicks off
Apr 19, 2022The $202 million plant, which is being built in the Lake Martin Regional Industrial Park just off U.S. 280 in Coosa County, will process raw graphite into refined, battery-grade graphite for use in batteries that power EVs, electronics and many other products. Once completed, Phase I of the facility near Alexander City is expected to employ at
