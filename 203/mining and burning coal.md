## Boris Johnson says Britain should resume mining and burning coal
Jun 22, 2022Boris Johnson proposed that the UK resume mining and burning its own coal despite a climate emergency. The Prime Minister said it was "meaningless" for Britain to import coal from abroad for use in steelmaking "when there are domestic resources". The UK has significantly abandoned coal for power generation and reduced CO2 emissions, but still

## Effects Of Coal Mining On The Environment - The World Counts
The mining and burning of coal has grown more or less non-stop since the late 1800s. The good news is that this steady rise seems to have been stopped. Global mining of coal is expected to remain steady in the years to come. But this is far from good enough. The rise has stopped but it has stopped at record levels.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground.  In addition to atmospheric pollution, coal burning produces hundreds of millions of tons of solid waste products annually, including fly ash, bottom ash, and flue-gas desulfurization sludge, that contain mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic, and other heavy metals.

Coal still powers the world - around a third of global electricity is coal generated.It's cheap and plentiful, but it comes with a cost. When burnt, it releases more carbon dioxide than oil or gas, so it's a big problem when it comes to climate change.Coal also produces toxic elements like mercury and arsenic, and small particles of soot which contribute to air pollution.

Coal utilization is associated with various forms of air pollution.During the incomplete burning or conversion of coal, many compounds are produced, some of which are carcinogenic.The burning of coal also produces sulfur and nitrogen oxides that react with atmospheric moisture to produce sulfuric and nitric acids—so-called acid rain.In addition, it produces particulate matter (fly ash) that

3. Coal power can create high levels of radiation. A byproduct of burning coal for power, called "coal ash," produces radiation. This ash then settles around the surrounding areas of the coal plant. According to Scientific American, a coal power plant can produce up to 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant.

Coal impacts: water pollution. When you burn charcoal in your grill at home, ash is leftover. The same is true for coal-fired power plants, which produce more than 100 million tons of coal ash every year. More than half of that waste ends up in ponds, lakes, landfills, and other sites where, over time, it can contaminate waterways and drinking water supplies.
