## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

In Adeloye [11], the unit cost of fuel component for cement production is as low as $6 per tonne in China as opposed to $30 per tonne in Nigeria; this has contributed largely to the high and persistent rise in unit cost of ce- ment production. There is thus the need for the adoption of energy efficiency in cement production in Nigeria.

The basis for mixing by volume is usually one part of concrete in n parts of sand and 2 parts of ballast. Ballast is usually double compared to sand. The cement/sand ratio depends on the desired strength of the concrete. The ratio is lower when high strength is required. The volume of a 50 kg bag of cement is 34.5 litres.

## Advantages of Precast Concrete and Factory Production | Quality | Cost 
Factory production enables a specific concrete quality to be achieved. Only through factory production is it possible to produce concrete components with architectural textures and colours, especially for fac¸ade designs.  Lower production costs.

Usually, the cost of the formwork is $1.10 per square foot of the concrete area. This estimate is prepared for a square or rectangular area. The cost of formwork is increased for rounded or contoured concrete. Cost to Finish Concrete: Concrete prices mainly differ on the basis of the type of finishing provided in the design.

## Comparative analysis on costs and benefits of producing natural and 
Dec 1, 2020Nevertheless, the production costs for recycled concrete aggregates were lower than those for the corresponding natural aggregates. For instance, the long-term cost of producing one tonne of fine manufactured aggregate was 49 % higher than that for fine recycled concrete aggregate. Also, the environmental related cost accrued from production of

## A surprising contributor to climate change: concrete
Take China, for example. It has poured more concrete in the past six years than America poured in the past 300. Making concrete takes a ton of energy. As much as 10 percent of global CO2 emissions

## cost of production of concrete
Using a modified genetic algorithm to minimize the production costs for slabs of precast prestressed concrete joists, Having mapped the problem of minimum production cost of slabs with precast prestressed concrete joist into a minimization problem with restrictions, the next step was to solve the minimization problem using,

## Concrete Manufacturing Process in modern construction - CforCivil
The concrete not to pour over a height of 1.5m. As the height of pouring concrete increases, it leads to separation of aggregates and cement paste. It causes segregation of concrete and causes honeycomb. Many concrete placing equipment use in modern construction times. some of the equipment are concrete pumps and boom lifts.
