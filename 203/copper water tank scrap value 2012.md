773. 15 Jan 2012. #4. Last time I checked, scrap copper is approx €4 per kg. A standard 30 gallon copper cylinder is appprox 11kg so cylinder is worth approx €44. Any other bits you have will bump up the price. Also separate the brass fittings as they will be a higher price per kg.

The value of any scrap copper/brass that I will be taking is largely built into my price. Customers tend to assume that you will clear all waste from their home when you have finished. However, I must say that I take all waste, including anything that hasn't any value and costs me to dump. I'm surprised he left this for you to dispose of.

28 January 2008 at 8:19PM. booty40uk Forumite. 514 Posts. Hi Afitos. It most certainly does have a value. Prices for any scrap metal are through the roof at the moment and the last i heard was that scrap copper was fetching £260.00 per cwt. Get it back from them and take it to your local scrap metal dealer.

HI. copper is very valuable secondhand, currently clean cooper (no joints etc on it) is worth about £4 per Kg, and Brassierie copper (with joints and the tank will come into this category) is worth about £2.75 per Kg. Depending on location and amount of copper being removed it could be worth between £50 and £200.

Over the past year the London Metals Exchange price for copper has gone from US$3.50 per pound down to $1.20 and has since recovered to $2.70. Convert these values to Aus$ and the decline and recovery is even more spectacular. However LME prices are basically wholesale prices by the shipload and are not what Sims will pay you.
