## Designing Inclined Screw Conveyors for Industrial Applications
CEMA has developed standard pitches for screw conveyors: full pitch, short (2/3) pitch, and half (1/2) pitch. Full pitch screws are typically used in horizontal screw conveyors because there is no loss in conveying efficiency. As a screw conveyor is inclined, a full pitch screw will lose efficiency due to the angle of the flight. Pitch Efficiency

## Screw Conveyor Overview (Screw Feeder / Auger)
A screw conveyor is made of a housing, typically a tube or a U trough, in which is rotating a screw flight or auger (helical shaped blade) that allows to mechanically move bulk materials. The screw can be shaftless, or having a shaft on which is welded the helical blade. Screw conveyors are a very popular equipment in solids processing industry

The other thing to consider with this flight profile is that capacity is reduced as compared to a similarly sized single flight conveyor by a factor of 1.57x. As an example, a regular flight conveyor may be able to convey 9 tons/hour whereas a cut flight screw would convey 5.7 tons/hour. Cut and fold. This is a slight variation of the cut

Select a screw size. Choose a thickness that works for the width of the material you're placing the screw into, as well as the weight the screw may support. Determine the correct screw length. Choose a length based on the depth of the material you are placing the screw into. Again, factor in the weight of the material the screw may support.

## Developing screw conveyor flight (flat pattern) - Autodesk Community
Developing screw conveyor flight (flat pattern) I have been working on a screw conveyor and, of course, the flights. I was told that using the Coil tool in Inventor would not allow the flight to be unfold as a sheet metal part. After a bit on research online, that seems to be a common problem and many people are drawing the flat pattern separately.
