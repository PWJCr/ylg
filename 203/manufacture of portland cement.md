Manufacture of Portland Cement. Portland cement is simply a mixture of limestone and clay heated in a kiln to 1400 to 1600 degrees centigrade (2550 to 2990 F). Due to the high temperatures and large amounts of materials being used, considerable attention is given to each stage of the production process.

Advantages of Portland Pozzolana Cement. it is an eco-friendly cement as the material used in the manufacture are made of natural recycled waste. It is very fine cement hence very good when used for plastering works. Pozzolano consists of silica material which makes it cheap and hence reduces the cost of the cement making it economical to use.
