Production and Processing. An Electric arc furnace (EAF) produces steel by the melting of recycled steel scrap, using heat generated by an arc, created by a large electric current Lime added (as flux) combine with silicates and oxides to form liquid slag. EAF slag has a lower density than steel and therefore floats on top of the molten steel.

The electric- arc furnace (EAF) is a squat, cylindrical vessel made of heavy steel plates. It has a dish-shaped refractory hearth and three vertical electrodes that reach down through a dome-shaped, removable roof (see figure ). The shell diameter of a 10-, 100-, and 300-ton EAF is approximately 2.5, 6, and 9 metres.

## Electric Arc Furnace, DC Arc Furnace Manufacturers
DC electric arc furnace refers to the electric arc furnace that uses direct current as energy. The same as AC arc furnace, DC electric arc furnace uses the arc generated between the electrode and the furnace charge (or molten pool) to heat, so as to achieve the purpose of melting. It can be used to smelt steel or alloys and non-ferrous metals.

## Electric Arc Furnace Slag as Coarse Recycled Aggregate for Concrete 
Electric arc furnace (EAF) slag is a by-product of steel production in electric arc furnaces. Several studies have tried to demonstrate its suitability in civil engineering application, such as in bituminous mixtures and cement-based materials, due to its good physical, chemical and mineralogical properties. Particularly the re-use as coarse aggregate for concrete production has been shown to
