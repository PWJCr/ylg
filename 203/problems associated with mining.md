## Illegal mining: the problem and possible solutions
Illegal mining is dangerous work and the practice is generally associated with lawlessness. It is standard practice for miners to spend months at a time underground, facing a very real possibility of death.  There are no easy solutions to the problems that arise from illegal mining. Ideally, mining companies must take responsibility to

## Blasting problem associated with strip mining
Abstract. During the past year, the coal mining industry used 1.6 billion pounds or 53 percent of all explosives sold in the United States. Approximately 94 percent of this amount represents the utilization in strip mines of explosives which were not commercially available 20 years ago. The types of explosive products used on the job are not

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. Problems that can be associated with mine drainage include contaminated drinking water, disrupted growth and reproduction of aquatic plants and animals, and the corroding effects of the acid on parts of infrastructures such as bridges.
