## Alternative Raw Material Soures for Cement Production
It therefore becomes imperative to bring down the cost of cement by investigating into alternative source of raw material for cement production and hence this project. From literature, rice husk ash, Ukpo day,& Nsu day contain the basic mineral constituents which limestone has. Rice husk was burnt temperatures of 5000c, 6000c, 7000c, and 8000c.

## Ethiopia: Cement factories contemplate replacing coal with biomass 
Cement factories use imported coal mostly from South Africa to burn the lime stone, a major raw material in cement production. There are about 17 cement factories in Ethiopia which in aggregate spend 220 million dollars on coal imports.

## The Main Raw Material Used in the Production of Calcium Sulphoaluminate 
The production of ferroaluminate cement clinker has wider technical requirements for clay. Not only the content of alumina can be reduced by 5%, but also the content of Fe2O3 can be more than 5%. This shows that the lower grade bauxite can be used in the production of ferroaluminate cement, and the ferro-bauxite can also be used.

## Production of Sustainable Concrete by Using Challenging Environmentally 
Sep 23, 2021The production of cement involves the consumption of large quantities of raw materials, energy, and heat. Cement production also results in the release of a significant amount of solid waste materials and gaseous emissions. The cement manufacturing industry is currently under greater scrutiny because of the large volumes of CO 2 emitted.

## Assessment on Cement Production Practice and Potential Cement  - IISTE
Some of the fundamental elements to be considered in cement production investment are: A. Cost of Production The cement industry is one of the highest energy-intensive industries in the world, with fuel and energy costs typically representing 30-40 % of total production costs. Raw material costs represent the second-largest

## Raw materials - Understanding Cement
The most common raw rock types used in cement production are: Limestone (supplies the bulk of the lime) Clay, marl or shale (supplies the bulk of the silica, alumina and ferric oxide) Other supplementary materials such as sand, fly ash/pulverised fuel ash (PFA), or ironstone to achieve the desired bulk composition.
