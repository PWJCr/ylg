The nonmetals or non-metals are a group of elements located on the right side of the periodic table (except for hydrogen, which is on the top left). These elements are distinctive in that they typically have low melting and boiling points, don't conduct heat or electricity very well, and tend to have high ionization energies and electronegativity values.
