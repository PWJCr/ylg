## Why Gypsum Works in Your Soil: Part 6 Other Factors
Gypsum reduces phosphorus in runoff from fields. Not only does the use of gypsum reduce the amount of runoff from fields, it also reduces the amount of phosphorus in the runoff water. This is because calcium from gypsum will react with the phosphorus to reduce the amount of dissolved reactive phosphorus in the water.

The real reason why Gypsum is a valuable soil amendment in southwestern soils is that it is used successfully to reclaim a high sodium (sodic) soil condition. Many of our soils have high amounts of sodium in them, and much of our irrigation water can be high in sodium. Both of these conditions often lead to a sodic soil condition.
