## Difference Between Single & Double Toggle Jaw Crusher
A double toggle jaw crusher is much larger, heavier, more moving parts and lower throughput than modern single toggle jaw crushers.The lower throughput statement is a bit misleading because it's partially attributed to the type of bearings they have versus modern crushers, so if one was to upgrade the bearings, throughput could be closer to that of a modern jaw.
