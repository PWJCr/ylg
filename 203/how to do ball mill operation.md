Jul 4, 2022The ball mill is used for the grinding of a wide range of materials, including coal, pigments, and felspar for pottery, and it copes with feed up to about 50 mm in size. The efficiency of grinding increases with the hold-up in the mill, until the voids between the balls are filled. Further increase in the quantity then lowers the efficiency.

Mixed mode - the rolling the grinding balls when part of the grinding balls move in a circular trajectory with further fall. Waterfall - the grinding balls move along a circular trajectory and change it further under gravity.

## Choose right speed to improve ball mill grinding efficiency
Ball mills generally work in a "dropped" state. There are many working speeds to achieve this working state, but there must be the most favorable working speed. In order for the ball mill to perform normal grinding operations, its working speed must be less than the critical speed. Ball mills generally work in a "dropped" state.

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T
