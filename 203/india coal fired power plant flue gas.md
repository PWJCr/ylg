## Deadline for Coal-Based Power Plants to Meet Emission Standards 
Sep 8, 2022The deadline for thermal power plants to install Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) units that cut sulfur dioxide emissions has already been moved many times.  Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, for a typical coal-fired thermal power plant, FGD can remove between 50% and 99.8% of SO2 in flue gases depending upon the age of the plant
