This Mine Of Mine. Middle school students explore the formation, geology, recovery, and uses of coal, as well as the reclamation of coal mine sites. Using sand, clay, soil and rocks, students build a miniature plot of land containing coal deposits. Students then learn about surface mining, and practice the method on a plot of land.

## Effects of surface coal mining and land reclamation on soil properties 
Coal mining often causes drastic changes in the soil profile and the loss of soil organic carbon and nutrient pools ( Indorante et al., 1981 ). As a direct result the soil system can suffer substantial and long-lasting damage, which negatively affects land productivity and ecosystem functionality ( Hartmann et al., 2014 ).

Surface Mines. A surface mine removes coal from excavated surface pits. The mining sequence includes vegetation removal, topsoil removal and storage, overburden removal, and coal extraction. After coal is removed, open pits are backfilled and regraded to approximate original contour, topsoil is replaced, and vegetation reestablished.

Many coal-producing states' budgets are already under stress as coal revenue declines. The distress would only be compounded by having to pay to clean up massive strip mines: the total dollar amount for all reclamation bonds for coal mines in these states is just over $3.9 billion. The largest mines carry bonds in excess of $400 million.

Only companies with a reclamation certificate can close their projects and end their surface leases. Partial reclamation certificates can be issued for portions of a coal mine or coal processing plant to support progressive, timely reclamation.
