Most of the mines in the Cobalt area did not contain many open vugs where proustite, wire silver and other rare silver minerals could form. According to Sergiades, 1968, pg. 428, "Pre-glacial weathering on part of the Woods vein extends to 480' depth; ore deposition in consequence is partly secondary and the vein vuggy."

Cobalt is mined across the world and the vast majority is produced as a by-product from large scale copper and nickel mines. Cobalt is only extracted alone in Morocco and some Canadian arsenide ores.  There are approximately 30 principal cobalt-bearing minerals and over 100 more which contain minor amounts of the metal or include cobalt as a

Feb 18, 2021The ores like cobaltite, erythrite, glaucodot, and skutterudite are the major minerals of cobalt.

Cobalt Ores. Nearly all cobalt is found associated with ores of copper, nickel, or copper-nickel. In the copper-cobalt ore bodies of central Africa and Russia, cobalt occurs as sulfides (carrollite, linnaeite, or siegenite), the oxide minerals heterogenite (hydrated cobalt oxide) and asbolite (a mixture of manganese and cobalt oxides), and the carbonate sphaerocobaltite.

These deposits are primarily worked for copper with cobalt as a by-product. They account for over 50% of world cobalt mined production. Major deposits are characterized by ore minerals contained within organic-rich pyritic shales and sandstones deposited in a near-shore lagoonal environment, under reducing conditions.

cobalt compared to major metals such as copper, nickel, iron and zinc; which is fortuitous since in nature cobalt occurs in relatively minor quantities in association with ores of other metals - predominantly copper, nickel and silver/arsenic. Hence cobalt is seldom mined solely in its own right and its recovery is usually viewed as a by-product.

## Cobalt extraction
Recovery from copper-cobalt sulfide concentrates. The ores are treated by a sulfatizing roast in a fluidized bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble sulfates and iron into insoluble hematite.The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte.Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step to maintain the acid balance

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Geometallurgy of cobalt ores: A review - ScienceDirect
Jan 1, 2021Geometallurgical properties of cobalt ores and minerals. Mineralogy is the principal, and possibly most important, geometallurgical ore property which drives the strategy adopted during ore processing (e.g. leaching versus flotation, leaching agent, flotation collector, etc.). Although styles of mineralisation vary from one type of deposit to

## Mineral Resource of the Month: Cobalt - EARTH Magazine
Medieval miners thought that kobolds poisoned their ores, but the real culprits were the arsenic-bearing cobalt minerals cobaltite and smaltite. Cobalt oxide has been used to make blue glass since ancient times. Cobalt has the highest curie temperature of all metals — it maintains its magnetic properties at temperatures as high as 1121

## cobalt processing | Uses, Supply, & Facts | Britannica
In the copper-cobalt ore bodies of central Africa and Russia, cobalt occurs as sulfides (carrollite, linnaeite, or siegenite), the oxide minerals heterogenite (hydrated cobalt oxide) and asbolite (a mixture of manganese and cobalt oxides), and the carbonate sphaerocobaltite. In the copper-nickel-iron sulfide mines of Canada, Australia, Russia
