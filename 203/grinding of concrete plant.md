##  RPMTAG Chapter 5 - Diamond Grinding and Grooving
Diamond grinding is one of the most cost effective concrete pavement restoration (CPR) techniques. It consists of "grinding" 3/16 to 1/4 inch (5 to 7 mm) of the surface of jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) using closely spaced diamond saw blades. The result is a level, smooth, and generally quieter riding surface.

Once you begin grinding, you must keep the concrete grinder moving regardless of the type of grinder you are using. This will prevent uneven areas or low spots that will require leveling afterward. Make multiple passes with smooth, even motions. If you're grinding a high spot, you should mark the diameter and draw a circle around the area.

## Concrete Grinding and Polishing: Benefits & Applications
Polished concrete floors hold up well, even in high traffic areas, as they will not stain, chip, or discolor. Concrete grinding and polishing also eliminates the need for messy waxing or frequent resurfacing. Low Maintenance: Grinding and polishing concrete floors creates a durable surface, which is much longer lasting than other surfaces

## A Greenhouse Study of Concrete Grinding Residue  - SpringerLink
Concrete grinding residue (CGR) is a byproduct of diamond grinding, a road surface maintenance technique. Direct deposition of CGR along roadsides may influence plant growth, which has not been fully studied. Particularly, systematic experiments of CGR effects on selected common prairie species growth under controlled environments are rarely reported. Thus, in this study, a greenhouse

## Which is best? Concrete Grinding vs. Replacement vs. Leveling
5 days agoHere are some of the advantages and disadvantages of grinding down your concrete: Pros. Cons. Can be a good temporary solution before replacement. Exposes concrete to worse freeze-thaw cycles. A good last-resort if other methods aren't a good fit. Makes the concrete thinner, weaker, and prone to breakage or crumbling.
