## The ball mill - Chemical Engineering - Beyond Discovery
Jul 4, 2022The ball mill is used for the grinding of a wide range of materials, including coal, pigments, and felspar for pottery, and it copes with feed up to about 50 mm in size. The efficiency of grinding increases with the hold-up in the mill, until the voids between the balls are filled. Further increase in the quantity then lowers the efficiency.

A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium

Ball Mill PINION SHAFT BEARINGS. The first part of the mill that we will look at is the TRUNNION BEARING. This is a HYDROSTATIC BEARING which is a slow moving bearing that carries a heavy load. Usually it is constructed from Babbitt's metal. If you happen to remember the introduction to this course Issac Babbitt was the man who devised the
