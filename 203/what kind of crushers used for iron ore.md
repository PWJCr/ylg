## Challenges and opportunities in the iron ore crusher market
For high-hardness iron ore, a cone crusher can be used for the secondary crushing equipment. The HXJQ short-headed cone crusher can achieve a fine crushing effect of 3 to 13mm, which can fully meet the requirements of dry selection and grinding. However, due to the high hardness of such iron ore, the impact on the wear parts is large, so
