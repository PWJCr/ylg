Graphite is naturally floatable due to its hydrophobic property and also soft and smears on other gangue particles, rendering the gangue more or less floatable too. Due to this reason it is important to concentrate on areas such as suitable flotation reagents, depression agents, pH modifiers, and particle size to be fed during the process.

Graphite flotation does not effect tensile poperties. It can reduce fatigue resistance marginally but i doubt it would cause a failure there maybe other factors that have caused this. If it has then your design criteria is too tight. This should be reviewed and fully investigated and understood. The main problem with graphite flotation is a

## Graphite flotation
Graphite flotation. Graphite diffusing from cast iron melts rising to the top of the melt. In metallographic specimen floating graphite is very clearly identifiable even with low degree of magnification. At broken or machined surfaces, the diffused and floated spherolites can be identified as dark spots even with the unaided eye ( Figures 1 to 3 ).

by flotation technique. The petrography studies indicate that the ore primarily consists of quartz and graphite with minor quantity of mica. It analyzed 89.89% ash and 8.59% fixed carbon. The ore was crushed in stages followed by primary coarse wet grinding to 212 µm (d80). Rougher flotation was carried out in Denver flotation cell to eliminate

Flake graphite ore is characterized by scaly or leaf-like graphite, ore grade is not high, generally 3% to 5%, the maximum not more than 20% to 25%. This type of graphite floatability is good, the flotation, the grade up to 90% or more, so the ore grade 2% to 3% can be mined. Flake graphite performance, generally used in the manufacture of
