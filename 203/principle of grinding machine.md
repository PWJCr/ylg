Grinding is the only way the tiny silicon wafers used in computers and cell phones can be made. Even the lawnmowers and axes we use in our yards are ground. The world without grinding would be a different world, indeed. Machines used to grind in manufacturing are called grinders, or grinding machines. Both terms refer to the same device.

## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high
