Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals. It is also called shaft sinking. It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron, coal, etc. which can be found at the depth of the earth's surface. It is found mostly all over the world.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Iron ore extraction techniques - ScienceDirect
Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed, so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as "dogger") allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting. However, he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip, this

Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.
