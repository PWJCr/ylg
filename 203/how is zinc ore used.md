## Production India
Rarely is the ore, as mined, rich enough to be used directly by smelters; it needs to be concentrated. Zinc ores contain 5-15% zinc. To concentrate the ore it is first crushed and then ground to enable optimal separation from the other minerals. Typically, a zinc concentrate contains about 55% of zinc with some copper, lead and iron.

## The Properties and Uses of Zinc Metal - ThoughtCo
Zinc (Zn) is an abundant metal, found in the Earth's crust, with a myriad of industrial and biological uses. At room temperature, zinc is brittle and blue-white in color, but it can be polished to a bright finish. A base metal, zinc is primarily used to galvanize steel, a process that protects the metal against unwanted corrosion.
