## Marble And Its Impact On The Environment
Marble is extracted and not created. It can be cut in any way and installed in a number of places within the home. But there are limited chemicals and energy needed to prep and prepare marble for a home. There are some materials that are completely manufactured, making a larger impact on the environment. But marble does not rely heavily on

In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

Sep 29, 2020This article outlines a technique for the investigation of two geological reference materials for sandstone (GSR-4) and granite (GSR-1) for its rare earth elements such as Dy, Ce, Eu, Er, Ho, Gd, Lu, La, Pr, Sm, Yb, and Nd. This was achieved through the use of high-resolution Array ICP-OES on a PlasmaQuant 9100 Elite supplied with HF Kit.

5.2 Chemical Weathering. Chemical weathering results from chemical changes to minerals that become unstable when they are exposed to surface conditions. The kinds of changes that take place are highly specific to the mineral and the environmental conditions. Some minerals, like quartz, are virtually unaffected by chemical weathering, while

Granite. Granite is the most widespread of igneous rocks, underlying much of the continental crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock. Intrusive rocks form from molten material (magma) that flows and solidifies underground, where magma cools slowly. Eventually, the overlying rocks are removed, exposing the granite.
