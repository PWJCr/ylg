##  Traditional Building Materials as a Sustainable Resource and Material 
conventionally processed construction materials such as steel and Portland cement. The desire generated for these materials has a negative impact, leading to reduced value and perceived inappropriateness of locally available materials. Ideally, building materials for low-cost housing should be produced from locally available raw materials.
