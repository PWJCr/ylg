## Africa's Iron Origins: Archeological Evidence
Archeologists once thought that knowledge of making iron had arrived in northern Africa by the first millennium BCE, later spreading to the south, but more recent research has pushed the advent of iron production farther back in time. Most contemporary scholars believe that Africans began smelting iron from local ores about 2,500 years ago, but

## How green primary iron production in South Africa could help global 
The production of iron and steel is one of the largest global sources of industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. South Africa could competitively export near-zero embodied GHG primary iron to steelmakers in leading decarbonising markets. A green primary iron production process substitutes hydrogen for coke as the iron ore reductant.
