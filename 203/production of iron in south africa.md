## Africa's Iron Origins: Archeological Evidence
Archeologists once thought that knowledge of making iron had arrived in northern Africa by the first millennium BCE, later spreading to the south, but more recent research has pushed the advent of iron production farther back in time. Most contemporary scholars believe that Africans began smelting iron from local ores about 2,500 years ago, but

##  South African Iron and Steel Industrial Evolution: an Industrial 
Union of South Africa in 1910. 2.1 Iron and steel production: Before the Anglo-Boer War The demand for iron and steel increased in the 1880s due to the expansion of gold mines on the West Rand [9] and of the Kimberley diamond mines [10]. The immediate reaction of iron merchants was to import steel from Europe. The South African Coal and Iron

## How green primary iron production in South Africa could help global 
The production of iron and steel is one of the largest global sources of industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. South Africa could competitively export near-zero embodied GHG primary iron to steelmakers in leading decarbonising markets. A green primary iron production process substitutes hydrogen for coke as the iron ore reductant.
