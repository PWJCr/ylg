Methods of cement manufacturing 1- Wet process ___ grinding and mixing of the raw materials in the existence of water. 2- Dry process ___ grinding and mixing of the raw materials in their dry state. The process to be chosen, depend onthe nature of the used raw materials.

Evolution of the cement Process • Wet process easiest to control chemistry & better for moist raw materials. • Wet process high fuel requirements - fuel needed to evaporate 30+% slurry water. • Dry process kilns less fuel requirements • Preheater/Precalciner further enhance fuel efficiency & allow for high production rates. 17.

## Cement Kilns: Dry and semi-dry process kilns
In the subsequent half century, efficient dry process kilns have almost completely displaced slurry-fed kilns. The pioneering was done by Blue Circle, who had eight dry process kilns in operation before the start-up of Tunnel's Padeswood A3 in 1966. The types of dry process kilns fall roughly into four categories: Long dry kilns. Lepol kilns.

## Dry And Wet Process Of Cement Manufacturing
basic methods to produce cement are the wet and dry manufacturing processes. The main difference between wet and dry process is the mix preparation method prior to burning clinker in the kiln. In the wet process water is added to the raw materials to form a raw thick slurry whereas the dry process.
