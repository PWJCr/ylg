## FGD Gypsum and Sustainability - Gypsum Association
The gypsum industry purchases FGD gypsum from electric utilities who employ a washing and purification process to make FGD materials into an FGD gypsum product. Natural gypsum and FGD gypsum have the same chemical composition; they are each calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H 2 O). Today, almost half of all gypsum used in the manufacture of

The government of Quebec (Canada) is trying to find a useful outlet for the mixed waste glass pilling up in its landfills. One solution to consider is the use of fine glass powder from mixed waste glass as alternative cementitious materials (ACM) in concrete, using an open-loop circular-economy principle.

## Desulfurization gypsum uses and properties - take it as cement retarder
The desulfurization gypsum in thermal power plants is mainly produced by the limestone-gypsum wet desulfurization process. The method uses limestone as a desulfurizing agent, and sprays the absorbent slurry into the tower to fully contact and mix with the flue gas, thereby washing the flue gas, then the SO 2 (in the flue gas) reacts with the
