## How Limestone Is Extracted at Vetter Stone
The actual extraction of limestone is made by separating the rock in quarry ledges and dividing it into blocks. Here is an overview of Vetter's Stones extraction process: The overburden, or the material above the stone that is set to be harvested, is lightly blasted and removed. The majority of that debris (backfill) is temporarily removed

## What is Quarrying?
Quarrying is the process of removing rock, sand, gravel or other minerals from the ground in order to use them to produce materials for construction or other uses. So, a quarry is any such working on the surface of the earth where minerals are extracted. Quarries are also known by other names around the world: 'surface mine', 'pit', 'open

## Quarry
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.). There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types ( mines and caves). For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries.
