## Principle Of Electromagnetic Feeder
Electromagnetic vibrating feeder uses the resonance principle of mechanical vibration and the double plastids work in the below critical and resonance state. The materials inside the material chute are continuously thrown up during the feeding process and move forwards along the track of a parabola.
