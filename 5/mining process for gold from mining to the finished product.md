this mining operation. The process is currently unprofitable with a gold price around $300 per ounce. Process Description Unit 100 - Size Reduction of Ore The BFD of the overall process is shown in Figure 1. The PFD for Unit 100, shown in Figure 2, is designed to reduce 41.5 tons/hr of gold ore from a feed range of 2-5" to 160 microns.

## Gold Mining Process
Nov 1, 2021Miners use heavy mining machinery to drill wide steps known as benches, which separate the rock containing gold (ore) from the rock with no economic quantities of gold (waste). Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles.

In other words, 1 ton of ore is only .0005% gold. So really, gold mining is much more complex than digging up nuggets and melting them down. Gold ore must be carefully refined to get every molecule of the precious metal. The process for most mines involves tons of heavy machinery, water, electricity, chemicals, crucibles, and more.

## An Overview of the Five Stages of Gold Mining - MiningNewsWire
Jul 22, 2021To a casual observer, mining gold seems simple: find ore, extract it then process it into gold. However, this isn't the case since mining for gold is a more complex process which occurs in stages.. Before the precious metal can be extracted, firms are required to explore the area in order to accurately determine the size of the deposit and how the ore can be extracted and processed
