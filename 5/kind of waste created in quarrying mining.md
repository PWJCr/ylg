Since alumino-silicate minerals are the most abundant in the Earth's crust, most mining wastes are likely to be of this kind. Therefore alumino-silicate wastes might become sources of geopolymerization. This chapter analyses the utilization of mining wastes to produce geopolymeric binders.

This process is also referred to as selective mining as miners have to choose what to keep and what to discard. In quarrying the target substance is the very rock itself. This can be broken down and processed in various ways, such as to make gravel for example. Little waste is created as everything is processed and used.

Mining also generates a disturbed landscape, unfortunately one that many consider waste until reclaimed by human beings. The development of mining provides an economic base and use of a natural resource to improve the quality of human life.

What is the difference between a mine and a quarry? A quarry is the name for a place where rock is taken from the ground. It is always above ground. A mine can be below ground or at ground level and is where ore is taken from the ground. Marble is quarried, coal is mined.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

## Quarry Mining, Open-Pit Mining, Strip Mining, Mining Techniques 
In other words a quarry is a big man-made hole in the ground from where minerals or rock are taken out. Quarries are made when big deposits of commercially helpful minerals or rock are found close to the Earth's surface. Quarrying is a type of mining and is also called as open pit mining or strip mining.
