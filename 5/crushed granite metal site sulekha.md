Crushed Granite. Crushed granite is unlike other paver options in the fact that it is a loose material. It's a natural stone aggregate that is made up of solid granite that has been crushed down to a variety of sizes for use in landscaping projects. Crushed granite can be used in driveways, pathways, patios, and mixed into garden beds.

## Crushed Granite | Bonsai Nut
Granite when crushed has a very coarse texture, which in turn, greatly increases surface area. This allows more molecules of water to adhere (due to the cohesive properties of water). So, while I agree that it is heavy, it can be SLIGHTLY more useful than smoother rock. Not that I think the plants gain or suffer much from its presence.
