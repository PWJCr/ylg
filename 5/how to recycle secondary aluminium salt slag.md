Aluminium Smelting Australia is the world's sixth largest producer of aluminium and has 4 operating smelters.  Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, charcoal, and coal.
