## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

## How to make calcium carbonate - clam mineral
Calcium carbonate can produce from the marble. You can make calcium carbonate from by crossing the CO2 from the calcium hydroxide. We can make this material by the mixing of the baking soda with acid boric. These are the ways that you can make calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is going to turn into the lime by losing CO2.

## How to Make Calcium Carbide! - Instructables
for this project you will need. chipped lime. crushed charcoal. a carbon rod. a welder. when makeing carbide you dont want to use powdered lime as it will blow out of the furnes, you need some thing thats denser. your charcoal also should not be too fine or it will be blown out too. you will also need a steel crucible to melt the lime in.
