The usual range is between 9.5mm and 37.5mm in diameter. Fine aggregates are usually sand or crushed stone that are less than 9.55mm in diameter. Typically the most common size of aggregate used in construction is 20mm. A larger size, 40mm, is more common in mass concrete. Larger aggregate diameters reduce the quantity of cement and water needed.
