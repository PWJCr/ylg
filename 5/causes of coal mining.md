## Causes of coal mine explosions | Peyton Law Firm, P.L.L.C.
Coal mine explosions are generally caused by either methane or coal dust. Methane gas is a byproduct of coal. It can build up over time in coal mines when there are not enough other types of gases to dilute it to prevent an explosion. Air can explode when it contains 5 to 15 percent methane. Explosions happen when the methane comes in contact

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

A coal-seam fire is a burning of an outcrop or underground coal seam.Most coal-seam fires exhibit smouldering combustion, particularly underground coal-seam fires, because of limited atmospheric oxygen availability. Coal-seam fire instances on Earth date back several million years. Due to thermal insulation and the avoidance of rain/snow extinguishment by the crust, underground coal-seam fires

The pressure wave or wind forces created by a small methane explosion can scour the mine entry, blowing coal dust up into the air. Once this dust is ignited, a chain reaction effect can occur and flame propagation can continue to spread over long distances consuming available fuel and oxygen and generating large volumes of toxic gases.
