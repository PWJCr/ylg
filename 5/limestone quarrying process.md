for quarrying limestone, which is processed in an cement factory located at the bottom of the quarry. The limestone is extracted in platforms 20 m high and 20 m wide with near vertical slopes. A coversoil layer, with high clay and stone content, and about 1 m depth, derived from the mar1 quarry spoil, was added to the bare rock in each platform.

How is limestone extracted? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
