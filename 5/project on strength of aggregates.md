Fine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles passing through a 9.5mm sieve. Fine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles passing through a 3/8-inch sieve. Fine aggregate is natural sand which has been washed and sieved to remove particles larger than. 4.75 mm.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Mechanical Properties of Aggregate. Concrete, in general, is a concoction of cement, aggregates and water. Each of these components accounts for a particular purpose or target. However, the liability of imparting strength and durability to concrete rests on aggregates, the coarse ones in particular. This is owing to the fact that aggregates

Today it requires an estimated 38,000 tons of aggregates to create a mile of a lane for an interstate highway. When it comes to the construction of homes, a home today requires roughly 400 tons of aggregate.

## Crushed Concrete Aggregates - Properties and Uses of Recycled 
By and large, strength of concrete produced from crushed concrete aggregate is lower than concrete made using natural aggregate. Strength reduction of concrete produced from recycled coarse aggregate and natural fine aggregate ranges from 5 to 24%. This influenced by strength of crushed concrete, water to cement ratio of crushed and new concrete.

Aggregates shape and size has a strong influence on properties of concrete. Rough surface textured particles increase the compressive strength of concrete up to 20-30%, instead of using natural gravels that is obtained from river beds. Rough surface have pores which have ability to form bond or create resistance against the applied load.

## Experimental study on strength properties of concrete using brick 
The present paper aims with the study of strength properties of concrete using brick aggregates. To use over-burnt bricks, normal burnt brick as replacement to conventional normal aggregate in different proportions. Brick aggregates can fully or partly replace the conventional coarse aggregate to produce M20 concrete.

## Aggregate: Mechanical Properties of Aggregate | Concrete Technology
ADVERTISEMENTS: Several mechanical properties of aggregate are of interest for the manufacture of concrete, specially high strength concrete subjected to high wear. Some of them are discussed here in brief: 1. Toughness 2. Hardness 3. Specific Gravity 4. Porosity of Aggregate 5. Bulking of Sand. Property # 1. Toughness: It is defined as the resistance [.]
