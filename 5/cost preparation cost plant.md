## How Much Would A Coal Preparation Plant Cost
Coal Processing Plant Cost. an engineering economic analysis of coal preparation plant . if we assume that such a coal has a cost of 20 per ton to the preparation plant operator then the fuel cost per ton of dried coal would be 6 tons hr x 20 ton 0 343 ton 350 ton hr if this particular plant was producing an additional 550 tons per hour of clean coal for a total output at 900 tph then the fuel
