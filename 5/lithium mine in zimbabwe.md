Zimbabwe already ranks as the fifth largest producer of lithium concentrate, albeit from a single mine. Bikita Minerals, in the south of the country, has been in production for more than 50 years, producing lithium feedstock, mostly for the ceramics industry. Now, with worldwide demand for lithium at an all-time high, others are looking to get in.

## Zerttew explores for lithium in Zimbabwe, aims to establish battery 
Zimbabwe is not new to lithium mining -- it exported 1,200 mt of lithium concentrate in 2021, Garacho told S&P Global. "Zimbabwe has historically been mining lithium for the past 50 years and it's only now that the world is gravitating to alternative solutions for batteries, lithium included," he said.

## Countries with lithium reserves in africa
Recent estimates from lithium experts at Roskill has estimated that the marginal costs of producing refined lithium of both carbonate and hydroxide would range between $6,000-$8,000/t through to 2036. This might explain why only a few countries have. Meanwhile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile dominate global lithium reserves, with 56% of identified lithium resources in what the U.S. Geological
