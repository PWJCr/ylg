## Socio-economic and environmental impacts of the iron ore resource tax 
Oct 1, 2020An iron ore resource tax module was introduced in the CGE model. • The socioeconomic and environmental effects of resource tax policies were assessed. • A lower ad valorem tax rate can better achieve tax reform targets. • A carbon tax should be considered to alleviate negative environmental impact.

## Environmental Impacts of Mining - The World Counts
The environmental impacts from mining include: Destruction of natural habitat. Oil, fuel and chemicals spills contaminating surrounding soil, rivers and groundwater resources. Air pollution from mining processing operations. Drainage and runoff from mining sites, including acid mine drainage. Acid mine drainage can go on for thousands of years.

All these different effects add up to serious on-site habitat damage. Mining also creates knock-on effects — like water pollution, air pollution and vegetation loss as a result of soil eruption. This can lead to greater habitat loss beyond the immediate location. Habitat Destruction Caused By Mining.

The main ingredient in the production of steel is iron ore mined from Earth. Over 2,000 million tons of iron ore is mined mined a year - about 95 percent is used by the steel industry. Iron ore is the world's third most produced commodity by volume - after crude oil and coal - and the second most traded commodity - only beaten by crude oil.

## Environmental impact of iron ore mining explained
Common methods of extracting the iron ore consist of blasting, drilling, or general excavating, Most iron ore is produced from open-pit mines. After the iron ore is out of the ground, it may be shipped to the iron and steel manufacturing plant. If the ore contains less than 60 percent iron, it is usually beneficiated to an iron-ore concentrate

What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.
