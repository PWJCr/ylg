## Control a conveyor belt using an inverter | Arduino based PLC 
In this project we describe a model to control an asynchronous motor using a frequency inverter in one of our PLCs based on Arduino. It has been used an MDuino 42 I / Os PLUS and a frequency inverter. An Industrial Shields Panel PC has also been used to manually monitor and control the speed of the conveyor belt and make it more intuitive.

## Calculate the Speed of Conveyor. - Automation & Control Engineering Forum
The way to accurately find the speed of a conveyor is to measure the length then time it for 1 or several rotations. Make a mark "Start" on the belt, measure with a long tape measure to a second point, advance the conveyor then measure from point 2 to a new point 3, and so on until eventually you come back to "start". This is the length.

The automated labeling process began with loading parts onto the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt transported parts to the labeling station that was equipped with photoelectric s ensor, actuator, and labeling machine. When the part arrived on the station, the photoelectric se nsor detected the part and sent a signal to the PLC to stop the conveyor.

A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system, one of the many types of conveyor systems available today. Each conveyor system requires different modules in order to function properly and do the tasks required by the belts . The different tasks can range depending on the weight required, the speed required, and the throughput.
