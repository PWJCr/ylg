## Gyratory Crusher Product Distribution
Gyratory Crushers Gyratory crusher is generally used as a primary crusher. The crusher is popular due to its high throughput capacity and the large sized opening. The crusher is well suited for handling direct feed from haul/dump trucks. The gyratory crusher is mainly used in rock that is abrasive and/or has high compressive strength.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Which motor is preferred for jaw crusher?
How many types of jaw crushers are there? There are two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action. A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates.

## Choosing the Right Rock Crushing Equipment - Amcast
Gyratory Crusher. A gyratory crusher consists of a concave surface and a conical head constructed from heavy steel casting. It works by using a mantle that gyrates within a concave bowl. This rock crushing equipment uses compressive force to fracture the rock and this happens when the mantle makes contact with the bowl during gyration.
