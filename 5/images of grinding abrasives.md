## Main Characteristics & Advantages of Abrasive Belt Grinding Techniques
3. Abrasive belt grinding equipment is easy and safe to operate. Abrasive belt grinding produces low noise and little amount of dust. Since the weight of abrasive belt is light, it is easier to control the balance than grinding wheels. Besides that, the flexible grinding effect of abrasive belts can reduce vibration and impact substantially.

## Grain types — Klingspor Abrasive Technology
The term grain types in the area of abrasives signifies the different types of minerals used during the manufacture of abrasive tools. Since the essential portion of the grinding process, namely the machining of the material to be processed, is performed by these minerals, the grain type used has a major impact on the suitability range and performance of a abrasive.

## Grit, Scratches and Sub-Surface Damage - Part 1
It has become a somewhat common practice to follow a "progression" of increasingly finer grit abrasives when sharpening a blade. In principle, this process is comparable to the procedure for metallographic polishing, which typically consists of three stages, coarse grinding, fine grinding and polishing. These steps are usually characterized by "the scratch pattern" for want.
