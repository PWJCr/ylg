Limestone when heated starts decomposing into lime (CaO) and carbon di-oxide (CO2) at 810 deg C. The process is called calcination of limestone. It is a thermal treatment process which is carried out for the thermal decomposition of the raw limestone for the removal of LOI (loss on ignition) or carbon di-oxide (CO2) part of its composition.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.
