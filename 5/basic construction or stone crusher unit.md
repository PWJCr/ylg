##  STONE CRUSHER
It is advantageous if the crushed stone unit is set up near the queries where the granite boulders of various sizes are available for the crushing unit. The wastage from the granite industry will be of much use to the crushed stone unit. The granite stones of various sizes are fed into the jaw crushers for size reduction.

## Crushers - All crusher types for your reduction needs - Metso Outotec
The same applies to many mobile crushing units. As the number of crushing stages is normally small with this type of plant, it is almost impossible to obtain a good product shape unless the rock is relatively soft and thus more suited for the production of cubic product. A centrifugal crusher in the final stage can help to solve the problem.
