## The Smelting Industry: Global Importance And Risks
5. Metals Extracted Through Smelting . Smelting is a process of extracting metals from their ores at high temperatures. Ores are mostly chemical compounds of metal with other elements, like oxygen sulfur. Smelting utilizes heat, and a reduction agent like coal, to extract the other elements from the metal according to Cornish Mining World Heritage.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.

## what kind of coal is used for smelting
 Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity.

## Limestone and Dolomite and their Use in Iron and Steel Plant
The limestone which is used by iron and steel industry in bulk quantity is a bedded type sedimentary limestone.  During combustion of coal and petroleum products there is high level of SO2 emissions. To control these emissions within norms it becomes necessary to treat the flue gases for SO2 and other acid gases. Lime is used effectively for

Aluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide, alumina, generally by the Hall-Héroult process.Alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the Bayer process at an alumina refinery.. This is an electrolytic process, so an aluminium smelter uses huge amounts of electric power; smelters tend to be located close to large power stations, often hydro-electric
