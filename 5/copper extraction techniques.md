## Copper Leaching Method - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Extraction of copper from suitable ore by leaching methods is generally assumed to cost less than the combined expense of concentration, smelting, and refining, and experimental data tend to confirm this opinion. At the Butte-Duluth plant, which is handling in excess of 100 tons of oxidized ore daily, the copper is said to cost $0.085 per pound.

The Romans improved on the early primitive methods, but without altering the fundamental principle; and, as already mentioned, they successfully smelted sulfide ores, which would have defied the more ancient metallurgists. In Britain there has been found in Anglesey a number of circular cakes of copper which were cast in Roman times.

Jun 7, 2021Copper can be extracted from non-sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulfate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulfate solution by solvent extraction.

The techniques for extraction of copper from oxidized ores are quite different from those employed for the sulfide ores. The oxidized ores, consisting of the silicates, carbonates and sulfates, are treated by several methods, all involving some form of leaching of the crushed ore with sulfuric acid to produce impure solutions of copper sulfate.

Traditional methods. Copper is usually sourced from copper-rich ores in two main methods; Copper can be smelted in a furnace by heating it with air to produce crude copper metal; for example, chalcocite is an ore of copper (I) sulfide, which reacts with oxygen to extract the copper: Cu 2 S (s) + O 2 (g) → 2Cu (s) + SO 2 (g) Copper ore can also be reacted with sulfuric acid to produce copper
