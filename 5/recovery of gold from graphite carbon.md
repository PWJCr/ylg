## Carbon (Carbon-graphite) - CarboSystem
The resistance of carbon materials is only limited by strongly oxidizing media and oxygen. In oxidizing atmospheres carbon graphite materials are stable up to 350°C (660°F), whereas graphitized materials start to be oxidized at 500 to 600°C (930 to 1110°F).

These data illustrate that 40% aqueous solution of acetone is the most effective eluant for gold recovery from activated carbon. This solution was capable of recovering near 90% of the gold adsorbed on activated carbon in approximately 2.5 h at ambient temperature. In contrast, mixture of 10% aqueous solution of isopropanol is the poorest gold

## Common Types of Non-cyanide Gold Recovery Chemicals
The reason why halogens and their compounds can be used as non-cyanide gold recovery chemical is that the oxidation potential when halogens become halogen ions is high enough to dissolve gold. In acidic medium (pH <1), sodium chlorate or chlorine gas is used as oxidant to dissolve gold. The reaction formula is: 3/2Cl2+Au+Cl-→AuCl4-.

## [PDF] Effect of Graphite on the Recovery of Valuable Metals from Spent 
The recycling of valuable metals from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is highly important to secure the sustainable production of new LIBs and reduce the dependence on virgin resources. The present paper aims to study the smelting behaviour of black mass (BM) from spent LIBs and investigate the effect of graphite on metal recovery in a carbon-saturated hot metal bath and in a low-carbon
