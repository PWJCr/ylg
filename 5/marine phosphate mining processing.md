## Phosphate Mining - Biological Diversity
The Mining Process. Strip mining for phosphate rock violently transforms the environment, irreparably changing the character of the natural landscape. In many cases mines displace plants and animals and eat up thousands of acres of valuable habitat that are impossible to restore to their natural state. In Florida habitat loss is a significant

## Phosphate Mining and Processing Infographic | eKonomics
Most phosphate is mined from shallow sedimentary deposits of phosphate rock, or apatite, a calcium-phosphate mineral, deposited in shallow marine environments over millions of years. Other sources are prehistoric marine creatures and calcified bird guano. A few ore sources are of volcanic origin.

The beneficiation plant makes use of about 85% of the total volume of process water used in phosphate rock production. Phosphate rocks from crushing and screening, which contain about 60% tricalcium phosphate, are fed into the beneficiation plant for upgrading by rejection of the larger than 4 mm over-size particles.

It is also expected that the company must fund the monitoring capacity of phosphate mining through the establishment of a centre of excellence to monitor impacts of phosphate mining on the marine ecosystem. This will help develop generic standards and guidelines for monitoring marine phosphate mining and processing in Namibia.
