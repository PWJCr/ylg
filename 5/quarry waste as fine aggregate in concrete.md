## Quarry Limestone Dust as Fine Aggregate for Concrete
In quarrying activities, rock is extracted and transformed into aggregate of various sizes for civil engineering applications. In this process waste fine aggregates (dust waste) are generated. The disposal of this type of waste is a further cost in the extraction process, but also a possible cause of environmental pollution (e.g. leaching into water reserves, atmospheric pollution as a result

## Review of Durability, Workability and Strength of Concrete by Replacing 
Because of increasing the use of natural sand as construction material, we need to focus on the use of alternate materials to protect the nature. In this paper, a literature review is conducted to emphasis the use of quarry dust and foundry sand in concrete as the placement of fine aggregate. Quarry dust and foundry sand are the waste by-products formed by stone crushing process and metal

## Strength and Durability Evaluation of Recycled Aggregate Concrete 
This paper discusses the suitability of producing concrete with 100 % recycled aggregate to meet durability and strength requirements for different applications. Aggregate strength, gradation, absorption, specific gravity, shape and texture are some of the physical and mechanical characteristics that contribute to the strength and durability of concrete. In general, the quality of recycled

Feb 3, 2022Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of aggregate often used in road construction. Fine aggregate: Most fine aggregates consist of crushed stone or natural sand. Most of the present particles must be able to pass through a 3/8-inch sieve.
