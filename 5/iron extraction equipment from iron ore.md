## Iron Extraction Blast Furnace Metallurgy - Collegedunia
The extraction of iron occurs in the blast furnace. The term "blast" refers to the supply of combustion air above atmospheric pressure. The concentrated ore is reduced to a liquid chemical condition in the blast furnace. The concentrated iron ore, coke, and limestone are supplied from the top and a blast of hot air is forced into the bottom of

## How Is Iron Extracted From Its Ore - Realonomics
They are reduction of the ore with carbon reduction of the molten ore by electrolysis and reduction of the ore with a more reactive metal. Why can iron be extracted from its ore using carbon? This method of extraction works because carbon is more reactive than iron so it can displace iron from iron compounds. In the reaction of iron(III) oxide

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Iron ore extraction techniques - ScienceDirect
The extraction of iron ore from reserves in the ground had been practiced in the United Kingdom from Roman times. Smith (1990)  There have been significant changes to the equipment being used and the volumes of ore being mined. Ore is mined from two large open pits, and a third mining area to the north of the existing mine has been developed

## Iron Extraction by Blast Furnace Metallurgy - VEDANTU
Iron, when extracted from iron ore such as haematite containing iron (III) oxide, Fe2O3, in a blast furnace is called iron extraction blast furnace metallurgy. In this reduction reaction, oxygen is removed from the iron (III) oxide to leave behind iron. Generally, the extraction of metals and their isolation are based on three major procedures.
