## process of nickel ore mining
Mining Process for PolyMet Project PolyMet Mining. In this stage of the process, copper and nickel are recovered from the pulverized ore particles and turned into a saleable concentrate. In flotation, the pulverized ore particles are mixed and pumped with water into large tanks, commonly called flotation cells.

The process culminates in an electric arc or blast furnace, which renders the unwanted impurities into slag and allows the molten mixture to be cast into molds, forming nickel pig iron. The main advantage of the smelting process is that it is a proven technology and can process saprolite ores (high magnesium), in relative terms, quickly. As

## Process Of Nickel Mining
The Nickel Mining Process It's not unexpected that the mining processes for nickel differ because nickel is found in two quite different forms of ore. Although some deposits were mined using open pits in the early phases, sulfide deposits are mainly mined using underground techniques similar to copper.

After mining, nickel ores are further processed to upgrade their nickel contents from 1-4% typical of the ores to concentrates with grades in the range 10-20%. Concentration involves crushing the ore and separating nickel-bearing from other minerals using various physical and chemical processing .
