A quarry is a place where rocks, sand, or minerals are extracted from the surface of the Earth. A quarry is a type of mine called an open-pit mine, because it is open to the Earth 's surface. Another type of mine, a sub-surface mine, consists of underground tunnels or shafts. The most common purpose of quarries is to extract stone for building

## Quarry
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.). There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types ( mines and caves). For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries. In the 18th century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was

## Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods, Selection of Site  - CivilSeek
The process of extraction of suitable stones from their natural rock beds or layers is commonly called Quarrying of Stones. It differs from the mining of ores of metals in that whereas quarrying is an operation carried out entirely on the surface, mining involves digging below the ground, sometimes at considerable depth.
