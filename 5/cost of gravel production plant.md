## How to Make Gravel and Sand
The intense action created by the tumbling of rock particles thoroughly disintegrates the clay fraction and prepares the material for final sizing. The scrubber discharge is screened at ½- inch to produce a 1½" x ½" roadstone product which is stockpiled. Next, the ½" x 3/8" pea gravel is screened out and stockpiled.
