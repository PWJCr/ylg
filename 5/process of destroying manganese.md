## How to Remove Manganese From Water (Step-by-Step)
Option 1: Use Air Injection Oxidation to Remove Manganese. Oxidation filtration involves injecting oxygen into the water to eliminate impurities such as iron, arsenic, and manganese. It is an effective method used to remove ions that form manganese in water. Manganese usually exists in its unprecipitated state in water.

## Manganese
Manganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is a hard, brittle,  (OH)) and elemental manganese (Mn): This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility. In 1972 the CIA's Project Azorian,

The density of manganese oxide ore is generally about 3.7~3.9t/m3, which is significantly different from silicate type gangue. Commonly used gravity separators include mineral jigs, shaker table, cyclones, chutes, and the like. The density of manganese carbonate ore is 3.3~3.6t/m3, which has a small difference from the density of gangue.

## manganese processing | Britannica
manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.

In fact, the water gets a black color and a metallic taste. Similar to iron, the manganese removal by physical-chemical way, can be carried out by the oxidation of Mn 2+ in Mn 4+, which precipitates then in manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ). The precipitation is then separated from water by filtration on sand. The only difference (with the iron), is

## Example of chemical weatheringawech
Sometimes called mechanical weathering, physical weathering is the process that breaks rocks apart without changing their chemical composition. These examples illustrate physical weathering : Swiftly moving water Rapidly moving water can lift, for short periods of time, rocks from the stream bottom. When these rocks drop, they collide with other rocks, breaking tiny pieces off.

There are two ways manganese can occur in water - dissolved manganese and solid (precipitate form) manganese. What's more, manganese can be found both in city water and well water. In water from certain deep wells, the concentration may hit a level of 3 parts per million (PPM). However, the big question is: when does it become toxic?
