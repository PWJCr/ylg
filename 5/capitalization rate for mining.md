## Cap Rate Calculator
To calculate the market value of your property, you simply have to divide the net income by the cap rate: $33,600 / 9.7% = $33,600 / 0.097 = $346,392. This result is the value of your property. Of course, consider this as a rule of thumb - there might be other reasons for increasing or lowering the selling price.

## Understanding the Capitalization Rate - First National Realty Partners
A property's Capitalization ("Cap") Rate is a measure of its annual rate of return on investment assuming an all cash purchase. For this reason, it can be a good metric to compare potential acquisitions, regardless of physical differences. There are two major inputs needed to calculate the Cap Rate, Net Operating Income (NOI) and Purchase

Cap Rate = NOI / Purchase Price Cap Rate = 100,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.10 à 10%. NOI divided by purchase price, gives us 0.10. Cap Rates are presented in percentages therefore we multiply by 100 to get a percentage. Our Cap Rate in this example is 10%. Ok, great, we used some simple arithmetic and got number.

The capitalization rate, often just called the cap rate, is the ratio of Net Operating Income (NOI) to property asset value. So, for example, if a property recently sold for $1,000,000 and had an NOI of $100,000, then the cap rate would be $100,000/$1,000,000, or 10%.
