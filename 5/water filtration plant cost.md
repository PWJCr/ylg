San Antonio currently is building what will be the largest brackish water desal plant in the country. In its first phase, it produces 12 million gallons a day, enough for 40,000 families, but by 2026, the plant - known as H2Oaks - will produce 30 million gallons a day. Brackish water de-sal costs $1,000 to $2,000 per acre-foot.
