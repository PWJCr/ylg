## History of coal mining in the United States
The history of coal mining in the United States goes back to the 1300s, when the Hopi Indians used coal. [citation needed] The first commercial use came in 1701, within the Manakin-Sabot area of Richmond, Virginia.Coal was the dominant power source in the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and although in rapid decline it remains a significant source of energy in 2019.

1700s-1800s: During the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, the mining industry grew due to demand from Britain, with at least one metal mine in almost every county. Copper, lead-silver and other minerals, such as iron were mined along with extensive coal mining.

Coal was one of the most important things in Victorian life. It provided heat for homes and fuel for cooking. It was also the fuel that ran the country's factories and railways. Britain was rich in coal. It could be found right across Scotland, Wales and England. Few pieces of machinery were used to dig the coal out of the ground.

Most of the coal mining done from the 1800s to the 1920s and 30s (when oil started replacing coal as a fuel source in Texas) used underground methods, where vertical shafts or sloped adits (tunnel entrance) provided access to the mine workings. Surface strip mining (also known as area, open pit or open cast mining ) to extract lignite was used.

## History of coal mining
Before 1800 a great deal of coal was left in place as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep Tyneside pits (300 to 1,000 ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800.  Coal Mining Industry in India (1998)

The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.
