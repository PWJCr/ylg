• Build a Marble Machine so the marble travels up and down, side to side, goes behind the board (right), or starts and stops. • Add a simple circuit to the path of the marble to turn on a battery-powered motor, fan, or light! • Try using strips of foil (left) as the switch, tripped by a metal marble that completes the circut as it rolls down

Tiny Marble Machine. Artist Daniel de Bruin is an expert at making metal tracks for marble machines. He's taught us how to make our own, and even made a room-sized marble track. Now, he's downsized his efforts, creating the tiniest marble course we've ever seen, using a custom drive mechanism, 0.6mm wire, and a 5mm wide ball bearing.

Place the second pegboard panel on top. Use at least three dowels to align the holes in the top panel with the one on the bottom. It is important to make sure the dowels will stick straight out when you're building your marble run. Stick dowels through both sets of holes, and visually check that they are vertical.

There are a couple of things you could try to make the funnel last longer. Firstly, the angle of the walls, make sure they are not steep, make them as flat as possible. Secondly, the angle the ball enters the funnel. Make sure it enters in the direction you want the marble to travel and at the top of the funnel.

## Tinkering Project: Marble Machines | Exploratorium
Marble Machines. A Marble Machine is a creative ball-run contraption, made from familiar materials, designed to send a rolling marble through tubes and funnels, across tracks and bumpers, and into a catch at the end. We often suggest a goal of getting the marble to travel from the top of the board to a target at the bottom as slowly as possible.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

Marble has been the preferred material for stone monumental sculpture since ancient times, with several advantages over its more common geological "parent" limestone, in particular the ability to absorb light a small distance into the surface before refracting it in subsurface scattering.This gives an attractive soft appearance that is especially good for representing human skin, which can
