Crushed glass has also been put to good usein the filtration industry. Itcan be used to producefilters wherepreviously silica sand was used. The suggested size for crushed glass granules in filters is 0.5 to 1 mm, which produces extremely clear filtered water. Applications include filtration for drinking water, swimming pools and industrial use.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

Crushed glass chips add versatility and attractive options across different application types including terrazzo flooring, lawns and gardens, and glassphalt projects. Glass is 100% recyclable and comes from post-industrial and post-consumer recycled sources. Buildings often discard glass products, which if contaminated may end up in landfills.
