## Flavins secreted by roots of iron‐deficient Beta vulgaris enable mining 
Introduction. Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plants and the fourth most abundant element in the lithosphere (Marschner, 1995).However, the solubility of soil Fe is generally controlled by those of scarcely soluble Fe(III)-oxides and oxyhydroxides, which are minimal at pH values typical of calcareous soils (7.4-8.5); the Fe concentration in these soil solutions is c. 10 −10 M

Simple Solution for H2S Removal. Iron Oxide Systems (IOS) utilize one of the most common methods of gas sweetening in which a chemical reaction process using iron oxide media in a contact vessel removes H2S from the gas stream. This unit offers excellent removal of H2S and other mercaptans and works well with varying volumes and H2S levels.

A chemical process to eliminate about 90% of magnetite was developed. A sample of powdered ancient pottery was treated in a mixture (3:1:1) of HCl, HNO (3) and H (2)O (2) for 4h. After that, it was washed several times in distilled water to remove all acid matrixes. The original black sample becomes somewhat clearer.

## Ferric Oxide - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The solid-phase reagents used in the ADVIA Centaur assays are suspensions of micron sized, specially coated ferric oxide particles. These particles are small enough to provide extremely high surface area for rapid binding kinetics and stay in suspension for prolonged periods but are rapidly and cleanly separated through their paramagnetic attraction when placed in a magnetic field.
