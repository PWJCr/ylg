gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

A slurry of ground ore, water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved. Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver. This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.

Mining water use is water used for the extraction of minerals that may be in the form of solids, such as coal, iron, sand, and gravel; liquids, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural gas. The category includes quarrying, milling of mined materials, injection of water for secondary oil recovery or for unconventional oil and gas recovery (such as hydraulic fracturing), and other

The gold was concentrated by washing away the lighter river sands with water, leaving behind the dense gold particles, which could then be further concentrated by melting. By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed.

## Processes of gold ore separation,the process of gold extraction,gold 
The three most commonly used processes for gold ore separation are: gravity separation, flotation and cyanidation. Among them, gravity separation is a commonly used process in placer gold mines, flotation is mostly used in rock gold mines, and cyanidation is suitable for refractory gold ores such as oxide ore and flotation concentrate.

## Ways To Process Gold Ores - JXSC Machine
Jun 4, 2021The use of gold and other minerals than the difference in flotation. The larger the difference in specific gravity, the easier to separate. The gold-bearing sands are placed into the cylinder sieve and flowed through the high-pressure water, and the gravel sands larger than the sieve holes are transported into the tailing field through the chute and belt; the sands smaller than the sieve holes

## Understanding water use in mining and mineral processing
Water management in mining and mineral processing. Water is essential to mineral processing. It is used in various steps in the process to recover valuable metals from ore. The water use is quite high - for example, around 1600 litres of water are used to obtain the 19 kilograms of copper found in a medium-sized family car.
