the cement kiln system. Sulfur in cement kilns is derived from both kiln feed and from the kiln fuel. The form of the sulfur dictates the location in the kiln where the SO2 generation takes place. Sulfur in the fuel is oxidized in the burning zone or calciner, and is easily removed by reactive lime present in the kiln.
