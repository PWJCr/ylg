 · The production process for cement consists of drying grinding and mixing limestone and additives like bauxite and iron ore into a powder known as raw meal. The raw meal is then heated and burned in a pre-heater and kiln and then cooled in an air cooling system to form a semi-finished product known as a clinker.

## raw meal drying in cement process
Raw Meal Drying In Cement Process. Raw Meal Drying In Cement Process. During the cement production process, so 2 originated from both raw meal and fuel.Among them, part of the sulfur from raw meal was oxidized to so 2 in the preheater system and left with flue gas, then a portion of the so 2 was captured by the.

## Homogenization (BLENDING) - Cement Plant Optimization
Advantages of CF Silos over Batch Type Blending Silos. Low Compressor power consumption. Turbulent mixing (air merge) 1.5 - 2.5 kWh/t. Controlled flow, inverted cone 0.25 - 0.5 and for multi outlet 0.10-0.13 kWh/t. Effective capacity of a CF silo is some 20% greater as the raw meal is not heavily aerated. Caution: Blending silos are very prone
