## Crushed Rock Landscapes-Bandage on a Larger Problem
Crushed rock is mined from hills around the periphery of Tucson, Phoenix, Yuma, Prescott and other rapidly growing cities. Much of what is advertised as decomposed granite isn't really granite. I've seen crushed quartzite, andesite, and volcanic rhyolite sold, in a wide array of appealing colors.

## Using Volcanic Rock Dust in Your Garden | Organic Soil & Compost
The general principle is to spread three tons of volcanic rock dust per acre, which comes to about 1.25 pounds per square yard. In the metric system, this comes up to 750 grams per meter. Therefore, you should plan on about 10 to 15 pounds of rock dust being enough to re-mineralize a hundred square feet of garden space for up to three years.

Crushed rock is machined-crushed rock and screened. The rock is angular with jagged edges. The minus after the size (3/4″ Minus or 3/4-") means that all the fines, smaller pieces or stone dust are included up to 3/4". The fines help for tamping or compacting to ensure a stable and hard surface.

## The Best Rocks for a Driveway | eHow
Crushed rock is different from gravel, which is made by weathering and erosion processes. Limestone and dolemite are two of the largest supplies of crushed rock on Earth. This type of rock is popular due to its ability to shed water with proper yard drainage and because the rocks can be paved over easily in the future if needed.
