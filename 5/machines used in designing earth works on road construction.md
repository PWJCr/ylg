## DIY Dam Design & Construction: Water Retention - One Community
Track roll the earth dam keyway and wall every 200 mm (7 inches). The basic process is to lay out soil about 200 mm in depth. Then to pass over the soil again and again until depth is about 6 inches (150 mm). If using a sheepsfoot roller, this takes somewhere between 6-12 passes at a roller speed of 2-4 mph (3-6km/hr).
