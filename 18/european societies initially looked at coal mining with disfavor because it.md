## History of Mining in Illinois - About Mine Subsidence - Illinois Mine 
The first discovery of coal in North America was in Illinois by Marquette and Joliet. In 1673, they observed and recorded coal outcrops along the Illinois river. However, it wasn't until the 1800's that the settlers first mined outcropped coal for blacksmithing and other domestic uses. It took underground mining a few more years to get started

Brown coal or Subitumous - is a slightly better fuel than peat. These have been buried and hardened and so contain more carbon. It is a soft, black coal often used on fires in homes. Bituminous Coal - is found at deeper levels and so is much harder and richer in carbon. It is a medium-hard, black coal often used on fires in homes.

## Coal | National Geographic Society
Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

## Oroonoko: 1. Oroonoko in Coramantien Summary & Analysis
Oroonoko is one of the first novels ever written in English, and so the genre was still being invented at the time. Thus Behn conflates fiction with autobiography, claiming that her account is true while also clearly inventing most of it. Little is known of Behn's life, so we can't be sure how many of the events come from firsthand experience, but certainly it is fictional at its core.
