The coarse jaw crusher has a large amount of dust emission, while the cone crusher is much better. Compared with the cone crusher, the sealing of the jaw crusher is relatively poor. The cone crusher spreads less dust with a deep crushing cavity. What's more, the materials of jaw crushers are usually larger or sticky, which increases its dust
