## The World's 20 Largest Copper Mines - ThoughtCo
The world's 20 largest copper mines produce nearly 9 million metric tons of the precious metal a year, about 40% of the world's total copper mine capacity. Chile and Peru, alone, account for more than half of the copper mines on this list. The U.S. makes the cut, as well, with two mines among the top 20. Copper is expensive to mine and refine.

Copper minerals are found in over one hundred varieties although only a few have been worked for copper on a large scale. The most abundant ores are chalcopyrite and bornite which contain both copper and iron sulphides. These account for about 80% of the world's known ores.
