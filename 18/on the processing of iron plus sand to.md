Sep 7, 2022At room temperature, pure iron has a bcc structure referred to as alpha-ferrite; this persists until the temperature is raised to 912° C (1,674° F), when it transforms into an fcc arrangement known as austenite. With further heating, austenite remains until the temperature reaches 1,394° C (2,541° F), at which point the bcc structure reappears.

## Process Capabilities and Limitations of Ducitle Iron Sand Casting
Ductile Iron and Sand. Sand plays a vital role in the casting process. Being slightly permeable, it allows gas to move out while at the same time chilling the liquid metal, which solidifies from the outside in. Packing density and sand composition must be managed carefully to ensure consistent metal shrinkage and part quality.
