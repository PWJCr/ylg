## Conveyor Tail And Drive Pulleys - Belt Conveyor Propulsion - Cisco-Eagle
The tail pulley is located at the tail end of the conveyor and it turns freely. Now a "belt" can be put around the pulleys. The Drive Pulley turns and moves the belt around (and around, and around). But it is dangerous to have the belt hang down under the conveyor bed. So small rollers are put into the Conveyor Bed to hold up the belt.
