The current mine plan outlines a phased approach with Phase1 mill capacity expected to be around 3 750 tons per day. The mill capacity in Phase 2 is expected to increase to 6 000 tons per day, with ore being sourced from both, underground and open pits starting in year 4 and with ore being sourced entirely from underground during the first years.

## Utah Gold - Utah Geological Survey
Gold-bearing solutions deposited gold within the surrounding rock formations (lode or primary deposit). As these gold-bearing rocks are eroded, the free gold is deposited and concentrated into placer (or secondary) deposits. Finding gold is possible in any stream or river that crosses a gold-mineralized area.

Open-pit gold-silver mines use one of several processing methods depending on deposit characteristics, so our examination of costs considers open-pit mining and five different processing methods. Heap-leach processing is designed for low-grade gold or gold-silver deposits where gold is in predominantly oxide minerals or non-mineral materials.
