Sep 16, 2020· Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore, and magnetite, as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification. Hematite, however, responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite, so it is the preferred type of ore.

An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.
