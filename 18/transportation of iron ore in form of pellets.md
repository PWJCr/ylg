## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
During pelletizing, ore powder is rolled into iron ore green pellets in rotating drums together with water, binding agents and additives. Globules with grain sizes of approx. 15 mm are produced, which are then baked into porous pellets. Pellets are mainly produced by special ore suppliers and then delivered to the ironworks.

HBI is the compacted form of DRI (Direct Reduction Iron) developed during the past 25 years to decrease the risks in respect of the handling and shipping because it is indeed less reactive compared to DRI. World exports of HBI were more than. HBI is the product of reducing iron ore with natural gas. This is called the direct reduction process
