## Extractive Metallurgy of Copper - Meaning, Method and Example - VEDANTU
Smelting of Copper. Smelting is really a metallurgical technique for extracting base metals from their ores with both the support of heat as well as a chemical reducing agent. Copper Smelting indicates that only the concentrated ore is intensely warmed up by silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and air within the kiln.

Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27-29% copper); the remainder of the concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of pyrite

Minerals are concentrated into a slurry that is about 15% copper. Waste slag is removed. Water is recycled. Tailings (left-over earth) containing copper oxide are routed to leaching tanks or are returned to the surrounding terrain.

## Procedure to leach copper concentrates, under pressure and at ambient 
A chemical process to leach copper concentrates in the presence of a concentrated solution of sulfates and chlorides.The process includes forming a high reactivity chemical paste containing a high concentration of ions in the liquid phase of the paste which react with copper ores and forms a series of soluble salts. The salts are extracted by a simple wash.

The gangue particles can consist of a range of silicate minerals from quartz to talc and clays. Carbonate mineral gangue can also be present. When liberated, typical copper sulphide minerals are relatively easy to float. When there are no overriding metallurgical issues, producing a sufficiently high copper concentrate grade is often the focus.
