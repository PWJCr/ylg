## What is Electrochemical Grinding (ECG)? Process, Diagram, Advantages 
Advantages of Electrochemical Grinding. Electrochemical grinding provides excellent surface finish ranging from 0.05 to 1 µm. It provides better accuracy (0.01 mm) by selecting the wheel grit size and abrasive particles accurately. Insignificant tool wear. No need of "wheel dressing" repeatedly, hence it saves a considerable amount of time.

## Electrochemical machining
Electrochemical machining (ECM) is a method of removing metal by an electrochemical process. It is normally used for mass production and is used for working extremely hard materials or materials that are difficult to machine using conventional methods. Its use is limited to electrically conductive materials. ECM can cut small or odd-shaped angles, intricate contours or cavities in hard and

## Electrochemical Grinding(ECG)
Electrochemical Grinding (ECG) is a combination of electrochemical (Anodic) dissolution of a material, according to Faraday's Law, and light abrasive action. The metal is decomposed to some degree by the DC current flow between the conductive grinding wheel (Cathode) and the work piece (Anode) in the presence of an electrolyte solution.
