## The Cement Manufacturing Process - Advancing Mining
Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are

## clay to powder manufacturing process
When you buy dry clay it comes in powder form Just add the dry clay to water and mix really well then wedge it really well, and you are ready to go. There are many colors, textures, and cone sizes to choose from. Another way I like a lot is recycled clay. Dry the scrap clay out completely then add it to a bucket of water.

Firstly, relatively moist clay is taken, which has about 30% water by weight. It is then placed into a mould, either by hand or with a moulding machine and is pressed into the moulds. To keep the clay from sticking to the moulds, the moulds may be dipped in water immediately before being filled.

During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of the raw materials and recombined into new compounds. The clinker is cooled and ground to a fine powder with the addition of about 3 to 5% of gypsum. By this process, the product formed is Portland cement.
