To farm for Copper Ore, you should play through levels 2 through 39. These are the levels in which Copper Ore is most likely to spawn. Once you're done, you can just go back up in the elevator and redo them. To farm Iron Ore, you should play through levels 40 to 79 of the mines, since that is where Iron Nodes are most likely to spawn.

The preliminary step of copper ore grinding machine is crushing. Crushing is often split into three phases, namely, primary crushing, secondary crushing and fine crushing. To accomplish primary crushing, individuals normally make use of a jaw crusher or impact crusher. They're able to crush copper ore into extra compact dimensions.

Most often the copper minerals are floated after galena depression. Galena is depressed using sodium dichromate, sodium sulfite, polysaccharide (starch, dextrin) or even CMC. Addition rates of these depressants can be critical if any recirculating load is returned to the bulk rougher circuit. This flotation step is conducted at alkaline pH.
