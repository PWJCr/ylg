Induction Hardening is a heat-treatment process performed to harden the surface of the gear by induction-heating steel with a minimum composition of 0.3 percent carbon. In this process, an induction coil is place around the gear and a current is passed through the coil. This electrical current heats the steel quickly, followed by quenching.

## Steels - (High Chromium Steels) Stainless Steels
High carbon high chrome steels are heat treatable as a consequence of the higher carbon content, and are known as martensitic stainless steels (e.g. 410, 416). They do, however, exhibit lower corrosion resistance due to chromium depletion of the oxide film. They exhibit good strength and oxidation resistance up to 750°C, although their creep

## The Hardening -Toughening Heat Treatment Process Of HiGH Chrome Cast 
Abstract： The influence of quenching-tempering heat treatment, conventional austempering heat treatment and multi-stage austenitizing austempering heat treatment on the microstructure and property of high chrome cast iron grinding balls were comparatively investigated. The results show that the impact toughness and impact fatigue resistance of the grinding balls are higher after austempering.
