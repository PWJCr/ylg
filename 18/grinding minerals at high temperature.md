## Minerals Grinding At High Temperature Cement
This chemical reaction occurs at high temperature in a rotary kiln, • grinding the cement clinker nodules to passing 90 microns in a dry circuit. 2. Grinding occurs at the beginning and the end of the cement making process. Approximately 1.5 tonnes of raw materials are required to produce 1 tonne of finished cement.
