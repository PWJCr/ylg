## Crushers and Their Types - IspatGuru
Crushers are also classified by their method of mechanically transmitted fracturing energy to the material. Jaw, gyratory and roll crushers work by applying compressive forces while impact crushers such as hammer crusher apply high speed impact force to accomplish fracturing. There are several types of crushers which are used in various industries.
