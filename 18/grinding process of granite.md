Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut into slabs is then split to make other smaller products such as sidewalks, wall blocks or paving stones.

The basic purpose of grinding coffee beans is to facilitate the extraction process by exposing more surface area to the hot water. Basically, the process of making coffee happens as roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with hot water that 'extracts' the flavour, ideally resulting in a delicious cup of brew.

7) Honed granite is more expensive than polished granite. Between honed and polished granite, it takes a lot more work to create polished granite. This is mainly due to the grinding process. Most people would think that polished granite would cost more due to the extra work it takes to make it. However, that's not the case.

The wet grinding process occurs when a product is transformed from solid to liquid, regardless of its viscosity: paints, inks, enamels, nail varnish, among others. In this process, agglomerates that were not separated in the dispersion phase (due to the electro-physical bonding of some components) are broken by applying extra energy..

## The processing of granite from raw blocks to polished slabs - Sati 
Grinding is a process to smoothen the surface of the granite, so they lose their grainy finish, as a result of the cutting process and achieve a smooth to touch finish. Grinding is done in a grinding machine with multiples heads attached to diamond abrasives of different densities to achieve an even surface finish.

## 4 Steps of Marble Floor Restoration (Get a Free Estimate)
Marble floor restoration procedure typically takes 4 steps: 1st step is grinding. It's the most powerful and dynamic step, also known as lippage removal, delipping or flattening. Even new installed marble floors can have some tiles to be upper or lower of floor flatness. This step removes all ledges, roughness and brings flatness to marble

## The Granite Processing Life Cycle - RegattaGranitesIndia
Dec 1, 2021After the granite slabs are cut, grinding is done. In other words, it refers to the smoothening of granite surfaces. This is done to smoother the surface which suffers some degradation during the cutting. A special grinding machine is used to carry out this process which contains multiple heads.
