## Galvanizing Kettle melted, why? How to prevent it and prolong life.
Jan 6, 2022January 24, 2022. A. The kettle wall gets eroded by dissolving in the zinc it is containing. At 450 °C it will lose about 1-2 mm/year. At 550 °C it can loose 10 mm/day. If you had temperature control issues and overheated the kettle, then this is to be expected. If it didn't perforate and so leak, you were mighty lucky.

## Galvanizing Furnace and Kettle - Hot Dip Galvanizing Line
Heating can be affected by natural gas, oil, and electrical heating. Galvanizing furnace heat the kettle, which contains zinc for coating. It is available to change, restore or upgrade the kettle. The average life of the kettle is 8-10 years. Galvanizing kettles are fabricated from the special steel material having low carbon and silicon contents.
