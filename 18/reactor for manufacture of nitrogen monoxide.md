Discussion. Nitrogen monoxide, NO, is a pollutant formed by the reaction of nitrogen gas, N 2, and oxygen gas, O 2, at high temperatures in automobile engines and other high-temperature combustion processes.Most of the waste NO from automotive engines is converted back to nitrogen gas, N 2 and O 2 by the catalytic converter. However, a small amount still escapes into the atmosphere.

A novel rotary reactor was proposed for nitrogen oxides (NO x) reduction by carbon monoxide (CO) in order to avoid the oxygen inhibition effect.NO x adsorption and reduction were separated into two different zones in the proposed rotary reactor. NO x in the flue gas was adsorbed onto the catalyst surface in the adsorption zone and then reduced by the reducing gas in the reduction zone.

Trace gases include neon, methane, helium, krypton, hydrogen, xenon, ozone, and many other elements and compounds. The composition of air varies from one place to the next and even varies.

## SOLVED:What atmospheric reaction produces nitrogen monoxide, NO 
To form nitrogen monoxide, you start with nitrogen dioxide and you apply photons of light energy and then you get and no and an oxygen radical. Um This is similar to the production of ammonia because you need a high energy catalyst. Um Just like when you're combining nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia, you need to add a significant amount of heat or else the reaction will progress.
