## How can mining become more environmentally sustainable?
Mining can become more environmentally sustainable1 by developing and integrating practices that reduce the environmental impact of mining operations. These practices include measures such as reducing water and energy consumption, minimizing land disturbance and waste production, preventing soil, water, and air pollution at mine sites, and conducting successful mine closure and reclamation

Environmental Impacts. Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from coal mines or metal mines, often abandoned mines where ore- or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing the sulphur-bearing mineral pyrite.

Copper mining and copper processing have environmental impacts, starting with the impact on the earth by enormous open-pit mines all the way through the processing process and the toxic by-products produced.  Toxic chemicals, by-products of mining and ore processing, such as arsenic and lead, can escape into rivers and soil and harm wildlife

## Office of Wastewater Management - Hardrock Mining: Environmental Impacts
Hardrock Mining: Environmental Impacts. Overview. Hardrock mining is a large-scale industrial activity that takes place in the natural environment, potentially disturbing large amounts of material and land area. Hardrock mining generates large volumes of mining waste because of the high waste-to-product ratios associated with producing most ores.

## Environmental Issues in Gemstone Mining — Gemstones and Sustainable 
Environmental impacts of mining largely depend on the methods used and the geological context that governs how easily the minerals can be separated from the ore material. Unlike gold mining, which often uses potentially toxic chemicals such as mercury and cyanide, gemstone mining does not depend on chemicals for extraction of the rough material.

Environmental and social impacts of mining. Mining is a short-term activity with long-term effects. There can be no doubt that when it takes place in forest zones, it is a factor of degradation. It is calculated that, together with oil prospecting, mining is threatening 38% of the last stretches of the world's primary forests.

All mining activities have an impact on the environment. The extent to which the impact on the environment is permissible is governed by the law, which exists to protect the nature, ecosystems and us humans. The environmental impact from a mining operations varies, primarily depending upon the materials being mined and how the management of waste is dealt with.

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

## Environmental Risks of Mining - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
ISL mining has environmental and safety advantages over conventional mining in that the ore body is dissolved and then pumped out, leaving minimal surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock (World Nuclear Association, 2012).  (2005). Guidebook on environmental impact assessment for in situ leach mining projects. Retrieved from http

## Environmental Impacts of Mining and Smelting - OK International
Occupational and environmental exposure to heavy metals, silica, and asbestos can occur during mining and milling operations. The smelting process (extracting the metal from the ore) is associated with the highest exposures and environmental releases. The hazards to human health caused by exposure to heavy metals - including lead, cadmium and

## Mining and the African Environment - Society for Conservation Biology
Some of the environmental impacts of African mining development could potentially be offset: mining set-asides could protect some wildlife habitats, whereas improving transportation networks could increase crop yields and spare land for conservation.
