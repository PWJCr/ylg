## Building-Stone Geology - Field Lab Examples
Sep 6, 2022The first step is for the students to choose building sites and be introduced to building owners. The students are told to take the perspective of an impartial geologist consulted by the building owner to advise on the best rock type for a given job. They will be examining the rock type currently in use and comparing it to three others.

Insulation: Stone cladding can be easily coupled with thermal insulation products that are designed to reduce the heat loss or heat gain of a building envelope. The insulation should be non-combustible, rot and vermin proof and non-absorbent. In designing the insulation layer, strive for the lowest possible U-Value.
