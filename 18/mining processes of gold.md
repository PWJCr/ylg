The two entered into an agreement to conduct the trials of the CSIRO's new recovery process at the Tunkillia gold project, which have the potential to completely change gold mining. If the trials are successful, Minotaur says it will "obviate the need for pre-stripping and open cut mining of the oxide resources.

In modern times though, mining for gold is a much more intensive, yet sophisticated process. Most surface, or alluvial gold has been found, which is why gold is mainly mined from the earth today. It's largely a matter of technology and requires much expertise and elaborate equipment. Mining for gold today can essentially be broken down into 9

Biomining is mineral processing with microbes. Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste. Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals. Valuable metals are commonly bound up in solid minerals. Some microbes can oxidize those metals, allowing them to dissolve in

## An Overview of the Five Stages of Gold Mining - MiningNewsWire
To a casual observer, mining gold seems simple: find ore, extract it then process it into gold. However, this isn't the case since mining for gold is a more complex process which occurs in stages.. Before the precious metal can be extracted, firms are required to explore the area in order to accurately determine the size of the deposit and how the ore can be extracted and processed

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by
