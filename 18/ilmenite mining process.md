## ilmenite beneficiation process
Mining process. A large artificial freshwater pond is created in the dunes, on which floats the dredger and concentrator plant. While the dredge removes the material from the front end of the pond, the tailings generated by the separation process is stacked at the back; as a result the pond continuously moves in a forward direction.

## How to separate sand rutile ilmenite and zircon?
The first stage of the mining process is to remove all timber and topsoil from the mine site. The topsoil is stockpiled for later rehabilitation of the site after mining has been completed.  Zircon has low magnetic susceptibility and electrical conductivity whereas ilmenite has high magnetic susceptibility and rutile has high electrical

## Ilmenite
Ilmenite can be converted into pigment grade titanium dioxide via either the sulfate process or the chloride process. Ilmenite can also be improved and purified to titanium dioxide in the form of rutile using the Becher process.  Iluka Resources' mining operations in Australia including Murray Basin, Eneabba and Capel.
