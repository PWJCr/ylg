## Explained: That's why there are stones on train tracks, know 
When the train moves on the track, all the weight falls on the sleeper made of concrete. The stones around it make it easy for the concrete sleeper to remain stable. Sleepers do not slip because of these stones. One of the purposes of laying ballast on the track is that there is no problem of water logging in the tracks.

Railroad tracks can change due to heat, cold, ground movement, vibrations, and even growing weeds. These elements may cause the tracks to become more brittle or unstable, thus making passing through them all the more dangerous! The ballast protects the tracks from these elements, and in turn, protects those riding on trains.

The rail lengths were laid in the brackets secured to either stone slabs or wooden sleepers and a wooden wedge was driven in to hold the rail in place.
