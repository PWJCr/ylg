Though the hardness value of quartz (i.e. 7 on the Mohr's scale) is a bit higher than the iron ore (Hematite (5.5-6.5), Magnetite (5.5-6), it is far more brittle than iron ore (Gribble, 1988).

## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.

Kumba Iron Ore's Sishen mine in South Africa produces 41 Mt of iron ore per annum from its beneficiation plants. The orebody consists mainly of laminated and massive haematite ore, of which 34 M/a is crushed to -90 mm before beneficiation by means of a combination of Wemco drums and dense medium cyclones.

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

Iron has a number of advantages over copper, brass, wood, and stone. The use of iron ushered in an Iron Age in Africa, with the expansion of agriculture, industry, trade, and political power. In some African cultures, smelters and ironworkers are of low status because of the manual labor inherent in their work.
