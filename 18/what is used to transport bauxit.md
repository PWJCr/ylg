Bauxite has also seen growing use as a proppant in recent years. Proppants are used in the hydraulic fracturing process to "prop" open rock fissures allowing natural gas or oil to flow out. Bauxite is sintered in a rotary kiln in order to harden the material so that it can withstand the extreme pressures it will be subjected to.
