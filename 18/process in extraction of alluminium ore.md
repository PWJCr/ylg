## Aluminum Extraction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In the electrolytic extraction of aluminium, the anodic process is the discharge (or oxidation) of the oxide ion, O 2−. The net process is the decomposition of the feed alumina, Al 2 O 3, into aluminium metal and oxygen, which in turn reacts with the carbon (anode) to produce CO 2 at elevated working temperatures (e.g. 900 °C). The process

Bayer Process. The second step is known as the Bayer process, which involves a combination of a chemical extraction and a mechanical separation to extract alumina (the base from of aluminium) from the bauxite. In the first step of the process, the alumina is released from the bauxite when it is crushed and dissolved in sodium hydroxide.

Firstly, aluminium has to be removed from the Earth, by mining. This is relatively simple, given the abundance of Aluminium. However, Aluminium is always bounded to other elements, and exists as compounds, often containing oxygen and silicon. Thus, it is impossible to obtain a pure substance of aluminium through mining. Aluminium's ore is bauxite.

## Aluminium Metallurgy - Chemistry LibreTexts
Introduction. Aluminum is too high in the electrochemical series (reactivity series) to extract it from its ore using carbon reduction. The temperatures needed are too high to be economic. Instead, it is extracted by electrolysis. The ore is first converted into pure aluminum oxide by the Bayer Process, and this is then electrolyzed in solution in molten cryolite - another aluminum compound.

## Aluminium production process
The ore is loaded into autoclaves and treated with lime-caustic soda. Aluminium oxide appears in the resulting slurry while all the admixtures settle to the bottom as red mud.  The process where the aluminium is shaped to its required form. This process is used for making the vast majority of aluminium products from spectacle frames

## Extraction Aluminium Mastering
Aluminium is the most abundant metal on Earth Despite this, it is expensive, largely because of the amount of electricity used up in the extraction process Aluminium ore is called bauxite The bauxite is purified to yield a white powder, aluminium oxide, from which aluminium can be extracted The . equipment used in the extraction of aluminium
