This paper describes a micro grinding method using a Poly Crystalline Diamond (PCD) micro tool scanning on a high accuracy 3 axis machine platform. An accurate tool can be shaped using micro EDM. The EDM process can produce many tool shapes, therefore complex three dimensional microstructures can be realized.

Aug 20, 2014· Single crystal diamond tools can be easily ground by choosing a direction of easy abrasion, but grinding a PCD tool imposes serious difficulties as the grains are randomly oriented. Ground surface defects such as micro-grooving, edge chipping, cracks and gouge marks are often observed while grinding the PCD tools with diamond wheel.

Oct 24, 2011  Micromachining is a very useful processing method and it has been carried out to  principle, the manufacturing is carried out on a desktop micro machine developed by NEU[8].  Diamond CVD is a method to fabricate micro shaft grinding tool, which . micro diamond grinding tool by compound process.

## Development of a micro diamond grinding tool by compound process
The developed micro-tool is utilized to machine hard and brittle materials, such as optical glass, fine ceramics, and tungsten carbide, and for micro-cutting or nano-grinding ( Gatzen and Maetzig, 1997 ). To increase the strength of the proposed micro-grinding tool, the tool shaft is made of tungsten carbide in ultra-fine particles.
