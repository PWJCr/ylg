## Milling Cutters & Tools - Types and Their Purposes (with  - Dosope
One of these automated fabrication methods is CNC milling. It is a process where rotary cutters remove material, which makes it the opposite of CNC turning. The milling centres do not just perform the cutting automatically, but also the changing of tools. During the average process of creating a finished product from a block of metal, for

## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.

Milling Machine Classification. In general terms, milling machines can be classified by the orientation of their spindle (or spindles, in the case of multi-spindle machining centers). In most cases, this is either horizontal or vertical, although the line has grown increasingly blurry with the development of 5-axis machining centers, so-called

These two types of machine are fairly similar, the main difference is the vertical machine's spindle has a vertical orientation as the name suggests. It's good for plunge drilling and cutting. A horizontal mill has the cutter or cutters located on an arbor. This type of machine is good for heavy cutting like slots and groves for instance.

A square shoulder milling cutter may be the best choice. But in other cases, the standard 45° face milling cutter may benefit more. When the cutting angle of the milling cutter is less than 90°, the thickness of the axial chip will be smaller than the feed rate of the milling cutter due to the thinning of the chip.
