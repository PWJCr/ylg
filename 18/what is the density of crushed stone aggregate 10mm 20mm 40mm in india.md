The base layer of a gravel driveway should be much larger than the gravel you'll use for the middle and top layers. Base gravel is typically #1 crushed stone, where pieces are angular and close to the size of baseballs. The base layer gives the middle and top layers a foundation they can somewhat settle down into rather than washing away.

Example calculation. If we want to find out how much gravel we need for an area 15ft long by 20ft wide, with a gravel depth of 3 inches. Our calculation might look something like this: volume = length × width × depth. volume = 15 × 20 × (3/12) = 75 feet³. cubic yards = 75/27 = 2.78 yd³ . weight = cubic yards × density (tons/yd³).
