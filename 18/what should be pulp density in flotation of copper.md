## Effect of Pulp Density on Gold Flotation Recovery
Quite simply stated, if the pulp density is not maintained at 30% or higher by weight, it is very difficult to keep the coarser free gold into the froth phase. Copper sulfate is often used as an activator for promoting free gold flotation. Often in plants using CuSO4, it has been this author's experience that this activation has not been

## Pulp density and adjustment in flotation plant
Sep 7, 2021Pulp density refers to the content of solid mineral particles in the pulp. There are usually two ways to express: (1) liquid-solid ratio, indicates the ratio of liquid to solid weight (or volume) in the pulp, sometimes also known as dilution; (2) percent solid content (%), indicates the percentage of solids by weight (or volume) in the pulp

The pulp density for grinding is generally in the range of 60% to 70% solids, depending on the ore's pulp viscosity and the specific gravity of the dry solids. The ground pulp should be wet screened on a 200 mesh (74 µm) or 325 mesh (44 µm) sieve and the oversize and undersize (slimes) material filtered and dried separately.

## How Does Pulp Concentration And pH Affect Froth Flotation Process?
When the ore is roughed, the pulp concentration is 25% ~ 35%, and the flotation fine particles and the ore with high mud content is 10% ~ 20%. When the flotation density of the mineral, the material particles are larger, the use of thick pulp. When the flotation density is small, the mineral of fine grain and slime material is used thinner pulp.
