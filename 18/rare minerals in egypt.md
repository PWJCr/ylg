The term "rare metals" refers in this work to metals with a low availability in natural. Based on their chemistry, rare metals were classified into; 1) rare earth elements (La-Lu), 2) trace elements (Nb, Ta, Mo, Cu, Ni, Co, Sn, W, V), 3) noble elements (Au, Ag, and PGE) and 4) fissionable elements (U and Th). In Egypt, rare earth elements occur in the phosphorites, monazite and granites

## Rare Rocks and Minerals (Part 1)
Langite [Cu4 (SO4) (OH)6+2H2O] is a rare hydrated-copper sulfate mineral, formed from the oxidation of copper sulfides. Named after the physicist and crystallographer Viktor von Lang, Langite was first discovered in Cornwall, England, in 1864. Though an uncommon find, Langite is a widespread secondary mineral, possibly of post-mine formation.

Apophyllite was originally regarded as a single mineral, with a variable ratio of fluorine to hydroxyl. In 1978, the IMA sub-classified into two distinct minerals: Fluorapophyllite and Hydroxyapophyllite. In 1981, an additional rare member with sodium replacing the potassium was added to the group, and called Natroapophyllite.
