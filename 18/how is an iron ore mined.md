Elemental iron has crucial functions in mammalian cells. Iron enables the function of vital iron- and haem-containing enzymes, including mitochondrial enzymes that are involved in respiratory complexes, enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and the cell cycle, detoxifying enzymes such as peroxidase and catalase, and many more 1.Therefore, iron is essential for cell replication, metabolism and growth.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
