## Peer-to-peer file sharing
Peer-to-peer file sharing is the distribution and sharing of digital media using peer-to-peer (P2P) networking technology. P2P file sharing allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content. The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers

## Query Processing in Mobile Peer-to-peer Networks
Mobile local search is a procedure in which a mobile user searches for local resources, i.e., resources that are in geographic proximity to the user (e.g., a person with certain expertise in a convention hall, a ride-share opportunity, a taxi-cab, a parking slot, etc.). A promising approach to mobile local search is mobile peer-to-peer databases (MP2PD). In the MP2PD approach, a database is

Bitcoin (Abbreviation: BTC; sign: ₿) is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

## Processing of Query in Peer to Peer Networks
ABSTRACT DHT based peer to peer network system is a general range of query scheme. These schemes can support the range of query without modifying the underlying DHTs and they cannot guarantee to return the query results with bounded delay. The query delay in these schemes depends on both the scale of the system and the size of the query space.

A Peer sends the specified query to process to get the answer from other peer. It sends the query through the selected intermediate system. Intermediate system will pass that query to that particular node through specified path. It will receive the query send by the sender node through intermediate system.

Decentralization. By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally. The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.One risk of a lack of decentralization is a so-called "51% attack" where a central entity can gain control of more than half of a network and can manipulate

In mobile ad hoc peer to peer (M-P2P) networks, since nodes are highly resource constrained, it is effective to retrieve data items using a top-k query, in which data items are ordered by the score of a particular attribute and the query-issuing node acquires data items with the k highest scores.

## query processing in peer to peer networks wikipedia
In this project an efficient query processing scheme is proposed to limit the search space of the given query by a domain based query routing mechanism which limits the search to related peers. Therefore, the mechanism consists of domain based architecture for grouping peers in the network into domains based on their contents.
