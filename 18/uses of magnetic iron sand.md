Magnet Release (, Jiton, Viz: Magnet Style) is a nature transformation kekkei genkai, suggested to be a combination of wind and earth. Magnet Release users generate a magnetic force which they apply to other substances for various purposes. Iron Sand was used by the Third Kazekage of Sunagakure. He modelled his use of Iron Sand after the sand controlled by Shukaku's jinchūriki, moulding

## Why Use Magnetic Separator for Iron Separation From Sand
Why Use Magnetic Separator for Iron Separation From Sand . Low Cost Magnetized iron sand separators are relatively inexpensive. The "drum" style separator is the most popular. In the drum model, a stream of black sand is dropped onto the outside of a magnetized metallic cylinder or drum. Only the strongly magnetic particles stick to it.

## Ironsand
Ironsand, also known as iron-sand or iron sand, is a type of sand with heavy concentrations of iron.It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour. It is composed mainly of magnetite, Fe 3 O 4, and also contains small amounts of titanium, silica, manganese, calcium and vanadium.. Ironsand has a tendency to heat up in direct sunlight, causing temperatures high enough to cause minor burns.

Sand that has iron sulfate or iron fillings such as magnesite will have magnetic properties. However, sand that does not contain these compounds won't be magnetic.

The underflow slurry of the desliming cone passes through the drum magnetic separator and the high gradient magnetic separator in turn. The field strength of the drum magnetic separator is 0.1-0.5t, which is mainly used to remove the strong magnetic minerals in the quartz sand and the mechanical iron in the processing. online message get quote
