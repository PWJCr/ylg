The main reason for the unification of Germany by 1871 was 'coal and. iron.'. This includes important factors such as the presence of raw. materials in Prussia, the development of the railways and the. Zollverein in Germany, and the industrialisation, which took place in. Prussia, particularly in the 1850s. This economic strength, stems back.

## Industrial Revolution | Growth of Manufacturing | Invention of the 
Spread of the Industrial Revolution . The Industrial Revolution began in Britain for a number of reasons.First, the country had raw materials, like iron ore and coal.Other materials, like cotton came from overseas colonies. By the end of the 18 th century the country became the world's largest colonial power.The colonies then became big markets for the industrial goods that Britain produced.

## And Coal And Iron Ore In Britain
Aug 01, 2013 In Britain, iron ore was found embedded with coal seams= same area provided both iron ore + coal; During that era, to process 1 tons of iron ore, you needed 8-12 tons of coal. Railway engines were also inefficient. So, weight-wise, it was cheaper to transport iron ore to coalfields rather than transporting coal to iron ore site.

The UK exported 0.6 million tonnes of hard coal in 2018. Coal consumption in 2018 was 11.9 million tonnes, of which 6.7 million tonnes were used for electricity generation, with the iron and steel industry being another large consumer. The residential heating market is now less than 0.5 million tonnes per year.

The British iron age ran from around 800 BC until the invasion by the Romans in 44 AD who brought with them the technology to make steel, though this new tech took years to spread around the country. Before the Iron age was the bronze age, a time when the hardest metal that people could work with was a combination of tin and copper.

These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.
