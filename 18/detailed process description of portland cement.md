## What is Cement? History- Chemistry- Industries - Civil Engineering
History- Chemistry- Industries. Cement, one of the most important building materials, is a binding agent that sets and hardens to adhere to building units such as stones, bricks, tiles, etc. Cement generally refers to a very fine powdery substance chiefly made up of limestone (calcium), sand or clay (silicon), bauxite (aluminum) and iron ore

## Detailed Process Description Of Portland Cement Cement
The Manufacture of Portland Cement. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS Portland cement is made by heating raw materials rich in oxides of silicon, calcium, aluminium and iron to temperatures of around 1200 1400oC. The chemical reactions that occur within the partially molten mass result from the formation of the four main cement.
