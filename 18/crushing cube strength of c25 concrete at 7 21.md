## Crushing or Crush Concrete Cubes or Cylinder at 28 days
Commonly, it has 60 mega pascals of specified strength. When you crush concrete cubes, the result should be equal to or more than 60 Mpa. The specified strength should be achieved at a test age of 28 days but sometimes we experience failure results at 28 days. That's the reason we have spare cubes or cylinder samples.

Calculation. Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load / Cross Sectional Area. Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 150mm = 22500 mm2 or 225 cm2. Assume the compression load is 450 KN, Compressive Strength = (450000 N / 225)/9.81 = 204 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N.

## Concrete test cube manufacturing and curing procedures
The cube strength of concrete is specifi ed by a structural engineer and is assessed by crushing concrete cubes at a specifi ed age (28 days after casting). Early strength may also be assessed at 3 or 7 days after casting. The preparation, handling, curing and testing of concrete cubes are done according to SANS 5861-3: 2006 Concrete Tests

As it appears, there is no linear relationship between the cube strenth and the cylinder strength. However, some times, it can be observed that some designers use 0.8-0.9 factor to get the relevant cylinder strength for a particular cube strength. Now, we need not worry about any factor to calculate the relationship the characteristic stress.

## compressive strength of c25
Class M30 C25/30 as per British Standards is the concrete having a characteristic compressive cube strength of 30 N/mm2 The same concrete would have a characteristic strength of 25 N/mm2 at 28 days if cylinders were used for testing, as in certain European countri

## Compressive Strength of Concrete | Cube Test, Procedure, calculation 
The Concrete Cube Test will give compressive strength of concrete which gives an idea of all the properties of concrete. By this unique test, we can decide whether the concreting was done correctly or not. The compressive strength of concrete ranges from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) for residential concrete and is high in commercial
