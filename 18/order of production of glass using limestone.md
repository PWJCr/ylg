##  Sector Study - PACRA
The production of glass requires materials such as Silica Sand (Silicon Dioxide), Limestone (calcium carbonate), Soda Ash (sodium carbonate) and waste glass (obtained through recycling of used glass). Soda ash reduces the melting point of sand and thus re duces energy consumption.

Unusual glass containers are still sometimes made by "blowing" them. A "gob" (lump) of molten glass is wrapped around an open pipe, which is slowly rotated. Air is blown through the pipe's open end, causing the glass to blow up like a balloon. With skillful blowing and turning, all kinds of amazing shapes can be made.

The glass is made by heating ordinary sand (which is mostly made up of silicon dioxide) until it melts and turns into a liquid. Sand melts at a high temperature of 1700°C (3090°F). In a glass plant, sand is mixed with waste glass, limestone (calcium carbonate), and soda ash (sodium carbonate) heated in a furnace.

Limestone also helps to improve the handling and formability of the molten glass.
