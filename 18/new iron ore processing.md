Steel is made from iron, which comes from iron ore, which is a combination of iron oxides (Fe x O y) and various mineral components. The current method for processing iron ore is by melting it in a blast furnace, causing the iron oxide to separate from the other parts of the ore. Hot oxygen interacts with coal in the furnace to create carbon

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Taconite Iron Ore Processing: National Emission Standards for  - US EPA
A taconite iron ore processing facility separates and concentrates iron ore from taconite, a low-grade iron ore, and produces taconite pellets, which are approximately 60 percent iron and about Â½ inch in diameter. These pellets are then utilized, mainly, in blast furnaces making iron and steel and in the cement industry. Rule History

## Iron Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC Machine
The former mainly selects magnetite ore, and the latter is mainly used for sorting hematite, mixed iron ore and weak magnetic ore. 6.2 Magnetic separation - cation reverse flotation process The grade of iron concentrate increased from 65.55% to 38.89%, the silica content decreased from 8.31% to 3.90%, and the iron recovery rate was over 98.5%.

## Microwave Processing of Low-Grade Banded Iron Ore with Different 
The current study investigates the effect of microwave processing on low-grade banded iron ore using charcoal, coking coal, and non-coking coal. Charcoal showed better microwave heating response at low temperatures, and the coals exhibit better heating response at higher temperatures. Low carbon dosage ~ 12% is sufficient to generate concentrate with 61.8% iron grade and ~6% for 94.8% iron
