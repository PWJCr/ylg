Manganese dioxide is an example for a heterogeneous catalyst, i.e. the phase of the catalyst is different from that of the reaction mixture. The surface of solid manganese dioxide provides a particularly favorable environment to catalyze the decomposition, though the mechanism is not understood very well.

## Nitrogen dioxide
Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO 2.It is one of several nitrogen oxides. NO 2 is an intermediate in the industrial synthesis of nitric acid, millions of tons of which are produced each year for use primarily in the production of fertilizers.At higher temperatures it is a reddish-brown gas. It can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities.

Manganese is an essential trace metal that is not as readily oxidizable like iron. Several bacterial groups posses the ability to oxidize Mn effectively competing with chemical oxidation. The oxides of Mn are the strongest of the oxidants, next to oxygen in the aquatic environment and therefore control the fate of several elements.

## The reactivity of manganese dioxide towards different substrates in 
The reactivity of manganese dioxide in organic solvents was studied by reacting commercial manganese dioxide MnO 2 with different substrates. The reaction of MnO 2 with arylimino, indolinonic and quinolinic aromatic nitroxides gave quinoneimine N-oxides via an electron transfer process followed by oxygen transfer. A reduction potential of 0.9 V vs. NHE was roughly estimated for manganese

## process of manganese dioxide reduction
Manganese Oxides: Battery Materials Make the Leap to  manganese oxide (typically in the γ-MnO 2 form) serves as the active cathode material, and stores charge via the insertion of protons from the aqueous electrolyte, accompanied by reduction of Mn sites in the oxide by electrons from the external circuit, a complex process that can be represented by the simplified equation below (Eq. 1).
