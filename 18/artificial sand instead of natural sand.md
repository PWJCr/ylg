## Appraisal of Artificial Sand Concrete | Semantic Scholar
Conventionally concrete is a mixture of cement, sand and aggregate. The large variation in the strength of concrete is due to the variation in the strength of aggregates used. There is a scarcity ofnatural sand due to heavy demand in the growing construction activities. This necessitates that a suitable substitute be found. The cheapest substitute for natural sand is obtained by crushing

Artificial sand refers to river gravel, pebble and other ore crushed by Jaw crusher, Impact crusher, cone crusher, and then screened by sand vibrating screen system, and ultimately got rock particles with particle size less than 4.75mm. Compared artificial sand with natural sand, the rough appearance and shape is the main difference.

## DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFILL FOR ARTIFICIAL TURF - ProGreen
Be aware of the different levels of this product. The silica sand infill normally used on landscape artificial turf lawns is #20 Clean Silica Sand. The #30 Silica Sand has slightly smaller granules, and we mainly recommend this size for sand-filled putting greens. Silica sand infill is great for front and back yards that are not used by pets.

## Difference Between Artificial Sand And Natural Sand
Artificial Sand vs. Natural Sand. Manufactured in factory. Naturally available on river banks. The shape of crushed sand is cubical and angular and has a rough texture and hence better for concrete. Smoother texture with better shape. Demands less water. Higher concrete strength compared to river sand used for concreting.
