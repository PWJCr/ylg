## What Is The Density Of Quarry Dust
Properties of cold bonded quarry dust coarse aggregates. Sep 01, 2015 The physical properties of quarry dust are given in Table 2. The specific gravity of the quarry dust is 2.74 and artificial aggregate made using quarry dust is therefore expected to fall under the category of normal weight aggregates.
