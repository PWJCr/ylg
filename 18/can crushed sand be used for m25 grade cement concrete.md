## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
It's recycling! Recycling crushed concrete to be reused helps reduce landfill crowding AND saves more resources from being used to create new concrete. Old concrete can be crushed down to specific sizes, cleaned so that unwanted debris is removed from the mixture, and reused as a solution to a number of construction and landscaping problems.

The mix proportions ratio of concrete details the proportion of cement, sand and water it needs to make that particular strength of concrete. For example M20 grade of concrete is the mix ratio 1:1.5:3. The "1" is cement, "1.5" is fine aggregate and "3" is coarse aggregate. This mix applies to all grades of concrete.
