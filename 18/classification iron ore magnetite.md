## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Nov 9, 2021An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.

## Iron - Minerals Education Coalition
Iron is the third most common element making up the Earth. Iron is one of the three naturally magnetic elements; the others are cobalt and nickel. Iron is the most magnetic of the three. The principle ores of iron are hematite (70% iron) and magnetite (72% iron). Taconite is a low-grade iron ore, containing up to 30% magnetite and hematite.

The geochemical analysis also showed that the deposit contained a very good metal grade iron ore with an average composition of 2.55 PPM of magnetite and also an average composition of 1.6PPM.
