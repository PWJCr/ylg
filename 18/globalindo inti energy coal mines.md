## Phasing out coal - World Energy Outlook 2021 - Analysis - IEA
Global unabated coal use in the energy system falls by around 5% to 2030 in the STEPS, by 10% in the APS, and by 55% in the NZE. However, managing the move away from coal is not simple, especially when it proceeds at the speed required in the NZE where all unabated coal power generation stops by 2040.

## Coal mine waste gas - Clean Energy Regulator
The coal mine waste gas method applies only to underground coal mines. The method sets out criteria for projects that reduce emissions either through flaring, oxidation, destruction, or conversion of waste gas to operate an electricity production device. These projects have a significant abatement effect as coal mine waste gas is primarily methane.
