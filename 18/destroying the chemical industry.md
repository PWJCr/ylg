## Destroying Chemical Weapons - Waste Management - United States
The destruction of chemical warfare material is prominent in the news today due to the documented use of sarin (i.e., isopropyl methyl phosphonofluoridate) by the Syrian government against its own citizens and the United Nations' resolution requiring the immediate destruction of these weapons.Unfortunately, Syria is not likely to be the only example of the need to demilitarize the chemical

## How to destroy a 'forever chemical'
The most common method of destroying PFAS is incineration, but most PFAS are remarkably resistant to being burned. That's why they're in firefighting foams. PFAS have multiple fluorine atoms attached to a carbon atom, and the bond between carbon and fluorine is one of the strongest. Normally to burn something, you have to break the bond
