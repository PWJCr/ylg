## Valspar single stage paint
Valspar SPRALAC (SP150) is a cost effective single stage polyurethane paint enamel that gives outstanding gloss, depth, chemical resistance, and durability. This mixed paint formula uses Valspar Refinish toners along with the Spralac SP150 single stage binder. 4:1:1-2 mixing ratio. In general, the suggested Valspar hardener mix ratio can be 8oz to a gallon or 4oz to 1/2 gallon, 2oz to a quart.
