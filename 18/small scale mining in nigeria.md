## Ghana and Nigeria pursue Ethiopia's financial model on small scale 
This model is what Ethiopia has been practicing, and was adopted by Nigeria. Though a recent entrant in the small scale gold mining space, the Federal Government of Nigeria in 2020 begun the process that made the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to start buying all the gold from local miners at an international price.

##  Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining in Nigeria - ELI
Unlike countries such as Ghana and Burkina Faso, Nigeria does not have a well-developed large-scale mining sector, and the majority of gold mining in the country is carried out by artisanal and small-scale miners. Artisanal mining activities in Nigeria are almost by definition informal - that is, operating outside current laws and regulations.
