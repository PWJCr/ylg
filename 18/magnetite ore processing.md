## Eco-efficient and cost-effective process design for magnetite iron ore 
The cost associated with high-capacity processing of a hard, fine-grained, silica-rich magnetite ore is presented in this paper, with the emphasis on comminution circuit options. The objective is to evaluate several options involving different grinding technologies with respect to energy consumption, operating cost and capital cost.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)Â·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

IMP Technologies (IMPTEC) has anticipated the need for a dry low cost processing alternative which can open the way for the development of lower grade magnetite deposits and ensure the sustainability of processing in Australia. The lower grade magnetite deposits are generally fine grained and require grinding to p80's of 30 to 40 microns.

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How ores are being extracted? When miners find rock containing mineral ore they first extract the rock from the earth. . The rock is then crushed by powerful machinery. Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smelting or electrolysis. Smelting uses heat to separate the valuable metal from the rest of the ore.

A process for upgrading low-grade magnetite-containing iron ore with minimum fine grinding. The dry ore is first comminuted to between about three-fourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated. The dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.

## Magnetite Concentration Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
Magnetite (composition Fe3O4) has a specific gravity ranging from 5.0 to 5.1, and is sufficiently heavy to permit of its concentration from gangue by specific-gravity methods, which have had an extensive application. The object of the separation, however, is twofold: the concentration of the mineral in the raw ore to a product of sufficient

## Trends in Magnetite Ore Processing and Test Work - AusIMM
Beneficiation of magnetite is an integral part of the future of iron ore processing. Historically, the focus of Western Australian producers has been on exporting direct shipping ore (DSO) namely haematite. The future for new DSO resources is limited so companies are changing their emphasis into processing the very large, undeveloped magnetite ores in Western Australia (WA), using
