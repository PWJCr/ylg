## Ball Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
14.7 Use of ball milling. Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles []. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.
