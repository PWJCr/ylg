the diatomaceous earth (DE) mining and process-ing industry. Diatomaceous earth is a mineral derived from the skeletal remains of diatoms that are deposited on marine and lake floors. Exposure to amorphous (non-crystalline) and crystalline sil-ica, in the form of quartz, occurs from open pit mining of DE.

## How to Apply Diatomaceous Earth - Indoors and Outdoors
Diatomaceous earth works by absorbing the fats in oils in a bug's exoskeleton. This will cause the bug to dehydrate and die. It is effective on cockroaches, crickets, ants, bed bugs, ticks, fleas, spiders, and other common pests. In addition, diatomaceous earth can also be found in skincare products, toothpaste, rubber, paints, and even medicine.

diatomaceous earth, also called Kieselguhr, light-coloured, porous, and friable sedimentary rock that is composed of the siliceous shells of diatoms, unicellular aquatic plants of microscopic size. It occurs in earthy beds that somewhat resemble chalk, but it is much lighter than chalk and will not effervesce in acid. Under a high-powered microscope the form of the diatoms can be distinguished.
