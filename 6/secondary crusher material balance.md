 · Jaw crusher units with extra-long, articulated crusher jaws prevent coarse material from blocking while moving all mounting elements of the crusher jaw from the wear area. A more even material flow may be affected if the transfer from the prescreen or the feeder trough is designed so material simply tilts into the crushing jaw.

## Understanding the Different Types of Crushers | Agg-Net
An impact crusher uses mass and velocity to break down feed material. First, the feed material is reduced as it enters the crusher and makes contact with the rotating blow bars or hammers in the rotor. Secondary breakage then occurs as the material is accelerated into the stationary aprons or breaker plates.

Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor crusher or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that

## Perfecting the Performance of Secondary Crushers | E & MJ
The feed size to a secondary crusher is typically in the range of 50 mm to 250 mm (up to 300 mm). If the capacity is higher, the acceptable feed size gets larger. After crushing, the product is in the range of 0-60 mm (75 mm) diameter.

## All crusher types for your reduction needs - Metso Outotec
Gyratory crushers are frequently used in the primary crushing stage and a little less often in in the secondary stage. Gyratory crushers have an oscillating shaft. The material is reduced in a crushing cavity, between an external fixed element (bowl liner) and an internal moving element (mantle) mounted on the oscillating shaft assembly.
