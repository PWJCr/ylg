Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Beneficiation of manganese ores with particular reference to the 
tunately iron and silica percentages are increased at the same time, and sintering, apart from meeting sizing requirements, is only of real value with carbonate ores. METHODS OF TREATING MANGANESE ORES The milling and beneficiation of manganese ores has only recently, with the depletion of the high-grade ores, assumed commercial importance.
