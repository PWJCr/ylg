##  Energy optimization in cement manufacturing - ABB
Thermal energy savings using Expert Optimizer (EO) Cement manufacturing is a complex and energy-intensive process. A key stage in this process is the conversion of ground raw materials (CaCO 3, clay and/or shale) into clinker (synthetic cementitious minerals) in the kiln. A typical operation uses kiln exhaust gases to preheat the raw materials

## energy balance in cement
The cement industry is an energy intensive industry consuming about 4 GJ per tonne of cement produced. A thermodynamic analysis for cogeneration using the waste heat streams is not easily available. Data from a working 1 Mt per annum plant in India is used to obtain an energy balance for the system and a Sankey diagram is drawn.

## The cement industry is the most energy intensive of all manufacturing 
The industrial sector, which encompasses manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and construction, accounted for almost a third of total U.S. energy use in 2012.Energy-intensive manufacturing accounted for a little more than half of total industrial energy use. Although the cement industry used only one-quarter of one percent of total U.S. energy, it is the most energy-intensive of all
