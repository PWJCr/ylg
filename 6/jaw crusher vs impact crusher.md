It can be seen from the use of jaw crusher is a first-level crushing equipment for materials, and the impact crusher is a second crusher or a third crusher. It is processed so that the particles of the finished product are smaller than the broken jaw, which can also be seen from the difference in the position of the two in the production line;

For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

## jaw impact crusher line | Primary Hard Stone Crushing Machine Jaw Crusher
The Difference Between Jaw & Impact Crusher. The jaw crusher works as a curved extrusion, the material is squeezed and crushed in the crushing chamber composed of moving and fixed jaw plate. The impact crusher works as impact crushing, the material is repeatedly impacted and broken between the rotor (board hammer) and the impact plate.
