## Fieseler Fi 156 Storch - Free Flight Archives
In flight, the main landing gear legs hung down, giving the aircraft the appearance of a long-legged, big-winged bird, hence its nickname, Storch. With its very low landing speed, the Storch often appeared to land vertically, or even backwards in strong winds from directly ahead. Starting with the C-2 variant, the Fi 156 was fitted with a

The ungainly bird plopped down on a boulder-strewn patch in under 100 feet—at that altitude!—then spirited Il Duce away, ripping off a gear leg in the process. "Storch" is German for stork.
