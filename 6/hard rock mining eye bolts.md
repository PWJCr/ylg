## MINING AND HARD ROCK - SlideShare
MINING AND HARD ROCK 1.  Grouting for rock bolts is typically applied in two steps. In the first step, the grout or resin is injected into the base of the bore hole — the section known as the "bond length" of the bolt — and allowed to set. After the bond length is dry, the bearing plate and hex nut are installed, the boltis tightened

Over the years, a variety of methods have been developed to achieve rock reinforcement and area ground support. One of the most cost effective and efficient of these is the use of cable bolts (sometimes also called long tendons). The use of grouted cables was originally introduced in mining to reinforce the backs of cut and fill stopes.
