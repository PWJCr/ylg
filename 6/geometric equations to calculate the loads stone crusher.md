Either of the following 2 equations can help us to calculate the Mechanical Advantage(MA) of a lever. i) MA of lever = load / effort. First, we need to measure the load overcome by the lever and the effort applied to it. And then we need to calculate the ratio of these two parameters to calculate the mechanical advantage of the lever.

With a little algebra, you can rearrange the geometric growth equation to find r: Pt / P0 = (1 + r) ^ t . 1 + r = (Pt / P0) ^ (1/t) . r = [ (Pt / P0) ^ (1/t)] -1 . If you recall that an exponent of 1/x is equivalent to taking the xth root, you can understand that an exponent of 1/2 is equivalent to taking the square root.

## Geometry Formulas - Toppr Bytes
The main thing every student needs to know about this subject are the Geometry Formulas. Geometry Formulas are crucial elements to calculate the perimeter, length, area, and volume of geometric shapes and figures. There are loads of geometric formulas that are concerned with height, length, width, radius, perimeter, area, volume or surface area

## Ultimate crushing stress in terms of crushing load Calculator
The Ultimate crushing stress in terms of crushing load formula is defined as a special type of localized compressive stress which occurs at the surface of contact of two members that are relatively at rest and is represented as σ c = P c / A sectional or Column Crushing stress = Crushing load / Column Cross Sectional Area.Crushing load is the intensity of load required to crush the material
