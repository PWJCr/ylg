What is Pyrite. Commonly called fool's gold, pyrite is the Earth's most abundant sulfide mineral. Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore.

## Pyrite is found on your property ? | Bisson Expert
Pyrite is a mineral (FeS2) found in the backfill material used during construction. When it comes into contact with moisture and oxygen, a chemical reaction produces sulphate and can turn it into gypsum, and crystallisation can cause the stone to shatter. Expansion then occurs, also causing the concrete to expand and crumble.

## 11 Minerals that are NOT AS TOXIC as they say! Find out inside!
Pyrite (FeS 2) is a relatively common mineral, often colloquially known as Fool's Gold because of its brassy appearance. Pyrite is included on lists of toxic minerals because it might contain small amounts of arsenic. Yes, pyrite can contain some arsenic, but since pyrite is not soluble in water or hydrochloric acid it poses no risks when

Is pyrite dangerous? Yesterday i bought a generous chunk of pyrite stone and put it on my shelf (that is in my head level when im sitting). Ive read that the stone can release dangerous elements like arsenic and sulfuric acid. Id like to hear more about that, it really stresses me out! Sorry for misspelings! not my first language.

Pyrite. Commonly called fool's gold, pyrite is the Earth's most abundant sulfide mineral. Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore.
