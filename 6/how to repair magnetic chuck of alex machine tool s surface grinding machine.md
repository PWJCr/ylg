## Magnetic Chucks Selection Guide: Types, Features, Applications 
There are three magnetic chuck types - permanent, electromagnetic and electro-permanent. Permanent magnetic chucks are manufactured from magnetized materials and exhibit a constant magnetic field without needing to introduce an electric current. Because these materials are highly magnetized materials, they do not lose their magnetic force.
