## Extraction of Metals: Methods, Processes Involved, Minerals, and Ores
The processes used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed. 1. Extracting Metals Low in the Reactivity Series. Metals low in the activity series are very unreactive.

##  Extracting a metal from its ore
Aluminum, calcium, sodium and other active metals are extracted using electrolysis. Copper can be extracted from its ores by reduction. One of the common copper ores, malachite, which is composed of mainly copper carbonate, CuCO3xCu(OH)2, is heated to produce copper oxide with the release of carbon dioxide. CuCO3xCu(OH)2 → 2 CuO + CO2 + H2O

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.
