As an example, a conveyor needs to move a load of 20 kg at 500mm/s up a 10 degree incline. The conveyor must occasionally be able to accelerate the mass at 0.5m/s^2. The width of the belt conveyor is 457mm. In this case our variables are 20kg for mass, 0.5m/s^2 for acceleration, 10 degrees for angle theta, and 120N for deformation force.

The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.
