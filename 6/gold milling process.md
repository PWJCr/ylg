## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
The process produces gold of up 99.5% purity. A repeat of the process may further improve the purity of gold produced by this method. Gold smelting is an important process in the production of gold. It enables gold miners to separate impurity materials from pure gold that is desirable in the market. Smelting often produces gold to the purity

## gold mill process
Gold is processed by cyanide milling a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore. It is then refined to the gold standard purity according to Mineweb. Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process. Chat Online

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as dorÃ© - typically containing between 60-90% gold.
