## USA - Method of increasing fine coal filtration efficiency 
Fine coals suspended in a coal flotation froth are more efficiently filtered when the flotation froth is subjected to a thickening operation prior to filtration. The thickening operation is accomplished by the use of a clarifier or thickener. USA - Method of increasing fine coal filtration efficiency - Google Patents

## Modeling of fine coal flotation separation based on particle 
Flotation is a complex multifaceted process that is widely used for the separation of finely ground minerals. The theory of froth flotation is complex and is not completely understood. This fact has been brought many monitoring challenges in a coal processing plant. To solve those challenges, it is important to understand the effect of different parameters on the fine particle separation, and

Coal is a great source of energy gifted by the nature. Main hazard in the use of coal is the production of sulphur oxides, sulphur dioxides, and nitrogen oxides which affect the climate severely. To protect environment from these hazardous oxides of sulphur, clean coal technology is being introduced and applied all over the world.

If coal is sufficiently crushed to fine particles, then the mineral particles can be fully dissociated from the coal. Such condition is favorable to the separation process. Fine coals are currently separated mainly by flotation, which can effectively separate <0.5 mm fraction coal [ 7 - 9 ].

The products from the separators are passed over spraying screens (one shown) and the resultant effluent is treated by "Sub - A" Flotation Machines for the removal of fine coal. Without this flotation step, the fine coal would upset the specific gravity range of the natural media and create a large circulating load of coal fines in the media.
