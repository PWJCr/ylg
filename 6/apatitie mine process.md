The rock nelsonite containing ilmenite and apatite was first identified in this area as early as 1890. Although some ilmenite-rich ore samples were mined and processed in Richmond, and there are records of subsequent mineral prospecting in the area, the site was abandoned and no further mining occurred (Watson and Taber, 1913). contact us
