## Which green sand properties should you control per molding equipment 
Composition of green sand molding mixture for iron foundries typically consists of 100 parts silica sand, 8 parts bentonite clay and other additions like carbon ( 0,3 parts ) or cereals and 3 % water content. It's called " green" because the mold strength is developed with mechanical (compression) stress; not by a chemical reaction nor heat.

## Sand casting
Sand casting, also known as sand molded casting, is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material. The term "sand casting" can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries.Over 60% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Everything you need to know about sand content: what it does and how to 
What sand content affects. Running a high sand content affects the properties of the mud, but it also affects the mud pump, drill and downhole tooling. "It is like sandpaper on a piston," explained John Cope, Vermeer applications engineer. "A high level of sand content can make packings leak and attack the swivel.

## New Shell Sand Improves Core Production - Foundry Management & Technology
Not only are the cores critical to Tyler Pipe's product quality, but because the plant operates 26 shell-core machines, the large volume of shell-core sand it uses represents a considerable expense. In October 2005, the supply contract for resin-coated sand came up for renewal, and the plant's managers decided to consider new supply sources.

##  THIS MACHINE MAY LARGELY INCREASE WORLD'S GOLD OUTPUT - Elmer Gates
The iron removed from the sand in the manner described is an exceedingly valuable by product, being so pure that it may take the place of hematite iron ores, which, at present, we are obliged to import from Spain for making the best quality of steel. Our own iron ores make brittle pig iron, whereas magnetite affords a malleable iron.
