## Blasting Methods in Mining and Quarrying - GRT review
Apr 1, 2021In opencast mines, both vertical and inclined holes are parallel to the bench face. For staggered patterns, the row of the holes may be a single row blasting pattern or a multiple-row blasting pattern. In single row blasting, the fragmentation is low and the explosive consumption may be more than multi-row blasting.

## Coal mining
Coal that occurs at depths of 55 to 90 m (180 to 300 ft) are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of 60 m (200 ft) are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam 20-25 metres (60-90 feet).
