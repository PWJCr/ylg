I did however fall in love with reefing and currently have a 90g reef tank. In my quest for a koi pond, I've made a some-might-say impulse purchase and personally imported from holland (I live in Israel) a RDF filter. It's a 30k Liter per Hour RDF filter with an attached 200 liter fluidized bed chamber. Here's a link to the manufacturer's

The new aqua drum filters have three operating modes: 1. Automatic - the cleaning of the filter unit is performed by means of the measurement of the water level inside the drum filter, 2. Timer - the timer is set for drum filter cleaning, and, 3. Manual - the operator decides on the frequency and duration of the rinsing.
