## Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences
In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap. This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.
