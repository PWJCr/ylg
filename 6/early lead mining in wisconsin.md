Home to a University of Wisconsin campus, this area has a deep mining history that drew immigrants from across Europe. Starting in the mid-1840s and going well into the 1970s, this area was rife with lead and zinc mining. Today, you can visit a fascinating museum that's preserved this history and even head down into an abandoned mine.
