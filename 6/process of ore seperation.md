## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
Process water is used to assist the separation process. The heaviest particles are separated from finer particles by centrifugal force. A collector at the bottom of each spiral collects the heavy concentrate (so-called hematite concentrate) and eliminates the lighter unwanted particles (middlings and tails). This step is repeated two or three

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
After the iron ore has been prepared by crushing and grinding during ore extraction, the ore is actually processed. The aim of this is to reduce the undesirable high proportion of admixtures to a desired minimum in order to increase the iron content. This is done by processes such as flotation or magnetic separation.

## Different types of separation methods for minerals
Mineral processing is the first step for ore once it leaves the mine. The process involves ore preparation, milling, and ore dressing, commonly known as beneficiation. Beneficiation mechanically separates the grains of ore minerals from the gangue (low value) minerals that surround them in order to produce a concentrate made up of useful minerals.

## Copper Ore Gravity Separation Process
This method can be used under suitable conditions. Copper Ore Gravity Separation Process can also be used for tungsten, tin ore beneficiation, ferrous metal ore beneficiation and so on. Copper ore is essentially copper oxide and copper sulfide, and flotation is often used, but for coarse-grained copper ore, gravity beneficiation is more popular.
