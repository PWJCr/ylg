## The Expanding Role of EPS in Construction - Green Building Solutions
Air barriers provided by the EPS insulation and concrete eliminate convection currents, while the high thermal mass of the concrete walls buffers a home's interior from extreme outdoor temperatures. The result is a 25-50 percent energy savings over traditional stud-wall or steel-framed homes. Sound-deadening walls.

## Best innovative and modern Building construction materials list in 2020
Modern construction materials or new construction materials are building materials that are human-made and invented recently. Most importantly, these materials have no connection with the past human civilizations and have origins ultimately. This time is an anticipated era of construction and gaining good momentum! This time is the 21st century.

Bricks were widely used from the 1700s to the 1900s because they were fairly cheap to produce, but they weren't resistant to earthquakes.. In modern times, to prevent brick buildings from falling, architects reinforce them with steel rods.. Masonry most commonly finds its use in foundations, gabion construction, walls, fireplaces, and decorating finishes.

## Introduction to Modern Materials - Research and Development in Modern 
Scientists and engineers invent new materials. Research by scientists leads to the discovery and creation of new materials, and engineers design the processes which produce these materials, and many of the products which are made from them. In designing new products, engineers constantly look for ways to improve performance.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Modern construction materials are those that can be found in high-rises, airports, and in the world of construction itself. These materials are sturdy and durable, yet are lightweight enough to be created with a minimal amount of manual labor or specialized tools. Steel is perhaps the most common building material used today.

## Top Sustainable Construction Materials to Build a Better Future
One of the things that often comes up when discussing the future of construction is sustainability. The building sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), with occupied buildings being responsible for nearly 40% of global GHG emissions, according to Architecture2030.. Sourcing and manufacturing building materials also contribute a great deal to climate change.
