8.2.3.1 Open pit mining. Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

The gold mine pit was depleted of ore adjacent to other ongoing nearby active mine pit operations by 2003. In 2004, the bottom portion of the 500-1,700ft (m) deep mine pit was backfilled to above the existing groundwater conditions with a low permeability clayey waste rock site grading fill in preparation for geomembrane liner placement.

9.2 Open Pit Mines. At the end of an open pit operation, sump pumps and/or dewatering wells are decommissioned. The geometry of the pit and the void volume may be modified if partially backfilled with mine waste. Following cessation of pumping, in most climatic regimes, both surface water and groundwater will inflow to the pit, creating a pit
