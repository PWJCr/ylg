## What is the difference between eccentric and concentric reducers?
While this may seem complicated, it's actually quite simple. Concentric reducers reduce the pipe in the center. So, if you're looking at the reducer head-on, you can see the smaller section is formed in the direct center of the larger side. Eccentric reducers reduce the pipe to the side.

More seriously, imagine two different diameters of pipe laid horizontally end-to-end, and joined with a reducer. A concentric reducer tapers equally in all directions, like a cone, with the center lines of the two pipes at the same height throughout. An eccentric reducer is flat on one side, with all the taper on the other.

## What Are Eccentric Reducers and Concentric Reducers?
A pipe reducer is one of pipe fittings, which is used to joint pipes of different diameters. Generally, it is divided into the eccentric reducer and the concentric reducer.An eccentric reducer is a reducer whose center is not on the same straight line. Different from the eccentric reducer, the concentric reducer has a common center line. The commonly used forming process is diameter reduction

## What is the Difference between Concentric vs Eccentric Reducer?
Pipe reducers are one of the various types of fittings available for controlling flow in a pipe system. There are two types of reducers in a plumbing system: concentric and eccentric reducers. We'll go through both types of reducers, what they are, and why they might be useful. Pipe reduction (and expansion) is, for the most part, uncomplicated.

What is the difference between eccentric reducer and concentric reducer? Concentric reducers reduce the pipe in the center. So, if you're looking at the reducer head-on, you can see the smaller section is formed in the direct center of the larger side. Eccentric reducers reduce the pipe to the side.

## Concentric vs. Eccentric Reducer: When to Use Which?
Sep 17, 2020The cone-shaped concentric pipe reducer means the pipes have matched center lines, and the eccentric reducer has mis-matched center lines. Both of these have a consequence regarding flow. Most reducers are going to be concentric. Eccentric reducers are used when the pipes have to maintain the same top or bottom level.

## Why concentric reducers are not used in pump discharge lines?
In the past the theory was that pump suction reducer should be eccentric flat on top. But the expert Igor Karassik after his several tests up to1995 before his death at84 years old he agreed that if the supply source was from above the pump, the eccentric reducer should be installed with the flat (horizontal) surface at the bottom.

## The Difference of Concentric Reducer and Eccentric Reducer
The eccentric reducer pipe is conducive to fluid flow, and changing the diameter has less interference with the fluid flow pattern. Therefore, concentric and eccentric reducer pipes are used in liquid pipes containing gas and vertical flow. Eccentric reducer pipe fitting is a kind of pipe fitting suitable for different pipe diameters.

Concentric vs Eccentric Reducers | Ducting Express. Concentric reducers are used where the pipework is vertically installed and at the discharge side of pumps. Eccentric reducers are more often used when the pipework lays on a pipe rack. Because of the flat side, aligning and securely mounting the pipes to the rack is easier.

## What is the difference between eccentric and concentric reducers 
Concentric reducers are resistant to weak corrosive media such as air, steam and water. The two ends of eccentric reducers have different diameters, and eccentric reducers are used for connecting pipes with different diameters or flanges.
