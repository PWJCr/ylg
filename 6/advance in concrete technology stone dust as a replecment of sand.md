## Pour concrete over wet claynclub.pl
Concrete should be left for 24-48 hours to dry enough to walk or drive on it. However, for it to fully develop and reach its maximum strength it will take up to 28 days. Adding more concrete to wet concrete could affect the mixture by making it too wet, which may cause cracking.

## A review on Properties of Sustainable Concrete using granite dust as 
Granite dust is a waste produced during cutting and grinding process of granite stone. The waste generation from granite stone industry is in the form of non-biodegradable fine powder, the utilisation of this waste in concrete will help in sustainable and greener development.. Published literature shows huge potential of granite dust as a replacement of natural fine aggregate.

1. They're Fine. Both polymeric sand and stone dust are very fine materials. Exactly how fine stone dust is, however, depends on the exact stone dust you get, as some may be finer than others. However, generally speaking, both feel more like a powder than they do like sand, stone, or grain. 2.

## advance in concrete technology stone dust as a replecment of sand
Stone dust improves pozzolanic activity in concrete along with filling voids by better pack-ing and improves concrete durability.The fineness modulus of rock dust is in the range of 2 to 2.2 as compared to 2.4 to 2.6 for fine sand. This study aims at using stone dust as partial replacement of sand in concrete to study its effects on

## Partial Use of stone dust in concrete as an alternative of sand
Crusher stone dust can be an economic alternative to the river sand. Crusher stone dust is produced during crushing of stones into aggregates of desired size say 10mm, 20mm etc. These dusts are generally used in making blocks or land filling. It has potential to be used as partial replacement of natural river sand in concrete.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of stone dust in concrete 
Answer (1 of 6): Stone dust - if you are talking about the finer particles than 150 micron - it is not recommended to use in concrete. Almost everywhere, concrete is done using crush stone sand. Cement is normally passing through 90 micron. Dust have particles finer than 90 micron. Some have
