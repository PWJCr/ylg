It was not until about 1200 BC that iron became general for the production of tools because the temperatures needed to process the ore exceeded what most ancient kilns were able to reach. Pure iron has a melting point of 1,535°C. The limit of an ancient furnace was about 1,150°C. (Recall, by contrast, that copper has a melting point of 1,083°C.

## What is the purpose of refining process? - Vanessa Benedict
Purify the gold and silver. In order to extract the pure silver, these ores have to undergo a refining process. Bronze Age people achieved this by heating the silver ore and blowing air over it, a process called cupellation. The silver does not react to the air, but the base metals such as lead and copper oxidize and separate from the silver.

## Cupellation and the Birth of Precious Metal Refining
The cupellation process is one of the best ways to extract these precious metals. It starts with the construction of a cupel, a small bowl that will contain the alloyed metals throughout the process. The cupel must be made of porous, calcified material so it can absorb lead without causing a reaction. The alloy is placed in the cupel and heated.

## Refining (metallurgy)
The Pattinson process was patented by its inventor, Hugh Lee Pattinson, in 1833 who described it as "An improved method for separating silver from lead". It exploited the fact that in molten lead containing traces of silver the first metal to solidify out of the melt is lead, leaving the remaining liquid richer in silver.

## silver processing | Britannica
For the recovery of New World silver, the Patio process was employed. Silver-bearing ore was ground and then mixed with salt, roasted copper ore, and mercury. The mixing was accomplished by tethering mules to a central post on a paved patio (hence the name of the process) and compelling them to walk in a circle through the mixture. The silver was gradually converted to the elemental state in a very finely divided form, from which it was dissolved by the mercury.

The result of this process is 99.5 percent pure gold. The final step is to cast the gold into electrodes or anodes and place them in an electrolytic cell. The refiners will then pass an electric current through the cell. At the end of this process, the gold will be 99.99 percent pure.

## How silver is made - material, making, history, used, processing, industry
The ManufacturingProcess. Silver was first obtained in sixteenth-century Mexico by a method called the patio process. It involved mixing silver ore, salt, copper sulphide, and water. The resultant silver chloride was then picked up by adding mercury. This inefficient method was superseded by the von Patera process.

## Silver Mining and Refining | Education
Lead ores containing silver are extracted by cupellation, a process developed by the Chaldeansas early as 2,500 B.C. Today, the cupellation process involves heating crushed ore on a porous bed of bone ash until it melts. The lead and other impurities are absorbed into the bone ash, and the molten silver is drawn off.
