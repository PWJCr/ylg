There are two main types of drilling mud that are produced and land applied: water-based mud (WBM) and oil-based mud (OBM). The main difference between WBM and OBM is the solvent (liquid) used as the "base.". For WBM, the solvent is water and for OBM it is diesel. WBM is more common and is typically utilized in the shallow (0 to 3,000 feet

## What Is Drilling Mud And How It Is Used? - Oil and Gas Overview
Drilling mud or drilling fluid is an important component of almost any drilling operation. Mud is mixed in special surface pits and then pumped through the drilling string into the well. After exiting through the nozzles on a drilling bit, mud returns back to the surface through the annulus between the drill string and wellbore.

## Ditching the Mud: Your Guide to Drilling Mud Disposal - Trenchlesspedia
Disposing of drilling fluid at landfill or state sites is costly. These costs vary significantly from place to place but can be in the order of $600 for every 1,000 gallons of drilling fluid. Haulage is another significant contributor to disposal cost. Dumping drilling mud at landfill sites far from the construction activity uses a lot of fuel.
