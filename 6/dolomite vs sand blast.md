Calcite also forms flat, rhomboid "poker chip" crystals, but dolomite does not. Calcite responds vigorously to acid, while dolomite responds less vigorously.

Calcite and dolomite are very similar minerals. Both have the same hardness (H = 3), the same rhombohedral cleavage, and are found in identical geologic settings. The best way to tell one from the other is the acid test: a drop of 1 M HCl on calcite produces an instant, obvious fizz; a drop on dolomite produces slow or no obvious bubbling.
