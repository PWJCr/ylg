4. Uses of Coarse Aggregate. The uses of coarse aggregate are: 1. It is used for providing volume to the concrete which reduces the cost of the project. 2. It helps to boost the crushing strength of concrete. 3. It is used in the railway ballast which helps in the uniform distribution of load.

## What is Crushed Aggregate? (with pictures)
Impact crushers are used to created crushed rock aggregate. The different aggregate sizes and types are appropriate for specific uses in the construction and landscaping industries. For example, although the larger, coarse crushed aggregates are more economical, this type of aggregate can present problems if used in concrete forms for upright structures.

From left to right: manufactured sand of 1-1.25 mm and 4-5 mm, fine aggregate of 10-12.5 mm and 20-25 mm. The general idea is that the smaller the aggregate size, the more we need equipment to produce it. Production of aggregate starts typically from 800 mm pieces of blasted material. One crusher can only reduce the size by a certain amount.

Aggregates are, for the most part, base or subbase aggregate materials, which range in sizes from 1 ½ inch (37.5 mm) in diameter to particles as fine as dust. These sizes are controlled by screening and blending operations at the aggregate producer's crushers and/or at the central mix aggregate pugmill mixers.
