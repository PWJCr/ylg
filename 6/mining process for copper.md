## How Is Copper Mined - Realonomics
The laborious task of mining copper ore by hand made it difficult to obtain large quantities for production. During the Industrial Revolution coal- and steam-powered machinery paved the way for a huge increase in copper production with mines smelting between 200 and 300 tons of copper ore per week. Where is copper found naturally?

## Mining and Water Pollution — Safe Drinking Water Foundation
Waste from the Mining Process. Ore is mineralized rock containing a valued metal such as gold or copper, or other mineral substance such as coal. Open-pit mining involves the excavation of large quantities of waste rock (material not containing the target mineral) in order to extract the desired mineral ore.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).
