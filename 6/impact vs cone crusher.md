## What is the difference between Impact Crusher and Cone Crusher?
Cone crushers can be used in the primary, secondary, and tertiary position. These crushers are available in stationary, track and mobile designs. Cone crushers are also used in the steel furnace slag industry, which is a much more abrasive slag than blast furnace. Impact crushers, initially, are less expensive than cone crushers.

## Cone Crusher Vs Impact Crusher - What Are Their Differences
The hardness of the materials that are crushed by cone crushers and impact crushers is also different. Cone crushers are mainly used for crushing materials with a higher hardness. These. materials often include river pebble, tuff, basalt, granite, etc. Impact crushers are mainly used to crush materials that are softer and brittle, like limestone.

## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.
