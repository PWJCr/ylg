Comments Off on Iron: Health and Environment Effects. Iron is the tenth most abundant element in the universe. But from micro-organisms to human iron is most essential to survive.  China, Australia, Ukraine, Russia and Brazil are the main mining areas for iron. Every year more than 100 billion tons economically reserves iron ores exceed 100

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

Carajás is an open-pit mine, in which minerals are removed from the surface one layer at a time. In 2007, 296 million metric tons of iron ore were pulled from the mine. The mine is estimated to contain about 18 billion tons of iron ore, plus gold, manganese, copper, and nickel. The Carajás Mine sits in the Carajás mountain range (Serra dos

Falling iron ore prices can reduce household income, and therefore household expenditure, through several different channels. Lower resource equity prices and/or dividend payments reduce household wealth and income, although this effect is mitigated to some degree by the high level of foreign ownership of iron ore companies.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.
