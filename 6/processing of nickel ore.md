Copper Solvent Extraction. The separation of copper from nickel is based on the fact that there is an appreciable difference in the pH at which the two metals are extracted. Copper can be extracted, with very small amounts of nickel, at pH 6.0 to 6.5, while nickel is extracted from the copper raffinate at pH 8.0 to 8.2.

Ores Sulfides. Canadian ores are sulfides containing nickel, copper, and iron. The most important nickel mineral is pentlandite, (Ni, Fe) 9 S 8, followed by pyrrhotite, usually ranging from FeS to Fe 7 S 8, in which some of the iron may be replaced by nickel. Chalcopyrite, CuFeS 2, is the dominant copper mineral in these ores, with small amounts of another copper mineral, cubanite, CuFe 2 S 3.

Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature; the others are iron, cobalt and gadolinium.Its Curie temperature is 355 °C (671 °F), meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.

Credit: BHP . BHP Nickel West's idled Kambalda concentrator has sprung back to life after processing the first parcel of ore from Mincor's restarted nickel operations in the area. The news marks the first processing operations at the refurbished BHP facility since it was placed on care and maintenance in 2018 after IGO closed its Long nickel.

The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a

## Preconcentration strategies in the processing of nickel laterite ores 
The preconcentration of nickel (Ni) laterite ores ahead of Ni recovery by hydrometallurgical processing makes good economic sense. Since Ni-bearing minerals are often finely disseminated through laterite ores, liberation of minerals either high and/or low in Ni content is a prerequisite prior to any form of separation process.

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Nickel Laterites—Mineralogical Monitoring 
Nickel laterite ore is used to produce nickel metal, predominantly to manufacture stainless steel as well as nickel sulfate, a key ingredient in the batteries that drive electric vehicles. Nickel laterite production is on the rise and surpassing conventional sulfide deposits. The efficiency of mining and processing nickel laterites is defined by their mineralogical composition.
