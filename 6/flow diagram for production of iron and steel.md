The overall reaction for the production of iron in a blast furnace is as follows: (23.3.1) F e 2 O 3 ( s) + 3 C ( s) → Δ 2 F e ( l) + 3 C O ( g) The actual reductant is CO, which reduces Fe 2 O 3 to give Fe (l) and CO 2 (g) (Equation 23.3.1 ); the CO 2 is then reduced back to CO by reaction with excess carbon.

## USA - Process for the production of pig iron and sponge iron 
A process for producing pig iron is described, which contains a reducing shaft furnace 1 and a melting gasifier 2. The sponge iron produced from iron ores in the reducing shaft furnace is supplied to the melting gasifier and converted there into a pig iron melt. The gas produced in the melting gasifier is supplied directly via a line 4 as reducing gas to the reducing shaft furnace.

Gas based process is simple to operate and involves three major steps namely (i) iron ore reduction, (ii) gas preheating, and (iii) natural gas reforming. Presently the gas based process is also available in which the reforming of natural gas is not needed. The heart of the gas based process is the shaft furnace.

But in today's time, the modern process is used in the production of steel. They are categorized into two types: 1.Primary process: In primary process, the liquid iron is converted into steel using blast furnace. 2.Secondary process: In secondary process, this requires refining of crude steel before casting. In this, alloying agents are added.

To produce steel first the iron ore is heated and melted in a furnace. The impurities are then removed from the molten iron. Carbon and other required alloying elements are added to make steel. Modern-day steel making is highly improved and specialized. There are two processes that are widely popular for modern-day steel making. They are:
