trials were carried out by using Ramco Super Grade cement (PPC) and different types of fine aggregates i.e. River sand, M-Sand and CSS. Basically the percentage of fine aggregate in the total aggregate was fixed based on the fine aggregate gradation, fines content (<75microns) and other physical properties.

## Comparing the Compressive Strengths of Concrete Made with River Sand 
Nowadays development of infrastructures is becoming number one priority in the world, particularly in the developing countries. So there are great demands within the construction industries for river sand as fine aggregate used in the production of concrete. This has created a very difficult situation; the cost of river sand has increased and also there is great fear from environmentalist and

Fine aggregates, generally known as sand, plays a vital role in concrete and mortar. It should be free from silt and impurities. Use of sea sand causes corrosion of reinforcement. In case of dame sand, upto 15% extra sand is to be added to compensate for Bulking. Manufactured sand be used but crusher dust should be avoided.

The surface area of coarse aggregate is less than fine aggregates. 6: Function in Concrete: The voids between the coarse aggregate are filled up by fine aggregate. Coarse aggregate acts as inert filler material for concrete. 7: Uses: Fine aggregates are used in mortar, plaster, concrete, filling of road pavement layers, etc.

The aggregates passing 4.75 mm tyler sieve and retained on .075 mm sieve are classified as Fine Aggregate. Types of Fine Aggregate. Usually, sand, crushed stone, and crushed bricks are used as fine aggregate in concrete or pavement construction. Sand. Sand is an important engineering material. In concrete works, sand is used as a fine aggregate.

## Optimising concrete with recycled sand, aggregates - Quarry
LOGICAL ANSWER. To combat depleting natural sand and aggregate resources we should better utilise the abundant incoming CD&E waste stream. In its appraisal, concrete produced from recycled sand and aggregates is unfairly pitted against higher strength concrete produced using virgin aggregates, such as granite or basalt, and natural sand.

## Aggregates - Types of Aggregates | Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate
Aggregate is a granular material, such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, crushed hydraulic-cement concrete, or iron blast-furnace slag, used with a hydraulic cementing medium to produce either concrete or mortar. Those particles that are predominantly retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve, are called coarse aggregates. Those particles passing the 9.5 mm (3/8 inch)

## Fine and coarse aggregates in construction aggregates
Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. Sand, natural gravel, and crushed stone are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air

Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

1.Size of fine aggregates: The largest size that falls under the limit of the exact set is 4.75 mm. Using the largest size will give more dense concrete, but a mixture of all sizes is more desirable and more economical. If cement mortar is prepared for masonry work or plastering work, very fine types of sand of similar size is used.

## Suitability of Ambo Sandstone Fine Aggregate as an Alternative River 
The most commonly used in construction is a fine aggregate from river sand or pit sand. Fine and coarse aggregates constitute about 75% of total concrete by volume. It is, therefore, essential to obtain right type and best quality aggregates at sites, because the aggregate forms the main components of the concrete mixture or mortar 3.
