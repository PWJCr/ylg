2022. 7. 31. · Several things can be done if your air conditioner isn't cooling. First, make sure the thermostat setting is on "cool" and that the desired temperature is lower than what is currently present in this room. Next, try changing the batteries if that doesn't work, especially if the thermostat screen is malfunctioning.
