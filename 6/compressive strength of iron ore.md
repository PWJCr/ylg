## Compressive Strength Iron Ore
The compressive strength of the concrete with iron ore tailings after freezing-thawing was approximately 90% that of the reference concrete; hence, the compressive strength of the tailing mixes after freezing-thawing had some degree of discount When used in buildings with antifreeze requirements, the concrete needs to be combined with an air

## compressive strength iron ore
The addition of iron ore tailings enhances the compressive strength and impermeability of UHPC mortars due to the filling effect of IOT and the pozzolanic reaction of part of the finer IOT when the substitution rate is no more than 40%. The replacement ratio of 40% shows the best results, with low permeability and the maximum compressive strength.
