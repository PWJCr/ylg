When iron production virtually ceased in 1910, less than 700,000 long tons of ore had been processed. The World War II demand for iron and steel stimulated production; small amounts of ore were mined until 1943, when more modern plants were constructed and production revived.

Raw iron producers are major greenhouse-gas pollutants. The CO 2 footprint of a pig-iron plant is mainly governed by the overall oxidation state (Fe 2+ /Fe 3+) of iron in the ore. The oxidation state determines the amount of reducing agent (coal) in raw iron production and is obtained from the mineralogy of the ore.

## What is Concentration of Ore? Definition, Physical & Chemical Methods 
The ore concentration is defined as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals. In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.

## Iron Ore Washing Plant Ore Washing Equipment
In the mineral processing line, all kinds of ores need to go through crushing, grinding, grading and washing before they can enter the steps of gravity separation, flotation, magnetic separation and electrical separation to separat the useful minerals from gangue minerals. The ore washing machine played an important role in this process.
