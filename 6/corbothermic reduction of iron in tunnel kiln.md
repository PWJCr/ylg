## Carbothermic Reduction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Carbothermic reduction is the most widely used process for preparing nitride fuel. The starting material is a dioxide and carbon, and the general reaction is expressed as [I] where M represents an actinide element, such as U and Pu. The mixture of dioxide and carbon is heated in N 2 gas stream, usually at K.

## Carbothermic Reduction of Nickeliferous Laterite Ores for Nickel Pig 
Both the consumption and production of crude stainless steel in China rank first in the world. In 2011, the nickel production in China amounted to 446 kilotons, with the proportion of electrolytic nickel and nickel pig iron (NPI) registering 41.5% and 56.5%, respectively. NPI is a low-cost feedstock for stainless steel production when used as a substitute for electrolytic nickel. The existing
