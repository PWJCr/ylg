In refining copper, the metal is melted down in a reverberatory furnace in a more or less oxidizing atmosphere and then further subjected to an oxidizing smelting in order to eliminate the common impurities, most of which have a stronger affinity for oxygen than has copper.In these operations some of the copper is oxidized to cuprous oxide and dissolved by the metal bath.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

## Copper Tailing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
As copper tailings appear in ground form, the grading of copper tailings reported by Gupta and Thomas (2013) and Nitish et al. (2013) has a sizeable silt fraction of 0.06-0.002 mm. Copper tailings are considered to be finer than CS, which usually has a dominant sand fraction. Table 6.5 compares the geotechnical properties of copper tailings to those of CS, which have been reported in this
