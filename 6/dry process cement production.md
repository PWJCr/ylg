## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

At present, about 78% of Europe's cement production is from dry process kilns, a further 16% of production is accounted for by semi-dry and semi-wet process kilns, with the remainder of European production, about 6%, coming from wet process kilns. The wet process kilns operating in Europe are generally expected to be converted to dry process

## Dry Process Of Cement Manufacturing - Dry Cement | AGICO
With the development of the construction industry, the cement production process is also constantly improving. The new dry-process cement production line technology was developed in the 1950s, so far, the new dry process cement equipment rate of Japan, Germany, and other developed countries have accounted for 95%. This cement production process regards the suspension preheating and pre decomposition as the core, and has the advantages of small pollution and a high degree of automation.

## Dry And Wet Process Of Cement Manufacturing
basic methods to produce cement are the wet and dry manufacturing processes. The main difference between wet and dry process is the mix preparation method prior to burning clinker in the kiln. In the wet process water is added to the raw materials to form a raw thick slurry whereas the dry process.
