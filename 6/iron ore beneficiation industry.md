## India's beneficiation of low-grade iron ore could result in new trade 
An iron ore industry source in Singapore has doubts about India being a sustainable long-term supplier of high-grade iron ore. "There are costs involved in this. For example, new capital expenditure to set up beneficiation and concentration plants, so it's not likely that every miner will be able to do it," he said.

Mining Industry Profile: Iron The Tilden Mine operation owned by the Cleveland-Cliffs Company is one of many facilities currently using cationic flotation as part of its iron ore beneficiation process (Nummela and Iwasaki 1986). Some of the reagents commonly used in the cationic flotation process are listed in Table 1-6 (Ryan 1991).

## Iron Ore Industry - Beneficiation Technology
Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total
