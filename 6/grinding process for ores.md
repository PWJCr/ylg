## crushing grinding of rock ores
The ore is conveyed, and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore. Following crushing through a jaw crusher (3), the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill (4) along with water and steel balls. The grinding process reduces the rock to a slurry. The SAG mill is a large revolving cylinder.
