The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

## Beneficiation Process Of Magnetite Ore
Magnetite Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Flow Chart. Extraction of iron from its ore, or extraction of iron, is a reletively simple separation process that concentrate iron content from the iron ores, as there are seveal different types of iron ore, so the iorn ore mining process is not all the same, for example, there are magnetite iron ore, hematite iron ore, and limonite iron ore, generally it.

## Beneficiation For High Grade Haematite And Magnetite
Beneficiation Of Iron Ores Ispatguru. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 70 iron hematite or Fe3O4 72 iron. magnetite.
