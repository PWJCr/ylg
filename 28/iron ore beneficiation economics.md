## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content.

Conventional beneficiation processes such as flotation, electrostatic and magnetic separation, gravity methods and flocculation-dispersion using chemical reagents to treat the finer iron ore resources often prove to be inefficient, energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally-toxic.

## Engineering Economy Analysis on the Production of Iron Ore in Nigeria
The Itakpe iron ore has an iron content of 35%, hence a 2.5 metric tonnes beneficiation plant was installed in 1991/1992, which was designed to produce and supply 2.15 million metric tonnes/yr of

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
The latter property aids in the beneficiation of magnetite ores. Magnetite contains 72.4% Fe by molecular weight, which is higher than hematite, but magnetite ores having lower ore grade (generally 20-30% Fe) owing to the presence of impurities.  Australia has the world's largest economic resources of iron ore with 29% of the global total
