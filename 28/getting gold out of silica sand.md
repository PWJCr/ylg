## Silica - the Most Abundant Element in Sand and Soil
After oxygen, silica is the most abundant element in sand and soil, and is found mostly as silicon dioxide. Part 1. In the soil, it helps seeds to germinate by breaking through their hard outer shell and, if soil lacks silica, very few seeds would sprout naturally. In biodynamics it is recognised as an essential mineral and is added to composts.

## 6 Methods for Removing Iron From Silica Sand | Mining Pedia
Flotation is mainly used to separate feldspar from silica sand, and can also be used to remove clay minerals such as mica and secondary iron from silica sand. The most typical process is to use hydrofluoric acid as the activator, and use an amine cationic collector for flotation under strong acidity (pH=2～3).

And a lot of aggregate comes out of deep flood plains that were once mined for gold. A lot of muck from hardrock mines and open pits are reclaimed for construction materials. Especially silica sand. So the chances of finding gold somewhere really odd do exist. Edited August 8, 2013 by Bedrock Bob
