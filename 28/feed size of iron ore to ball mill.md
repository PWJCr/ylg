## How Ball Mill Ore Feed Size Affects Tonnage & Capacity
Hard ore Work Index 16 = 100,000/65,000 = 1.54 kwh/t. For the purposes of this example, we will hypothesize that the the crushing index of the hard ore with the increased energy input of 1.54 kw/t reduces the ball mill feed size to 6,500 micrometers. As a result, the mill output will increase with this reduced size to approximately 77,000 tons

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

The dried material is fed to the ball mill for grinding. Concentrate/ground iron ore of typical size 80 % less than 45 microns (0.045 mm) with a moisture content of around 9 % is required for the pellet production.  For BF grade, fluxed pellets are produced with additions of limestone, dolomite, silica, etc. to the balling feed. These

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Feed Size VS Ball Size - Grinding & Classification Circuits 
For ball mill, Bond (1958) was proposing an empirical formula giving the top size of balls (make-up balls) DM function of the feed size xG (80% passing size - Âµm), the ore true specific gravity sg, the ore Bond Work Index Wi (kWh/st), the fraction of critical speed fc and the inside mill diameter D (m):

## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
