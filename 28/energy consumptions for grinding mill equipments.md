## Breaking down energy consumption in industrial grinding mills - CIM Store
Results showed that on average, 79% of the supplied electrical energy was converted to heat absorbed by the slurry, 8% was lost through the drive system, and approximately 2% was transmitted to the ambient air. Only 9% of the input energy was actually used for grinding.
