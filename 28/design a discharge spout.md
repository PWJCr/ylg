## Discharge Spout - LANDA
The discharge spout is your machine's last component. It guides the crop flow into the wagon. Therefore, it undergoes a heavy flow of coarse material that wears down its various plates. Neglecting to routinely inspect and replace these parts will reduce the overall productivity of your machine, even if its other components perform well.

## design a discharge spout
Design A Discharge Spout. Buckets are designed for gentle discharge; the buckets are closely spaced on the belt or chain to allow the material to flow over the backside of the preceding bucket, whose extended sides form a chute to guide the material into the discharge spout. read more

## EPA1 - Bulk bag with remote discharge - Google Patents
The discharge spout is folded against the bag and covered with a closure flap. A pull strap is connected to the flap.  A potential disadvantage of a bag of this design is the risk of inadvertent discharge if the pull strap is snagged and accidentally pulled during transportation or handling of the bag. U.S. Pat.
