## Weathering | National Geographic Society
Weathering describes the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on the surface of the Earth. Water, ice, acids, salts, plants, animals, and changes in temperature are all agents of weathering.Once a rock has been broken down, a process called erosion transports the bits of rock and mineral away. No rock on Earth is hard enough to resist the forces of weathering and erosion.

The artificial sand produced by proper machines can be a better substitute for river sand. The sand must be of proper gradation. When fine particles are in proper proportion, the sand will have fewer voids. The cement quantity required will be less. Such sand is more economical. Sand manufacturing is a profitable business.

There is a lot for work on metal binder jetting at the moment, but I am not sure the parts can be as robust as LPBF. Binder jetting can be very versatile in other applications as it allows a wide variety of materials compared to any other process. I don't see metal extrusion to be common on any type of high-end application at the moment.

## Chromium Speciation in the Size-Fractions of a Soil Polluted by 
The chromate ore process residues (COPR) polluted soil was physically separated into coarse sand (2.000-0.425 mm), fine sand (0.425-0.053 mm) and silt to clay (< 0.053 mm) fractions. The Cr speciation was characterized by synchrotron based micro X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) and micro X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (µ-XANES). The results indicated that Cr was bearing both in COPR parent
