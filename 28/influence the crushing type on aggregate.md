## Mechanical properties of concrete produced with recycled coarse 
The aggregates' shape and the crushing process are closely linked: type 1 aggregates, produced with a jaw crusher (primary crushing), have lower shape indexes than type 2 aggregates, which also used an impact crusher (secondary crushing), as shown in Fig. 2 (NATP1 and RATP1 versus NATP2 and RATP2).

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products - up to 40 mm in size.

## The influence of stone crushing processes on aggregate shape properties 
Aggregate shape properties have a direct influence on the behaviour of pavement materials. The crushing process is the main factor responsible for generating these shape properties; however, there has hardly been any effort directed toward optimising the performance of pavement materials by altering the crushing techniques to produce aggregate particles with desired shape properties.
