## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Purposes - JM Fertilizo
Dolomite serves as the host rock for many lead, zinc, and copper deposits. These deposits form when hot, acidic hydrothermal solutions move upward from depth through a fracture system that encounters a dolomitic rock unit. These solutions react with the dolomite, which causes a drop in pH that triggers the precipitation of metals from solution.
