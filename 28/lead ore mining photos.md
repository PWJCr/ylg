## Homestake Gold Mine - Lead Historic Preservation
The Homestake Mine was once called the "Richest 100 Square Miles" on the Earth. The original ore body was discovered in 1876, in Bobtail Gulch south of present day Central City, by the Manuel Brothers, Fred and Moses, Hank Harney and Alexander Engh.

During the CIVIL WAR, increased demand for lead drove the price per one thousand pounds of ore from $48.00 to $90. The Bonson-Waller smelter located in the Rockdale area was the last furnace to remain in operation. Photo courtesy: Bob Reding. With such huge production, the transportation of lead to market in St. Louis was very competitive.

By the boatload, settlers came up the Mississippi River to claim the rich veins, establish mines, build smelters and produce lead. Similar to the California Gold Rush of 1849, the Lead Rush brought throngs of people from the East coast and Europe.

In most lead-zinc mines, zinc is higher than lead. Most of the lead-zinc sulfide mine uses preferential flotation technology, "floating lead and zinc-suppressing", which is often reasonable both technically and economically. 2 Lead-zinc oxide ore In the lead-zinc oxide ore, lead is mainly present in the state of leucite and lead bismuth

The oxide lead ore in a dolomitic matrix may contain clay slimes and a fairly large amount of pyrite and barite; both of these minerals have a negative effect on oxide lead flotation. These ores may contain one or several lead minerals, including cerussite, anglesite and pyromorphite. Some lead oxide ore varieties may contain oxide copper
