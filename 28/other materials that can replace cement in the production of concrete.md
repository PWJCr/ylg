## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Therefore, apart from reducing the amount of CO2 in concrete mixes, proposals to decarbonise cement production focus on capturing CO2 so that it is not released into the atmosphere.

## Characterization of Fly Ash for Use in Concrete, HR-225, 1983
Recent construction of new generation power plants burning western coal within Iowa has resulted in fly Ash production on the order of 760,000 tons annually. Although fly ash has long been accepted as a valuable replacement for portland cement in concrete, most experience has been with fly ash generated from eastern bituminous coals. A few years ago, fly ash in Iowa was not a significant

The minimum depth of concrete removal for replacement concrete should be around 25mm and should extend till all the defective concrete has been removed. In case of a vertical member, the top of the hole should be cut in a 1:3 upward slope from the back toward the face from which the concrete will be placed. This is essential to permit vibration

## Sustainability of cement, concrete and cement replacement materials in 
About 20% of secondary materials are used in order to adjust the chemical composition of the cement, such as iron ore, bauxite, shale, clay or sand (source of silica, alumina and iron oxide). Step 2: Production of the clinker

## Could this revolutionary new material replace concrete?
But, thanks to an accidental discovery, a environmentally-friendly substitute to cement may be on the horizon. A recent report by PBS features the invention of environmental chemist David Stone: a cement-like material that isn't just carbon-neutral but actually carbon- negative.
