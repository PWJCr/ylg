## Iron Ore Distribution across the World - PMF IAS
Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

## Production of Iron ore in India, 2017 - 2025 (Million Tonnes)
India's iron ore production fell in 2020 in respect to 2019, mainly due to the decline in output from the country's largest-producing state of Odisha. The delay in the auctioning of mines in Odisha - which were to be held in March 2019 - due to the lack of clarity on the maximum lease area, impacted production in the state.
