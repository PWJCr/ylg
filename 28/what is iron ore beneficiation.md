## what is iron ore beneficiation
Iron ore beneficiation is a multi stage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine itThe beneficiation process can be defined as a

## Iron ore beneficiation technologies - GoodRich MAGMA
We offer dry beneficiation plants to up-grade the contaminated hematite iron ores. In the dry beneficiation process, iron ore is ground to 0-2 mm size. After screening, the fines are passed through a very high gauss rare earth magnetic separator (up to 8,000 gauss). A demo plant has been set up & experiments on many types of raw materials were

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total
