Grinding Wheel: Cutting Wheel: The grinding wheel has good strength which avoids cutting improper shape and size. The normal cutting tool doesn't have abrasive. So it will not provide better finishing accuracy as grinding wheel provides. The chances of wear and tear are high in cutting wheel : A grinding wheel having low chances of wear and tear.

## How To Select The Right Grinding Wheel - SANS
When using a grinding wheel, the abrasive grains cut into the material being ground, thereby removing unwanted surface material in small fragments. When choosing a grinding wheel, the three most important characteristics to consider are the type of abrasive, the size of abrasive grains (or coarse grains), and the type of bonding.

## Grinding wheel
Grinding wheels contains abrasive compounds for grinding and abrasive machining operations. Such wheels are also used in grinding machines.. The wheels are generally made with composite material.This consists of coarse-particle aggregate pressed and bonded together by a cementing matrix (called the bond in grinding wheel terminology) to form a solid, circular shape.

When the wheel is rotated at grinding speed and applied to the work piece, the abrasive grains cut the material that is being ground, removing the material in small chips. Under the action of forces improved during grinding, the abrasive cutting points are worn flat, resulting in the points becoming blunt.

Sep 7, 2021Conventional bonded abrasives include aluminum oxide grinding wheels and silicon carbide grinding wheels. Usually, the whole body will be formed with abrasive grains, bonds and other materials. The reason why most super hard abrasives use bodies is due to the diamond and CBN abrasive grains with a much higher cost than conventional abrasives.
