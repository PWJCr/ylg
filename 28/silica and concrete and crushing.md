Respirable crystalline silica consists of very small particles of silica (less than 10 m), at least 100 times smaller than ordinary sand found on beaches or playgrounds for example. Crystalline silica is created when cutting, sawing, grinding, drilling and crushing stone, rock, concrete,, block and morter. Get Price
