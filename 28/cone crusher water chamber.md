As the wedge inside the Cone Crusher rotates this cause the compression within the chamber resulting in the material to break down into smaller pieces as it goes down the wear liner. The crushed material then discharges from the bottom of the machine. In simple words cone crushers are designed to reduce the size of the raw material or feed.
