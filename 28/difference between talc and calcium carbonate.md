## Difference Between Talc And Calcium Carbonate
The difference between talcum powder and calcium carbonate: 1 Talcum powder is flaky in shape, so it has higher rigidity, dimensional stability, heat resistance temperature, and good reinforcement effect 2 Calcium carbonate is generally granular, so its stiffness and other aspects are not as good as talcum powder, but its price is lower, and
