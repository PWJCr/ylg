## Reducing Environmental Impacts of Cement and Concrete
About 1.6 tons of these raw materials are required to make 1 ton of cement. In 2009, over 78 million tons (71 million metric tons or mmt) of portland cement were produced in the U.S., and 3 billion tons (2.8 billion metric tons) were produced in the rest of the world. That's about 900 pounds (400 kg) of cement for every person on the planet.
