## Ion Exchange Method for Removal and Separation of Noble Metal Ions
1. Introduction. General characteristics of ion exchangers. Ion exchangers are high molecular substances, most frequently solid, organic or inorganic, insoluble in water and many other solvents and capable of exchange of their own active ions into those coming from the surrounding electrolyte. From the chemical point of view, they are polyacids, polybases or both polyacids and polybases

## Gold recovery with ion exchange used resins - ScienceDirect
The aim is to develop a fixed bed system using ion exchange exhausted resins from a water demineralizing system to treat gold electroplating effluents. The resins come from the three bed demineralizing station for water supply to an industrial oil plant. The first bed in the station is filled with a strong acid cationic resin of the gel type
