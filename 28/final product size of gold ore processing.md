## Topic 3: Ore processing and metal recovery - SlideShare
Alkaline cyanide solutions are used to extract gold from ores. Because the ores are finely ground (unlike heap-leaching), large quantities of fine tailings are produced and require storage in tailings dams. The tailings will be acidic in the case of copper processing and alkaline in the case of gold processing. 13.

The fluxes form a slag of impurities which is removed, leaving a bar which is a 99% pure melt of gold and silver. Each bar of doré bullion contains around 75% - 90% silver and 10% - 25% gold, and weighs approximately 20 kg. The bullion is sent to the Western Australian Mint in Perth, where it is further refined to separate the gold from the silver.

## Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings
