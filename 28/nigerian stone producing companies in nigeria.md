In the flour mills industry, almost 90% of the raw materials are imported because Nigeria's climate is not viable for production of wheat. Rising prices of wheat is therefore a major challenge being faced in the industry as a ton of wheat is currently priced at between $200 and $250. There are currently 21 flour milling companies in Nigeria.
