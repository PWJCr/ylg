## Kalimantan and Sumatra captive coal mines - Global Energy Monitor
Borneo and Sumatra are the third and sixth largest islands in the world, respectively, six times the size of Great Britain with some of the largest remaining tropical rainforests. The large open-pit coal mines operating and proposed on these islands are among the most environmentally and socially destruction mega-projects in the world

"There are hundreds of unexploited coal mines along the hauling road," Titan's Director Tjhie Sugianto said. He added that South Sumatra has abundant coal resources but less exploited due to the lack of supporting infrastructure such as hauling road. Titan is expected to finish the construction of the Servo hauling road by the end of 2016.
