## Is raw materials a fixed or variable cost? - Short-Fact
In economics fixed costs are just that, not dependent on production, for example rent is fixed, at least for a tear. Variable costs, such as energy, raw materials, vary according to the level of production. A business can carry on, at least for a while, not paying fully for it's variable costs.
