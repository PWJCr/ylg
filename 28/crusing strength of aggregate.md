## Influence of Crushed Coarse Aggregates on Properties of Concrete
From systematic and standardized investigation it is clear that, type of crushing aggregate has dramatic effects on properties of concrete. At 1 week and 4 weeks the strength fluctuation also obtained for five different groups. In all case, strength decreases in case of vertically shafted (A-2) coarse aggregates.
