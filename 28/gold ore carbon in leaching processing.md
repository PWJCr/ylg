This CIL method has high recovery rate and high degree of automation. Gold Carbon In Leaching leaching process is a process that adds activated carbon to the slurry and simultaneously leaches and adsorbs gold, which is the preferred process for modern gold ore dressing. Working Principle CIL is cyanide gold extraction process.

Carbon-In-Leach. Carbon-in-leach combines leaching with the carbon-in-pulp process, creating a single unit process operation. Usually this method is chosen when native carbon (a high organics load) is present in the gold ore, adsorbing the leached gold and preventing its recovery.

## Gold ore CIL process (carbon leaching method)-Materials-Henan Shunzhi 
Gold ore CIL (Carbon In Leach) process, that is, carbon leaching method for gold extraction, is a process of adding activated carbon to the pulp and leaching and adsorbing gold at the same time. Two steps are one step, reducing management costs while reducing losses. Compared with the traditional CCD process, it saves 66% of the investment cost.

## carbon in leach gold processing
How to Process Gold Ores by Heap Leaching Carbon . The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp circuits contaminants. These are removed by thermal regeneration of the eluted carbon, typically in a rotary kiln at temperatures of 650750°C. Regeneration is carried out in a steam atmosphere to minimize carbon degradation due to oxidation.

Reason#2: There are minerals such as carbon or graphite in gold ore. Some gold ores have active organic carbon or graphite, etc. Because the carbon contained in the ore has considerable activity, the phenomenon of "carbonaceous gold robbing" will occur during the leaching process. They will adsorb the dissolved gold and then precipitate it

Gold flotation. Flotation process is widely used for lode gold processing. In most cases, the flotation method has a good effect in sulfide-containing gold ore with high floatability. In addition, the flotation process is also used for polymetallic gold-bearing ores such as gold-copper, gold-lead, gold-copper-lead-zinc-sulfur ore.

Many opportunities exist throughout the world for small cyanide plants, possibly using a Gold Leaching Process, both for production and pilot operations, especially in areas not easily accessible, and where labor and local costs are on a level for profitable operation.Ores not fully amenable to treatment by amalgamation or flotation processes for the recovery of gold and silver can often be

## Lime use in gold processing - A review - ScienceDirect
Dec 1, 2021Heap leaching and dump leaching are well-known metallurgical processing methods used to extract gold from low-grade ore (Kappes, 2002). This method is typically used for ore containing <1 g gold per metric ton of ore where the contained gold value does not warrant the increased cost of milling, flotation and subsequent use of tank leaching
