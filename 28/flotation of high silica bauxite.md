The pH of bauxite residue was reduced during neutralisation by the transformation of hydroxide ions to (hydrogen) carbonate ions. Neutralisation at high CO2 partial pressures and high temperatures reduces the alkalinity of the bauxite residue, but it leads to the stabilisation of silicate compounds such as cancrinite and grossular.
