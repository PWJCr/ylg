## Laboratory Studies on Iron Ore Sintering and Testing
Some of the variables encountered in the sintering of iron ores and their effect on sinter properties have been investigated at the Jones and Laughlin Ore Research Laboratory in Michigan. Ores requiring agglomeration before blast furnace utilization may be classed as coarse, intermediate or fine. Coarse iron ore is considered similar to a —¼

## high efficiency iron ore testing machine for
Sep 23, 2019· Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50 needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding,ic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
