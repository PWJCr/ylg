## material for hammer of impact crusher
Hammer crusher mainly breaks materials by the impact of hammers. The material entered into the working area of the crusher is crushed by high-speed hammers. The crushed material obtains kinetic energy from the hammers, and then it impacts on the crushing plate and grate screen at high speed and is broken for the second time.

## What Are the Advantages of Impact Crusher?
Impact crusher is a kind of crushing machine that uses impact energy to crush materials. When the material enters the plate hammer area, it is crushed by the impact of the plate hammer on the rotor, and then it is thrown to the impact device and crushed again, and then it bounces back to the plate hammer area from the impact liner.
