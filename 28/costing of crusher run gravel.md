## Gravel under concrete footing - GreenBuildingAdvisor
Crusher-run gravel compacts well but does not drain very fast -- at least not as fast as 3/4-inch crushed stone (no fines). Talk to a soils engineer if you are worried -- but in my experience, either crusher-run gravel (compacted) or 3/4-inch crushed stone can be used under footings. So can rigid foam. An engineer may disagree.

Probably self compacting. #57, which is 1/2 to 3/4-inch gravel is generally considered to be self compacting. This is because there are no fines to inerfer with the movement, so it goes to where there is direct contact between the particles. Short of braking the rocks, which would require a great deal of force, the material won't get any tighter.
