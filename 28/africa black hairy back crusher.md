## Dealing with Back Hair - Removing the Problem - Professor's House
Shaving is a fairly painless, quick, inexpensive, do it yourself, non-permanent way to remove the hair. Tweeze it out! You could also use the old technique that is often used for removing eyebrow hair, called tweezing, where you use tweezers to remove your back hair. Again like shaving this would be very difficult to accomplish yourself.

These papillae, which are longer than normal, can easily trap and be stained
