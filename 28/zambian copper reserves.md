Zambia's economy is primarily reliant on copper mining, which generates over 70% of the country's revenue (Chipili, 2019). The two biggest copper mining companies in the Copperbelt are Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) and Konkola Copper Mines (KCM). These mines serve as a gauge for the minindustriesing and, by implication, the Zambian economy's health.

## Copper mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
There are 72 economic deposits of copper/cobalt and four large mining centers. Taken together, the DRC and Zambian copper belts are the second largest global reserve of copper, about 1/3 the size of the Chilean reserve. The DRC copper belt includes some of the highest grade copper deposits in the world. In some reserves the grades are above 5%.
