The flanging is also called perforation, which is to draw a slightly larger hole on a smaller base hole and then tap on the hole. This will increase the strength and avoid the screw from loose. Generally used for thin sheet metal processing. When the plate is thick, such as 2.0, 2.5mm, etc., we can directly tap the wire without turning it over.

The steps involved in the N-TUB fabrication process are as follows: 1. Wafer The silicon wafer is selected for doping p-type impurities on it. The doped wafer formed will be the p-type substrate with the trivalent impurities. 2. Oxidation of wafer The Silicon dioxide layer or oxide layer is created on the surface that protects the substrate.

Lithography. Lithography is a crucial step in the chipmaking process, because it determines just how small the transistors on a chip can be. During this stage, the chip wafer is inserted into a lithography machine (that's us!) where it's exposed to deep ultraviolet (DUV) or extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light. This light has a wavelength anywhere from 365 nm for less complex chip designs to 13.5

## Metal fabrication
Metal fabrication is the creation of metal structures by cutting, bending and assembling processes. It is a value-added process involving the creation of machines, parts, and structures from various raw materials.. Typically, a fabrication shop bids on a job, usually based on engineering drawings, and if awarded the contract, builds the product.Large fab shops employ a multitude of value-added

Step 2: Choose Your Wood and Prep It. You will need to choose your wood. This propeller is made of Hard Maple. If you are creating a propeller for acual load bearing use, you will need a hard wood like Maple. You then cut your wood into thin boards and glue them together like in the picture.

## fabrication steps for a machine
 Most fabrication shops have a range of machines, which can form holes for connections in structural steelwork. The traditional drilling machine is the radial drill, a manually operated machine, which drills individual holes in structural steelwork. But this method has become too slow for primary line production.

## What is the PCB Fabrication Process? - VSE
Each layer must be strictly controlled for its width, copper weight, and layer to layer alignment for a quality final product. Creating the Inner Layer Circuitry The first step in PCB fabrication is to print circuitry images onto the inner layer cores: The copper foil of the core is covered with a sheet of photoresist material.
