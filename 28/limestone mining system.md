The type of limestone treatment system used depends on the amount and ionic state of the iron in the AMD. Three groups of AMD are considered here (1) low iron AMD, (2) ferric iron AMD, and (3) ferrous iron AMD. Low Iron AMD Low iron AMD is the easiest to treat. Limestone beds (Figure 8) and pulverized limestone (Figure 9) can be effectively used.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Spreading over 85 hectares on the banks of the river Meuse, the Beez quarry has been in operation since 1848, when the stone was extracted by the power of man and horse alone. says.

Jul 15, 2021Rippers can be used for limestone mining as limestone is a 'rippable' sedimentary rock (refer to Sect. 3.1.1) Using rippers in small mines or for a group consisting of more than one mine is economical and productive. Instantaneous blasting or blasting with delay detonators in mines are executed in circuits.

## Limestone Mining | EROS - USGS
Limestone quarries, the dark rectangular shapes just west of the urban areas, provide about half of the rock used in Florida's construction. In this part of Florida, groundwater is very near the surface. So as the rock is mined, the quarry pits fill with water. These lakes range from 30 to 50 feet deep and cover a total of about 4,900 acres.
