## Aggregate Crushing Value Test -Determine Aggregate Crushing Strength
Aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the strength of the aggregate and it is used in construction of roads and pavements. Crushing value of aggregates indicates its strength. Lower crushing value is recommended for roads and pavements as it indicates a lower crushed fraction under load and would give a longer service life and a more

Estimating compressive strength . General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis, so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength > provided by C 0.
