## Tips on how and where to reuse concrete - Construction Review Online
May 24, 2022Concrete is recycled by using crushing equipment equipped with jaws and large impactors. Normally a secondary impactor is used and then screens are used to work with the concrete. One of these screens will be used to remove dirt and particles from concrete and the second screen will be used to remove coarse aggregate.

## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) — also called "crushed concrete" — is made up of asphalt debris from other construction projects that can be reused to create driveways, pathways, garden beds and more. When any concrete structure, road, sidewalk or parking lot is destroyed, that concrete is often deposited in a landfill.
