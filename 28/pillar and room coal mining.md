## On room and pillar mining? Explained by FAQ Blog
Room and pillar mining is still very common in underground coal mines, because it is very flexible and does not require a large capital expenditure for equipment like a longwall mining operation would.  Coal mining leads U.S. industries in fatal injuries, and miners have suffered prolonged health issues, such as black lung disease, which

Room and pillar mining is defined by the fact that portions of the coal seam being extracted are left in place to support the roof of the mine. Room and pillar mines are developed by using machinery to extract the coal seam in a grid like pattern through the development of a parallel series of extraction areas referred to as entries.

In room and pillar mining, seams of coal are mined partially, leaving large pillars of coal intact to support the overlying layers of rock.

As the rooms are cut, the continuous miner simultaneously loads the coal onto a shuttle or ram car where it will eventually be placed on a conveyor belt that will move it to the surface.

In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can be up to 40% of the total coal in the seam - although this coal can sometimes be recovered at a later stage.

## Sustainability | Free Full-Text | Research on Deformation and Failure 
The coal pillar side is severely broken due to multiple mining disturbances. In order to determine the reasonable grouting depth of the coal pillar side of the roadway wall, vertical stress data were extracted from each monitoring line position of the two sides of the roadway under different grouting depths, as shown in Figure 12. The vertical

## Using ARMPS to design a Room and Pillar Mine - Medium
The proposed layout for the mine was designed assuming C0 to be 16600, F to be 4, Sv to be 700, Length to be 10.8 ft, Re to be 0.82, Coal Seam Height to be 6 ft, and Width to be 3.03 ft.
