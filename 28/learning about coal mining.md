## Mining | Coal Mines
Highwall mining is an adaptation of auger mining. Instead of an auger hole, an entry into the coal seam is made by a continuous miner, remotely operated from a cabin at the surface. The cut coal is transported by conveyors behind the miner to the outside. Using a television camera, the operator can see and control the miner's progress.

Between 1980 and 2000, U.S. coal mining labor productivity increased at an average rate of 6. 7% per year, from 1.93 short tons per miner-hour to 7.02 short tons per miner-hour. The major factors underlying these gains were interfuel price competition, structural change in the industry, and technological improvements in coal mining. 3

In 1841 about 216,000 people were employed in the mines in Britain. Most coal was mined in the north and the north-east as well as the Midlands and some parts of Scotland. Due to the difficulties of moving coal many towns and industries were established around the large coal mines. How did coal production increase? 1700 : 2.7 million tonnes

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Oil, Gas & Mining Industry - PixelPlex
The coal industry has experienced five years of volatility. In the United States alone, the industry's market size has declined 8.1% per year on average between 2015 and 2020. This was due to fluctuations in coal prices, declining production from mines, and a general trend towards cleaner and less expensive energy alternatives.

A mining accident is an accident that occurs during the process of mining minerals or metals. Thousands of miners die from mining accidents each year, especially from underground coal mining, although accidents also occur in hard rock mining.Coal mining is considered much more hazardous than hard rock mining due to flat-lying rock strata, generally incompetent rock, the presence of methane gas
