## What is the Hardest Natural Stone? | Cosmos Surfaces
Granite is by far one of the most popular surfacing materials on the market. It's also one of the hardest natural stones—surpassed only by quartzite and gemstones. Coming in at between 6-8 on the Mohs hardness scale, granite countertops are favored for their durability, hardness, scratch-resistance, ease of maintenance and aesthetics. As
