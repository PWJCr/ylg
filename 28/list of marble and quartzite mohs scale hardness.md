## What is the Hardest Natural Stone? | Cosmos Surfaces
Granite is by far one of the most popular surfacing materials on the market. It's also one of the hardest natural stonesâ€”surpassed only by quartzite and gemstones. Coming in at between 6-8 on the Mohs hardness scale, granite countertops are favored for their durability, hardness, scratch-resistance, ease of maintenance and aesthetics. As
