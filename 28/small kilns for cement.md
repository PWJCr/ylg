Specialty wood shops, though small in size, have found themselves paying excessive wood drying costs. An in-house drying kiln would cut those costs drastically, but the kilns that were available were too large for a specialty wood shop. So in an effort to address these needs, Nova is proud to introduce the new Timber-Tike Dry Kiln.

## electric kilns for cement/lime-making? : engineering - reddit
Background: cement is responsible for 8% of greenhouse gas emissions. 75% of cement's emissions come from calcining limestone into lime (CaCO3 + heat (900C) --> CaO + CO2). The heat is supplied by fossil combustion (25% of CO2 emissions), so the pure CO2 from the limestone (50% of emissions) is contaminated/diluted and uneconomical to capture.
