## Waste Foundry Sand Usage for Building Material Production: A First 
In high-strength concretes, it was found that addition of the WFS above 10% was not usable. Another study found that the best WFS ratio for CS is 5-10%, and this ratio preserved the CS of mixtures made with standard sand, but ratios up to 5% and higher than 10% reduced the CS of samples by about 10% [ 10 ].

Developing Sustainable Ultra High Strength Concrete Mixtures Using Spent Foundry Sand 345 classification achieved through chemical analyses and particle size. The research conducted by Prabhu, G. G. et al. (from a cast iron plant) showed that the main source of foundry waste is molding sand (360 t/d). The remaining are from molds from dust

## Impact of Used Foundry Sand on Concrete's  - SpringerLink
Apr 11, 2021As per the researcher, reduction in strength is due to less porosity as well as the high brittleness of concrete with the use of a high amount of used foundry sand. Makul [ 23 ] reported highest compression strength with the use of 10% rice husk ash (RHA) and 30% used foundry sand (UFS) in a self-compacting concrete in his investigation, which
