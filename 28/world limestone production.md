Limestone produced and used for lime production, 14% (domestic and foreign). Government Stockpile: None. Events, Trends, and Issues: In 2020, domestic lime production was estimated to have decreased by 5% from that of 2019. A decline in lime production was a result of plants temporarily closing as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

## Cities of the future may be built with algae-grown limestone
Jun 23, 2022Global cement production accounts for 7% of annual greenhouse gas emissions in large part through the burning of quarried limestone. Now, a CU Boulder-led research team has figured out a way to make cement production carbon neutralâ€”and even carbon negativeâ€”by pulling carbon dioxide out of the air with the help of microalgae.
