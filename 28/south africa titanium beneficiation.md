## A feasibility study for titanium recycling in South Africa
ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In this study, the possibility of titanium recycling in South Africa is explored. Inspired by recent beneficiation processes for the production of titanium from South Africa's vast mineral resources, this study identified the opportunity to create sustainable value from the inevitable influx of scrap, once these beneficiation strategies have been implemented.
