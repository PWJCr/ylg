## Tips on How to Train Conveyor Belts • Con Belt
Signs of Good Training On a well-trained conveyor, the belt will make contact with all the horizontal roll the troughing idlers, and all the pulleys and idlers will be at right angle to the center line of the conveyor belt. Test Run Once you have finished a new conveyor installation, fully load the conveyor and let it run for several hours.

The Flexco line of conveyor belt tracking systems and trainers use a combination of friction and tension to correct alignment issues and avoid forces that can damage your conveyor belt and structure. Our unique "Pivot and Tilt" technology is used in many of our designs to respond and compensate immediately to conveyor belt misalignment.

## How Does A Conveyor Belt Work - Realonomics
How do conveyor systems work. Typically conveyor systems consist of a belt stretched across two or more pulleys. The belt forms a closed loop around the pulleys so it can continually rotate. One pulley known as the drive pulley drives or tows the belt moving items from one location to another. How do roller conveyor belts work?

Idlers or bend pulleys on convex (hump) curves along the return side have extra pressure due to component of the belt tension and are therefore effective training locations. Carrying side self aligners should not be located on a convex curve since their elevated positions can promote idler juncture failure of the carcass. Side Guide Rollers

If a conveyor belt creeps sideways, belt training idlers are used to return it to a central position. Conventionally the training idlers do this by pivoting about an axis normal to the conveyor belt surface (i.e. they "slew"). The slewing of the present training idlers however is also accompanied by a sideways tilting movement to increase the realigning influence of the idler.
