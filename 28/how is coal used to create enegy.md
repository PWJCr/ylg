## Commentary: Electricity Emergency - Alex Epstein
By Alex Epstein. America's grid is in decline and about to get far worse due to policies that 1) reward unreliable electricity, 2) prematurely shut down coal plants, 3) criminalize nuclear, and 4) force electric vehicle use.. Here's what's happening and how to fix it. A reliable grid is a foundation of our quality of life.

## Coal & electricity - World Coal Association
Coal plays a vital role in electricity generation worldwide. Coal-fired power plants currently fuel 37% of global electricity and figures from the IEA show that coal will still generate 22% of the world's electricity in 2040, retaining coal's position as the single largest source of electricity worldwide.

From 2010 to 2020, the amount of electricity produced by coal in China rose by 57 percent to 4,775 terawatt hours. From 2010 to 2021 — the latest year available and 2020 having been depressed by the response to Covid-19 — American coal use to generate electricity declined by 52 percent to 899 terawatt hours. U.S. coal power peaked in 2007.

## How does coal generate electricity? | National Grid ESO
What happens when coal is burned? When coal is burned, it reacts with oxygen in the air and all the stored solar energy is turned into thermal energy and released as heat. However, this chemical reaction also produces carbon dioxide and methane, greenhouse gases which are harmful to the environment.

## Generating Energy from Coal - Duke Energy
Duke Energy has used coal to produce energy in the Carolinas since 1911. The first coal-fired plants in Greensboro, N.C., and Greenville, S.C., originally only supplemented the company's use of hydroelectricity. This changed in the 1920s when energy demand exceeded what the hydroelectric stations could generate.

After undergoing heating and combustion, the water boils, and the resultant steam is used to drive the turbines to generate electricity. An alternate method is by using coal water slurry (CWS) fuel, which helps improve the efficiency of power generation. Out of the total electricity generated on our planet, around 40% is derived by heating coal.

These plants generate electricity reliably over long periods of time, and are generally cheap to build. How is coal used to make electricity energy? Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity.

## Coal explained - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
Coal is classified as a nonrenewable energy source because it takes millions of years to form. Coal contains the energy stored by plants that lived hundreds of millions of years ago in swampy forests. Layers of dirt and rock covered the plants over millions of years. The resulting pressure and heat turned the plants into the substance we call coal.
