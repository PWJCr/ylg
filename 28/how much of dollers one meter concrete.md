## How many bags of cement and sand and gravel are in 1 cubic meter?
There is a 1:2:3 ratio of bags of cement and sand and gravel in 1 cubic meter. As a general rule of thumb, you can approximate this by percentage: If the total number of units of cement and aggregates in 4.5 cubic meters of concrete at a 1:2:3 ratio is 6. One-sixth of an inch equals 0.75 centimeters of cement.
