## Cement Manufacturing Process - All About Engineering
Manufacturing of cement is a very critical process because there are more than 25 types of cement. It begins with mining, grinding of material, and then passes through the kiln at 1450° C which is very high temperature and then gypsum is added with it. Cement is used in different types of concrete, but the most commonly used cement is Portland

A typical raw mix consists of 75-85% limestone, 12-25% shale, the balance consisting of silica or quartzite and iron oxide. Exact proportioning is dependent upon their chemical properties before and after calcining to cement clinker. For good kiln practice the grind required is 88-92% - 200 mesh for standard cement, 99%-200 mesh for high early.

## Portland cement
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin, and is usually made from limestone.It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker

## What is concrete grinding and why is it important?
Concrete grinding makes use of a concrete grinder to level a rough surface and give it a smooth finish. Grinding concrete can be done in 2 ways; either wet or dry. Most contractors prefer the wet grinding process, owing to the possible negative impacts of the dust on the workers' health from dry grinding. Need for concrete grinding

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
