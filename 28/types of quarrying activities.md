## Common Types of Mining Equipment Used in the Mining Industry
A rotary drill rig is one of two main types of drills used for mining. The other type is a percussion or hammer drill. For a rotary drill rig, the drill bit turns under pressure to cut into the rock. As the bit turns, the rock grinds down while compressed air sends it back up the drill to the top to keep the hole and bit clean.

In mining and quarrying, water is used and gets polluted in a range of activities, including mineral processing, dust suppression, and slurry transport. In addition, water is subtracted from the environment in the process of dewatering, the process of pumping away the water that naturally flows into the pit or tunnels of the mine.
