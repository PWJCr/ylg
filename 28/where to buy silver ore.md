The way Transmute works is it first turns any Iron Ore in the player's inventory into Silver Ore. Once all the Iron Ore has been converted, casting the spell again will now turn any Silver Ore into Gold Ore. This process multiplies the initial value of Iron Ore by 25, as Iron Ore is sold for 2 gold, and Gold Ore sells for 50.
