## How to Choose Quality Coarse Aggregate for Concrete Construction?
Coarse aggregates with a size of 20 mm or less are commonly used for the majority of concrete construction. One can roughly check the surface texture, particle shape, and cleanliness of the coarse aggregate just by visual observation. However, porosity and gradations require specific laboratory tests.

Because aggregate, the most mined resource in the world, is nonrenewable, using RAP conserves the virgin resource itself, as well as the energy and transportation costs that go into obtaining it. In addition, using RAP greatly reduces the amount of construction debris going into landfills. Because RAP can be used again and again, it creates a cycle of asphalt reuse that optimizes.

## Why is a coarse aggregate mixed with concrete? - Quora
So it's not correct to say that coarse aggregate is mixed with concrete, rather aggregates are mixed with cement and water to form concrete. Aggregates form the bulk of concrete (60-80%) means it occupies a significant volume in concrete. Coarse aggregate and fine aggregate are mixed such that the concrete becomes well graded aggregate concrete.

Variation in the size of Aggregates changes the water demand, cement content, micro-cracking (strength) in concrete. It also effects pumpability, and durability of concrete.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

The gradation of the aggregates used in the concrete mixture are also important. A well-graded combined (both coarse and fine fractions) aggregate will reduce mix water demand, result in higher strengths, and be easier to place and finish. The likelihood of a quality concrete mixture is increased if a more well-graded aggregate blend is used. 3.
