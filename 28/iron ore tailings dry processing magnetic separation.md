Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

Strong magnetic iron ore separation process. It is used to low grade magnetite. Due to the strong magnetic and easy to grind, one stage grinding is adopted for magnetite with coarse particle distribution, conversely the multi stages grinding. At present the fine grinding technology promoted by Xinhai improves the concentrate grate from 61% to 67%.

## separation process of iron ore
Magnetic Separation Process Of Iron Ore - FTM Machinery. Besides, the separation machines are devide into the dry and wet magnetic separation. Generally, iron ore with an iron content of 35% can increase iron content by 20% after magnetic separation. Such a combined process method, the ore utilization rate can reach 90%.

## Dry Magnetic Separation of Iron Ore of the Bakchar Deposit
The main task of magnetic separation is to increase the total iron content in concentrates to a value which allows its further metallurgical processing. Ferruginous ore particles have a rounded shape that facilitates a separation process. The paper considers the influence of technological parameters on the magnetic concentrate yield and

## Evaluation of Additional Iron Recovery from Iron Ore Tailings
The article demonstrates feasibility of additional iron recovery from the secondary kind of mineral raw materials—dry magnetic separation tailings obtained at crushing and processing factories of Abaza and Irba and wet magnetic separation tailing produced at Abagur processing plant of Evrazruda. Dry centrifugal separation treatment of Abaza tailings-3 mm in size allowed 6.3% of middlings
