## Manganese: Nodules, Uses, Facts, Ore, Alloys, Metal - Geology
Manganese removes oxygen and sulfur when iron ore (an iron and oxygen compound) is converted into iron. It also is an essential alloy that helps convert iron into steel. As an alloy, it decreases the brittleness of steel and imparts strength. The amount of manganese used per ton of steel is rather small, ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms.

Stroud cited laboratory tests on cement, galena and iron oxide (Fe2O3) as materials for increasing the density of mud. Iron oxide could be used to raise mud density to 16 Ib/gal (specific gravity of 1.86) without an excessive increase in consistency. Iron oxide (hematite) was used successfully in several fields.

## Theerei-balle
The process of black Manganese Phosphating, resistant to corrosion, is applied on steel and cast iron surfaces.It consists mainly of iron and manganese phosphate and reduces wear and tear on workpieces such as pistons, rings, cam shafts, engines, cams, and other similar surfaces. Layer weight may vary between 10 and 30 gr/m2. All iron must be in soluble form.

## Manganese, manganese ore, ferromanganese and manganese dioxide: - Blogger
In cast iron, manganese is used mainly to counteract the bad effects of sulfur. In steel, manganese acts as a deoxidizer and combines with sulfur, thereby improving the hot-working properties of the steel. Also improves the strength, toughness of steel. Other use of manganese ore is in batteries as manganese dioxide.

## Manganese Dioxide - Studio Operations and Making Work - Ceramic Arts 
Manganese Dioxide specifically. Apparently Manganese Dioxide is extremely toxic. whoops. handled it without gloves nor a respirator. I even breathed the fumes from the kiln. Bad mistake. Anyways I applied 100% manganese dioxide onto the exteriors of a few things, the outside of a bowl, outside of a coffee cup, and the very lip of a mug.
