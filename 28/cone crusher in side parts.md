A crusher should be operated above 40% but below 100% rated horsepower in order to maximize cone crusher productivity and to have a proper "loaded bearing alignment". An optimal power range is to operate between 75%-95%. Operating a crusher above 110% rated power can cause premature crusher failure.

## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
