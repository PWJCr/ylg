## Crushed stone
Crushed stone. 20 mm (0.79 in) crushed stone, used for construction aggregate and landscape applications. Crushed stone or angular rock is a form of construction aggregate, typically produced by mining a suitable rock deposit and breaking the removed rock down to the desired size using crushers.

## Aggregates - Cement
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

Sep 22, 2020Crushed concrete aggregates are pieces of old concrete buildings, roads, and other destroyed concrete structures that are crushed in a crushing machine. This crushed material is then washed clean, then broken up into smaller fragments. The fragments are added to other materials, including virgin concrete, to create recycled aggregate.

Crushed stone is produced by crushing quarry rock, boul-ders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Crushed air-cooled blast-furnace slag is also used as fine or coarse aggregate. The aggregates are usually washed and graded at the pit or plant. Some variation in the type, quality, cleanli-ness, grading, moisture content, and other properties is expected.
