## Blasting- Highly Technical Prescribed and Scientific Process
Blasting is a highly technical, prescribed and scientific process. To remove the maximum amount of rock with minimal impact, and to ensure the blast's reliability and predictability, there are a number of steps that must be taken. These include the sequencing and timing of a blast and analyzing the physical properties of the source material

## Quarry Factsheet - Blasting LR - Living near a quarry BLASTING 
A quarry's strict operating conditions require that every action be taken to reduce these impacts to safe levels. Depending on how close you live to the quarry, you may notice some slight vibration or noise associated with blasting. When blasting is undertaken at a quarry, two types of vibration occur - ground vibration and overpressure.

A quarry is a type of open-pit mine in which dimension stone, rock, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, gravel, or slate is excavated from the ground. The operation of quarries is regulated in some jurisdictions to reduce their environmental impact. The word quarry can also include the underground quarrying for stone, such as Bath stone.
