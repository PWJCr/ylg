## Better Pipe and Tube - T&H Lemont
High Frequency Induction Welding. In the HFI tube welding process, high frequency current is induced in the open seam tube by an induction coil located ahead of (upstream from) the weld point, as shown in Fig. 1-1. The tube edges are spaced apart when they go through the coil, forming an open vee whose apex is slightly ahead of the weld point.

## Induction Heating for Welding Applications
With induction welding, the heat is electromagnetically induced in the workpiece. The speed and accuracy of induction welding makes it ideal for edge welding of tubes and pipes. In this process, pipes pass an induction coil at high speed. As they do so, their edges are heated, then squeezed together to form a longitudinal weld seam.

## Induction Heating for the Steel Industry - Inductotherm Corp.
Induction heaters can also help you decarbonize by reducing CO2, SO2, NOX and other toxic emissions by at least 50%. In a combustion furnace, heat is created by burning a fuel such as coke, oil or natural gas. The burning fuel heats up the inside of the furnace. This then heats up the surface of the product inside the furnace.
