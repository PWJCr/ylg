2.2 Choghart iron ore mineral waste The Choghart iron mine (55Â°28Î2ËE, 31Â°42Î00ËN) is located in 12 km northeast of Bafq town in the center of Iran. Mineralization at this mine occurs mainly with a high-grade iron ore (magnetite and hematite), a high phosphorous-low grade iron, Metasomatic and Quartz-Albitophire rocks (Fig.3).

## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)Â·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
