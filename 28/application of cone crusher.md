## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

## Application of Cone Crusher in Granite Production Line
It is not feasible to only use jaw crusher or impact crusher in granite production line. Because the crushed materials produced by jaw crusher cannot meet the strict requirement for construction materials, while impact crusher has bad abrasion when crush hard materials. As a consequence, cone crusher is the optimal crusher in granite production.
