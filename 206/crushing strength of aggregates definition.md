## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

Aggregates are the fraction of rock which are inert or non-reactive. These are obtained from rocks by means of crushing. Main constituents of the wearing surface are bitumen and aggregates. Mostly 90 % of the road consists of aggregates. There are two problems to use non-inert materials. Cost will increase.

Aggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also. Angular aggregates have a lower ACV, than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength, will give a higher MPa value. It can be considered as a concrete cylinder or UCS tested in lab. So it is hard to corelate

Mar 23, 2022The surface area of coarse aggregates is less than that of finer aggregates for an equal volume, thus requiring less paste to cover each grain. Fine aggregates; Fine aggregates have a particle size ranging from 4.75 to 0.075 millimeters. The content of fine aggregates in concrete is generally between 35 and 45% by mass or volume of total aggregate.
