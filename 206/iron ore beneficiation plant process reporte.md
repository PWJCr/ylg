Processed Iron Ore increases campaign life. Fine particles and Alumina in the feed end up as accretions in the kiln walls. Lower Alumina in the feed means a considerable reduction in cleaning and maintenance of the kilns. CDE Wet Screening technology also ensures lesser dust accumulation in the dust cleaning system reducing its cost implications.
