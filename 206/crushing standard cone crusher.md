## Patriot® Cone Crusher | Secondary or Tertiary Crusher | Superior Industries
GUARANTEED FOR REAL LIFE. Typically applied in secondary and tertiary stages, the cone crusher produces reduction ratios of 6:1 to 4:1. Bushing cones, like Superior's Patriot Cone Crusher, consist of a rotating mantle inside a steel bowl. As rock is compressed between the mantle and the bowl, the force generated fractures the material.

## Crushing Plant Startup Sequence & Procedure
The Crushing Plant operator must monitor the cone crusher power draw displayed on the cone crusher ammeter. The ammeter should show no major fluctuations and should read approximately 100 amps. An excessively high power draw on the cone crusher indicates the cone is being overloaded, which may be due to a high feed rate or a blinded screen.
