## The Chinese Iron Ore Deposits and Ore Production
4.1. Fine grain iron ore beneficiation. In China, iron ore with hematite grain size of less than 0.045 mm or magnetite grain size of less than 0.03 mm is commonly referred to as fine-grained iron ore . Yuanjiacun Iron deposit and Qidong Iron deposit in Shanxi and Hunan Province, respectively, are the most typical fine grain iron deposits in China.

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total

Jul 19, · For an iron ore deposit to be considered economically recoverable, it must contain at least 25% iron [].However, ores with iron content lower than 25% can still be economically exploited if the ore deposit is large (economy of scale), can be concentrated (beneficiation), and can be transported cheaply [].Out of more than 300 iron

The lenticular ore bodies show a tendency to peter out and give rise to soft powdery ore at either end, and similar powdery ore is also encountered at depth. Therefore, the available reserves of high grade ore, carrying more than 62 per cent. iron, are limited, and there is a greater proportion of the ore carrying between 58 and 60 per cent. of

These ores subject to beneficiation yield a concentrate containing 61.5 to 66% Fe at 62 to 86% yield. In case of BHQ ore, column flotation technique has been adopted to obtain a concentrate of 66% Fe at 44.7% yield. It has been observed that beneficiation of low grade ores invariably pose specific challenge due to the presence of clayey/earthy
