Missouri was admitted to the union in 1821, making it the second state within the LouisianaTerritory. Missouri began mining coal in the 1840s and was the first commercial coal mining state west of the Mississippi River. Most of the early mines were underground and have since been abandoned. Surface mining didn't start in Missouri until the 1930s.

## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained | Anglo American
The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.
