## coal utilization - Liquefaction | Britannica
Liquefaction is the process of converting solid coal into liquid fuels. The main difference between naturally occurring petroleum fuels and coal is the deficiency of hydrogen in the latter: coal contains only about half the amount found in petroleum. Therefore, conversion of coal into liquid fuels involves the addition of hydrogen. Hydrogenation of coal can be done directly, either from

May 30, 2022The primary chemical reaction of direct coal liquefaction is hydrogenation of the coal to break the coal into smaller molecules and increase the hydrogen:carbon ratio. Addition of hydrogen also removes the heteroatoms nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen by converting them to ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water, respectively.
