Burning coal seam: This type of underground fire follows the fuel source (carbon) along the coal seam. Based on geological structure, these fires break into two categories: Horizontal coal beds . Coal seams which are generally flat lying. Occurrences are generally east of the Rockies and in Northern Alaska.

The coal 'face' can vary in length from m. Self-advancing, hydraulically-powered supports temporarily hold up the roof while coal is extracted. When coal has been extracted from the area, the roof is allowed to collapse. Over 75% of the coal in the deposit can be extracted from panels of coal that can extend 3km through the coal seam.

Below the densely forested slopes of the Appalachian Mountains in southern West Virginia is a layer cake of thin coal seams. To uncover this coal profitably, mining companies engineer large—sometimes very large—surface mines. This time-series of images of a surface mine in Boone County, West Virginia, illustrates why this controversial mining method is also called "mountaintop removal."

## Mining | Coal Mines
Highwall mining is an adaptation of auger mining. Instead of an auger hole, an entry into the coal seam is made by a continuous miner, remotely operated from a cabin at the surface. The cut coal is transported by conveyors behind the miner to the outside. Using a television camera, the operator can see and control the miner's progress.

The main deposit consists of many thick seams in about 500 km of the Latrobe Valley. The YaHourn coal field provides most of the fuel. The top coal seam is 65 m thick and is covered with 13 m of overburden. Most of this coal is used for electric power generation. It is very moist (55—72%), but has less than 5% ash.

National Park Service. A coal seam is a black banded or dark brown coal deposit evident in rock layers. These deposits are below the ground level and, based on their distance from the surface, can be extracted using techniques of either deep or strip mining. Such seams undergo natural formation of coal and function as a typical supply of coal.

## Experiment and numerical simulation of overburden and surface damage 
Apr 26, 2022Coal mining has caused a series of geological and ecological concerns, including surface cracks, land subsidence, reductions in surface water and spring areas, declines in groundwater levels, and vegetation degradation (Wang et al. 2020a; Liu et al. 2018).Additionally, the development of mining slope cracks will induce slope instability, which will result in secondary mine geological disasters
