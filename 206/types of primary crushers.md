## Hammermill Crushers | McLanahan
The Standard and Non-Clog Industrial Hammermills are designed to reduce the material to a nominal 3" to 5" (75mm to 25mm) output. These are primary stage crushers, commonly followed with Centerfeed Mills or other types of secondary stage crushers. The HammerMaster is also a secondary stage crusher in that the maximum feed size is 6" (150mm).

## What is a Primary Crusher?
A primary crusher breaks up large pieces of rock or concrete from the blasting or excavation process and turns them into smaller, more manageable chunks. This is the first step in the crushing process. The smaller pieces can then either be pre-screened or fed directly into a secondary impact or cone crusher.

## 4 Types of Stone Crushers' Maintenance and Efficient Improvement
Jul 20, 2022There are different types of stone crushers in mining industry such as jaw crusher, cone crusher, impact crusher, and sand making machine.  For example, if a horizontal shaft impact crusher is used in primary crushing, the rotor should be solid because the inertia is relatively large, vice versa.

## Different types of crushing equipments - Constro Facilitator
Types of crusher depend on the feeding method. These are- Primary crusher, Secondary crusher and Tertiary crusher. The primary crusher is only for the breaking of large stones into pieces (this means primary crusher is not for the aggregate size material.). Examples of primary crushers are jaw crusher; hammer mill crusher and gyratory crusher.
