## Why limestone and coke is added in blast furnace?
Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening, after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder. Where is blast furnace?
