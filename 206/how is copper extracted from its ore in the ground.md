## How is copper extracted by pyrometallurgy?ntal
How is copper usually extracted? Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.

## Why is the extraction of copper from pyrites?
The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulfate ores. Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper.
