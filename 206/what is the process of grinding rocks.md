The crust (outermost and thinnest) and uppermost part of the mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere. Based on the formation process, there are three main types of rock found on the Earth: Igneous. Metamorphic, and. Sedimentary. The 'igneous' word is derived from the Latin word "ignis" which means 'fire.'.
