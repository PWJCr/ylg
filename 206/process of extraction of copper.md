Extraction of Copper. It is mainly extracted from copper pyrites (CuFeS 2). The sulphide ore is usually of very low grade and contains iron sulphide, gangue and smaller quantities of arsenic, antimony, selenium tellurium, silver, gold and platinum.  In this process, the finely powdered ore is mixed with water and some pine oil in a tank.

copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

## In hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of copper?
Which process are used for extraction of copper? The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulfate ores. Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper.

## Copper Production: How Is Copper Made? - ThoughtCo
The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
