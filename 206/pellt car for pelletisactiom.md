## Binders and other additives - crucial for pellet making - Pioneer:Feed 
Due to the different characteristics of various raw materials, the pellet quality is unequal. To improve the pellet quality or maximize production capacity, you can add binder to help the lignin-lacked material to compress into pellets much easier.. Whether producing a single material pellet or a mixed material pellet, material consistency is crucial to efficient pelletization.
