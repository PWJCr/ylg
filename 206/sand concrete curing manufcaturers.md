## Concrete test cube manufacturing and curing procedures
Place the moulds on a smooth, level surface. Fill the moulds with concrete in layers of depth 50mm. Compact each concrete layer in the mould either by: Using a tamping or compaction rod to tamp the concrete. For 150x150x150mm cubes, 45 evenly distributed strokes are required, and for 100x100x100mm cubes, 20 evenly distributed strokes are required.

## Sand or gravel under concrete slabigns
Experienced gravel suppliers advise using crushed stone beneath the concrete to deter water accumulation. The stone crevices provide an easy exit route for water, preventing it from pooling under the concrete. Moreover, crushed stone adds a protective underlayment that keeps water from touching the concrete slab. 3. Prevent Concrete Cracks.
