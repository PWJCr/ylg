## Using of Robo Sand or M Sand instead of natural sand
Residual of this sand is allowed to use by mix with natural sand. This reduces the wastage of material and increases the economy. It provides better strength and durability as compared to river sand. Due to rough surface or texture, provides good bonding strength. Robo sand and M sand does not follow code specification values.

## Experimental investigation on compressive behaviour of plastic brick 
Nov 16, 2020By considering these effects, the waste plastic materials started to use in construction in various forms. In this paper, the plastic waste is added to M Sand to fabricate Plastic M Sand bricks. The dosage of plastic addition (Waste plastic: M Sand) is varied from the ratio 1:1 (C1 type) to 1:2 (C2 type).

## Why do We Need Sand Filling in Footing - Civil Snapshot
Sand is used to minimizing that resistance. Even though we use anti-termite in foundations, there may be some weak spots for termite entry. This is one of the reasons why we use sand (with anti-termite treatment) below the foundation. Note: We also use M-sand instead of river sand.

## Common Types Of Sand Used In Construction - Pinoy Builders
Crushed Stone Sand. It looks like gravel and feels like gravel. But unlike gravel, crushed stone sand is a natural but commercially created resource that is made from crushed minerals, such as granite or limestone. Crushed stone sand is commonly used for road construction, and is widely known as a low-cost, high-value commodity.

## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid.

The sand must be of proper gradation ( it should have particles from 150 microns to 4.75 mm proper proportion).

## Manufactured Sand for Construction - Structural Guide
Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is used as a substitution to the river sand in construction. River sand is becoming a decaying resource in some parts of the year due to the lack of rains to collect the sand on the river beds. Manufactured sand can be considered as a by-product of the process of producing coarse aggregates.
