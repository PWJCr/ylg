## Crusher Closed / Open Side Setting Program - Global Physical Asset 
Crusher Vision was developed to minimize down-time when assessing wear on gyratory crusher mantles and concaves in the mining sector. Current methods of assessing wear are inaccurate, dangerous and require that the equipment be shut down for at least an hour, which results in production losses. In contrast, Crusher Vision can measure the CSS

## Gyratory Mantles and Concaves - Tempus Steel
Gyratory Mantles and Concaves. Gyratory mantle and concave design is pivotal to downstream process efficiency. Due to inconsistent feed size, fines ratio, clay content, moisture and throughput rates, gyratory crushers have inherent problems of poor wear predictability of both mantle and concaves and excessive wear in the lower chamber.

## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
These crushers are designed so that the head-to-depth ratio is larger than the standard gyratory crusher and the cone angles are much flatter and the slope of the mantle and the concaves are parallel to each other. The flatter cone angles help to retain the particles longer between the crushing surfaces and therefore produce much finer particles.
