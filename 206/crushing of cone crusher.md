## Small Crushing Plant Operating Guide - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The cone crusher drive will stop if the both lube pumps are stopped. A low pressure switch in the oil feed line will stop the lube pumps on a low oil pressure condition and hence stop the cone crusher after a 1 minute delay. An oil temperature switch and alarm in the oil return line will alarm on a excessively high oil temperature. On shutdown
