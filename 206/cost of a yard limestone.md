## Current cost for caliche? | TexAgs
7:33a, 5/14/20. AG. Limestone base or just rock is around $30 a ton in se Tx. Price will vary by area and distance to source. It's hauled or mainly railed into the Houston area. Nice to have an extra supply for future road repairs or to use around corrals/load out areas. I'd definitely keep it there.
