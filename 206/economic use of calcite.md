Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock that looks like concrete. It consists of large, rounded pebbles (clasts) cemented by a matrix made of calcite, iron oxide, or silica. Conglomerate rock occurs where gravel can become rounded by traveling distances or being subjected to tumbling. Beaches, riverbeds, and glaciers can produce conglomerate.
