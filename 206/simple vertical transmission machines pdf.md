A machine is a tool used to make work easier. Simple machines are simple tools used to make work easier. Compound machines have two or more simple machines working together to make work easier. In science, work is defined as a force acting on an object to move it across a distance. Pushing, pulling, and lifting are common forms of work.

## What are Simple Machines? | Physics in Industrial  - control
A machine in the broad sense of the word is any device designed to translate some form of energy into useful work. A "simple" machine is one where both the input energy and the output energy are mechanical in nature (i.e. both are forces acting along displacements). Examples of simple machines include levers, pulleys, ramps, wedges, gears

Vertical transmission refers to generational transmission of viruses from parents to their offspring. HIV-1, e.g., can be acquired in utero (via breaks in the placental barrier or transcytosis of cell-associated virus), during delivery (intrapartum), or via breastfeeding. Approximately 20% of viral plant pathogens are known to be seed transmitted.

Force on the wedge's wide end makes the narrow end go into an object. The narrow end makes a path for the thicker end and the wedge splits the object.

The virus can be transmitted to the next generation of insects in the form of an overt infection, as well as in a latent state, without causing mortality of individuals of the filial generation. Mortality in different species of insects as a result of vertical transmission of the virus varies from 0.5 to 100%.

## Simple Lifting Machine: Introduction, types, uses - Engineers Rail
Lever-. A lever is a simple machine, used to lift weight. Basically, it is a rod and free to move about in a fixed point. The word lever comes from the French verb lever which means to raise. Lever has two parts, the first one is a fulcrum and the second one is a bar. A fulcrum is a point on which a bar rests or is supported.

The most simplest of machines is the common lever. A simple log can act to magnify forces and shift objects heavier than the person holding the log. All levers have a fulcrum (turning point), effort (the force provided to do the work) and the load (the force we are pushing against).There are three
