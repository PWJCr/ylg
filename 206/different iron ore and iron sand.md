## Microwave Processing of Low-Grade Banded Iron Ore with Different 
Sep 21, 2020The current study investigates the effect of microwave processing on low-grade banded iron ore using charcoal, coking coal, and non-coking coal. Charcoal showed better microwave heating response at low temperatures, and the coals exhibit better heating response at higher temperatures. Low carbon dosage ~ 12% is sufficient to generate concentrate with 61.8% iron grade and ~6% for 94.8% iron
