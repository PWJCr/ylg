## Jaw Crushers - high quality and reliability from RETSCH
The crushing ratio of a jaw crusher results from the maximum achievable final fineness in relation to the maximum feed size. For Retsch jaw crushers, this lies between 12.5 and 220. A high value reflects the capacity of a jaw crusher to accept large sample pieces and provide powerful crushing performance, resulting in high final fineness.
