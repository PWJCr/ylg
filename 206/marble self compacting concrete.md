## Experimental and Theoretical Study of a New Technique for Mixing Self 
Currently, marble waste is valued by incorporating powders, obtained by drying and grinding sludge resulting from marble blocks cutting operation, or the aggregates, obtained by crushing the solid waste, on self-compacting concrete. These two procedures require a lot of energy. This experimental and theoretical work focuses on the direct incorporation of marble sludge in self-compacting concrete.

Sufficient deformability can be achieved in concrete while maintaining segregation resistance either by using a chemical viscosity-modifying admixture (VMA) or increasing the fine content in the concrete. Using VMA, the initial cost of self-compacting concrete (SCC) increases, making it unsuitable for general construction. As a result, alternative methods for lowering the cost of SCC must be

Self-Compacting Concrete Uses . Self-compacting concrete has been used in bridges and even on pre-cast sections. One of the most remarkable projects built using self-compacting concrete is the Akashi-Kaikyo Suspension Bridge.In this project, the SCC was mixed on-site and pumped through a piping system to the specified point, located 200 meters away.
