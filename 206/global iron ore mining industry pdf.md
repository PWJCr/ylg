##  Economic impact of world mining - International Nuclear Information System
Abstract. Mining plays a vital role in the economic development of many countries. The emerging economies are now major players in the production and availability of key commodities such as copper (70%), bauxite (40%), iron ore and precious metals. Mining also has a positive impact on the economy of many countries.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

##  Dynamic Determinants in Global Iron Ore Supply Chain - CIRRELT
1. THE IRON ORE INDUSTRY. 1.1. Iron ore supply . Iron ore accounts for 5% of the earth's crust, of which only a small part is concentrated in rich deposits. The grade of iron ore deposits varies from 20-30% for poorer sources to as much as 60-70% for the higher-grade deposits. World reserves of iron ore are estimated

## Iron ore facts - NRCan
Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.
