## Comparison Between Natural Sand And Rock Crushed
Nov 11, 2020 This material, often named artificial sand, industrial sand or crushed rock sand (CRS) has less impurities, is environmentally friendly and cheaper compared to NRS (Mundra et al. 2016). In this paper, the performance of a rapid filter with gneissic CRS as filter bed was compared to a conventional NRS filter in pilot-scale experiments.
