In recent years the use of cyanide in gold mining has become the dominant means by which gold is extracted from a body of ore. The mercury amalgamation process had previously been used but recovered only about 60 per cent of an ore body's gold. In contrast, leaching finely ground ore with cyanide can recover up to 97 per cent of the ore body

## What Is Underground Mining - Realonomics
What is the use of underground mining? Mineral production in which all extracting operations are conducted beneath the ground surface is termed underground mining. Underground mining methods are usually employed when the depth of the deposit and/or the waste to ore ratio (stripping ratio) are too great to commence a surface operation.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied.

Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores. The great majority of gold is extracted from dilute ores using a combination of chemical processes.  The expansion of gold mining in the Rand of South Africa began to slow down in the 1880s, as the new deposits being found tended to be pyritic ore. The gold was

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## Scottish researchers develop new gold extraction method
This extraction process is expected to help recover approximately 300t of the precious metal. According to researchers, existing methods for extracting gold are inefficient and can be dangerous to health, as they use toxic chemicals such as cyanide. Electrical waste is believed to contain as much as 7% of the entire world's gold.
