## Removing Iron And Titanium Oxides From Ball Clay
Aug 01, 2006 The use of chlorination for the removal of iron and titanium from clay minerals, and particularly kaolin, has given excellent results. In these processes, high temperatures (700 to 1000 C) are used, at which the dehydroxylation of kaolinite has already taken place giving as products metakaolinite, and, at higher temperatures
