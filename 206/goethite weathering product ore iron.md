## Goethite Mineral | Physical - Optical Properties, Uses, Occurrence
Goethite is an iron oxide hydroxide, although manganese can substitute for up to 5 percent of the iron. It forms as a weathering product in the oxidation zones of veins of iron minerals, such as pyrite, magnetite and siderite. Goethite may occur with these minerals in the gossan, or iron hat, which is the weathered capping of an iron ore deposit.

## Impact of coexisting mineral on crystallinity and stability of Fe(II 
5 days agoThe iron oxyhydroxides such as ferrihydrite and green rust are eventually converted to stable iron oxides such as goethite, lepidocrocite, magnetite, maghemite, hematite, schwertmannite, akaganeite, jarosites and ferric arsenates. The Fe(III) precipitates formed are subject to changes in the physical and chemical conditions of the environment.

## Goethite - Assignment Point
Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide containing ferric iron. It is the main component of rust and bog iron ore. Goethite's hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs scale, and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3. The mineral forms prismatic needle-like crystals ("needle iron ore"), but is more typically massive.
