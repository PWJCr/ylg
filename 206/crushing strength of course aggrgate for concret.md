## Functions Of Fine and Coarse Aggregate in Concrete
Fine aggregates perform the following functions: 1. It assists in producing workability and uniformly in mixture. 2. It assists the cement paste to hard the coarse aggregate particles. 3. It helps to prevent possible segregation of paste and coarse aggregate particularly during the transport operation of concrete for a long distance. 4.

## How to Determine the Aggregate Crushing Strength Value in  - ReadCivil
Procedure for crushing strength of aggregate. Before testing, the aggregate should be in surface dry condition.You can achieve the dry condition of aggregate by placing aggregates in an oven for 4 hours at 100-degree Celcius. The aggregates passing through 12.5mm and retained on 10mm IS sieves are selected for finding aggregate crushing strength.

## Crushing Strength Of Coarse Aggregate Testing Procedure
Aggregate crushing value of coarse aggregate note 1 the aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load with aggre gate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher the result may be anomalous and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead note 2 the standard aggregate crushing test.
