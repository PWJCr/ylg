A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.

## Types Of Metal Cutting Machine Tools - Plant Automation Technology
The operations are now performed on various types of grinding machines. Compared to any other standard machine tool in the manufacturing industry, the grinding machines have advanced in construction, rigidity, design, and application far more in the last decade. The grinding machines fall into five different categories such as -

2. Precision grinding machines 4.2.1 Rough grinding machines The rough grinding machines are used to remove stock with no reference to the accuracy of results. Excess metal present on the cast parts and welded joints are removed by rough grinders. The main types of rough grinders are: 1. Hand grinding machine 2. Bench grinding machine 3.

7 days agoThe present article aims to put forth a novel methodology to predict and validate the specific energy consumption for cut-off grinding of oxygen-free copper (OFC-C10100) using supervised machine learning techniques. State-of-the-art experimental setup was designed to perform the abrasive cutting of the material at various cutting conditions.
