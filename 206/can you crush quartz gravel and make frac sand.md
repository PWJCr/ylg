Mar 30, 2022Frac Sand. Frac sand is a high-purity quartz sand that is injected into wells to blast and hold open cracks in the shale rock layer during the fracking process. In the United States, frac sand is being mined intensively from sandstone deposits across large swaths of land in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan.

Frac sand (aka proppant) is a specialized type of round and highly durable crystalline silica sand pumped with water at high pressure during hydraulic fracturing. The proppant creates and holds open fractures in the rock to increase permeability and, ultimately, the rock's ability to flow hydrocarbons into the wellbore and up to the surface.
