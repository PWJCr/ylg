Silver is stable in water and air, but sulfur compounds in air cause a black tarnish to appear. Silver will react with acids and bases. Humans have been using silver as far back as 3000 B.C.E. for jewelry, mirrors and silverware.

Minerals can be formed from the intense heat and pressure found far beneath the Earth's crust in the mantle, where molten rock flows as liquid magma. Silicates in the magma can form minerals such as hornblende and other igneous rocks as the magma cools. This process can take millions of years. Ninety-five percent of the Earth's crust is formed

The ManufacturingProcess. Silver was first obtained in sixteenth-century Mexico by a method called the patio process. It involved mixing silver ore, salt, copper sulphide, and water. The resultant silver chloride was then picked up by adding mercury. This inefficient method was superseded by the von Patera process.
