## What is a Cone Crusher| Advantages, Types, Parts and Specifications 
How A Cone Crusher Works. The moving cone of the cone crusher performs a swing motion under the action of the eccentric sleeve. The material is continuously squeezed, impacted and broken in the crushing cavity formed by the bowl liner and the mantle liner, and falls from the mantle swing gap that meets the discharge requirements.
