The primary impact crushers are used to process from 200 t/h up to 1900 t/h and feed sizes of up to 1830 mm (71") in the largest model. Primary impact crushers are generally used in nonabrasive applications and where the production of fines is not a problem. Of all primary crushers, the impactor is the crusher that gives the best cubical product.

## What is a Primary Crusher?
A primary crusher breaks up large pieces of rock or concrete from the blasting or excavation process and turns them into smaller, more manageable chunks. This is the first step in the crushing process. The smaller pieces can then either be pre-screened or fed directly into a secondary impact or cone crusher.

HSI crushers can be primary or secondary crushers. In the primary stage, HSIs are better suited for softer rock, such as limestone, and less abrasive stone. In the secondary stage, the HSI can process more abrasive and harder stone.  Compression-type crushers such as jaws and cones can clog due to packing (caking) of RAP when the RAP is warm

Types of crushers. Crushers are classified into three types based upon the stage of crushing they accomplish. These are (i) primary crusher, (ii) secondary crusher, and (iii) tertiary crusher. The primary crusher receives material directly from run of mine (ROM) after blasting and produces the first reduction in size.
