## Quarrying of Stones for Construction Works -Site Selection and Methods
What is Stone Quarrying? Quarrying is the process of collecting stones from the natural rock surfaces. Site selection and methods used for quarrying for construction works is discussed. Quarrying of stone is completely different from mine. Mine belongs to underground operation only whereas quarry is carried out on exposed surface of natural rocks.

## Quarrying | Process and Equipment | Applications | Epiroc US
Quarrying is used mainly in the production of construction and building materials, such as solid stone or crushed rock for aggregates, or for raw materials for processes such as cement manufacture. As a technique, quarrying is normally only used where raw materials of adequate quality and size cannot be obtained economically by other means.
