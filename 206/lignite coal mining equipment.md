## Lignite Coal Mining Equipment
Lignite Coal Mining Equipment. A coal dryer for lignite should include explosion venting a water deluge system and possibly an inert gas or a recirculated selfinerted process gas conversely anthracite coal exhibits a high ignition temperature rendering explosion vents or a deluge system in the coal dryer unnecessary carrier coal dryers can treat.

## Lignite Coal - IspatGuru
Lignite coal mining has several environmental issues related to its mining. These issues are described below. Since the calorific value of lignite coal is low, the quantity of coal needed is high. Lignite coal's high moisture content and lower carbon content results in more carbon dioxide emissions than harder black coals.

There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high

Germany has been the largest lignite producer in the world since the beginning of industrial lignite mining. It still is, followed by China, Russia, and the United States. The softer and moister lignite (also called brown or soft coal) has a lower calorific value than hard coal and can only be mined in opencast operations. When burned, it is more CO2 intensive than hard coal.
