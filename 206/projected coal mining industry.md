## The Future Of Coal | Inside Energy
Between federal regulations to restrict carbon dioxide emissions and mercury pollution, cheap natural gas, and concerns about climate change, the coal industry in this country is under threat. Since 2012 nearly 60 coal-burning power plants have partially or completely shut down. But the dirty fuel still supplies 40% of our power and is critical, proponents say, for maintaining the reliability

## The future of coal in South Africa - Technology for Mining
The South African government has a plan for energy projection up to 2030. The hope is that an additional generating capacity of 9.5 GW of wind, 6.8 GW of solar, 6.7 GW of coal, and 2.5 GW of hydropower will be available by that time. This would still mean that South Africa would still be acquiring 64% of its power from coal.
