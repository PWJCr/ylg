"Also, you want to choke feed the crusher to get maximum production rates and a 360-degree crush." Don't trickle feed the crusher; that will lead to uneven component wear, more irregular product sizes and less production. An inexperienced operator will often reduce the feed rate rather than to simply open the close side setting.
