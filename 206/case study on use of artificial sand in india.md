M Sand is nothing but artificial sand made from crushing of rock or granite for construction purposes in cement or concrete. M sand differs from natural river sand in its physical and mineralogical properties. Sand is one of the important ingredients at making concrete mortar & plaster, etc.. Earth scientists and organizations are now promoting the use of M-Sand(Manufactured Sand).

Aug 15, 2022Artificial sand, also called crushed sand or mechanical sand (m sand), refers to rocks, mine tailings or industrial waste granules with a particle size of less than 4.75 mm. It is processed by mechanical crushing and sieving. In China, the artificial sand was mainly used in the construction of hydropower systems.

## Controlling windblown sand problems by an artificial gravel surface: A 
The current paper presents a case study, by which to develop an artificial gravel surface to protect the Mogao Grottoes from windblown sand problems. The process is completed by conducting a series of in situ measurements of the sand flow over both the original gobi land and several different artificial gravel sites.
