## Adverse Effects of Ore Slime and How to Solve Them
Dec 3, 2020Slime is a kind of solid waste produced by mining, generally refers to 5-10 micron ore particles. The slime has a great adverse effect on the beneficiation process, and it is necessary to treat the slime bearing ore before the beneficiation operation to reduce or eliminate the harmful effects of the slime. We will explain in detail below. 1.

## Is the beneficiation of iron ore slime/ tailings/rejects necessary?
A characterization study of Salem iron ore indicates that the major iron-bearing minerals are hematite, magnetite, and goethite. Samples on average contains (pct) Fe2O3-84.40, Fe (total)-59.02

## Upgradation of Iron Ore Fines and Slime by Selective  - Hindawi
Mar 4, 2022In the case of slime, the stability of the suspension for all surface-active agents at all concentrations and at pH 8 is comparable. However, humate produces a comparatively more stable DP than AD 200 in the case of iron ore fines (Figure 3).The efficacy of sodium humate as an additive in iron ore beneficiation via selective dispersion-cum-settling technique was also reported [].

Current strategies and future challenges on exploration, beneficiation and value addition of iron ore resources with special emphasis on iron ores from Eastern India R. K. Upadhyay and A. S. Venkatesh Eighty per cent of the world's steelmaking is through the blast furnace route and hence the role of iron ore as a raw material and its quality become very critical to achieve steel with the
