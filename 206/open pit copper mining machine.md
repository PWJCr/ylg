## Geology and mining — MineFacts
Open pit mining. One precondition for open pit extraction is that the ore body extends up to the surface or is not covered by an excessively thick layer of soil or rock. In most open pit mines, ore is extracted by so-called benching. The mining method is based on the ore being extracted in "benches" at successively lower levels.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
The first steps of copper processing are the same for both ores: mining and transporting. Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Mining
Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe.The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron.Other precious metals were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through open-pit mining, and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts.
