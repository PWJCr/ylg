## Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company
The Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company (a.k.a. Michigan Limestone) operates the world's largest limestone quarry, which is located near Rogers City, Michigan.It was formed and organized in 1910; however, production did not begin until 1912. Ownership of the quarry has changed a number of times, but it is still one of the country's largest producers of limestone.
