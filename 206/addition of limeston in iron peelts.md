## Effect of adding limestone on the metallurgical properties of iron ore 
In general, the main types of pellets for the purposes of making iron are acid, basic and fluxed. In order to produce high-quality pellets, certain additives are important. The most common fluxing materials for iron ore pellet production are limestone (CaCO 3), dolomite (Ca,Mg(CO 3) 2) and olivine (Mg 2 SiO 4), but sometimes magnesite (MgCO 3

## Effect of limestone and dolomite flux on the quality of pellets using 
Abstract Owing to the depletion of high-grade iron ore quality, many steel plants over the world are now using pellets after beneficiation of low grade ores as blast furnace feed. For the effective utilization of low-grade iron ore resources (59-62% Fe) with high loss of ignition (LOI), mineralogical characteristics play the vital role to improve the process efficiency. The present work
