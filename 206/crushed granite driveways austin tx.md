## The Pros and Cons of Decomposed Granite Driveways
There are many downsides to using unstabilized decomposed granite for a driveway. Without proper stabilization, it is not quite as permeable. It will still drain liquid, but at a much slower rate than if the driveway were to be excavated and stabilized with pavers. Also, it actually encourages weed growth if laid over plain grass.

## Decomposed granite
This was originally ruled out due to cost, but if we do the digging and formwork ourselves, it might be a bit more afordable. Thoughts: 10m3 of concrete $2k, mesh $300, then perhaps 2 concreters for a day to pour and finish $800. This is more expensive, but relieves my fears of erosion and cracks in the granite .
