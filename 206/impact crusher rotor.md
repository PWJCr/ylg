## Numerical Simulation of a Single and Double-Rotor Impact Crusher Using 
Nov 12, 2021Comparing the effects of increasing rotor speed and the addition of the second rotor at the lowest speed has revealed that the lowest speed of the two-rotor design outperformed the highest speed of single-rotor design, and the comparison is depicted in Figure 8. Although the high-speed single rotor produced more impacts than a double-impact

The impact crusher (typically PE series) is widely used and of high production efficiency and good safety performance. The finished product is of cube shape and the tension force and crack is avoided. Compared with hammer crusher, the impact crusher is able to fully utilize the high-speed impact energy of entire rotor.

This invention relates to rotary impact crusher rotors used to communicate rock and to such rotors which are of substantially triangular shape having outlets at the apices of the triangle. This results in a rotor having reduced wearing surfaces and also avoids destruction or explosion of the rotor in the event of an excessive build up of rock in the crusher chamber.

## Impact Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic. An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill). Dynamic impact could be described as material dropping into a rapidly turning rotor where it receives a smashing blow from a hammer or impeller.
