## Gyratory And Cone Crushers - Met Dynamics
Worn liners change the geometry of the crushing chamber and can result in drifting closed side settings, poor throughput, power consumption and product quality. Automatic setting regulation is often used to compensate for liner wear. The KCM can simulate wear in both gyratory and cone crushers, with or without regulated setting controls.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

The walls of the gyratory crusher's hopper are lined with "V-shaped" pieces, the mantle and the concave, like a jaw crusher but shaped like a cone. The ore is discharged through the smaller bottom output hole of the cone. While the cone does not move, an interior crushing movement is created by a revolving shaft on a vertical rod.

CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl, but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary, tertiary and quaternary stages.

The crushing chamber of the gyratory crusher is composed of a moving cone and a fixed cone. When the crusher works, the motor passes the power to the horizontal shaft and a pair of bevel gears through the large and small pulley. The eccentric sleeve is connected with the big bevel gear and the moving cone places in the eccentric sleeve.

## Cone Crusher | Working Principle | Animation | Engineering Intro
Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

## Crushing 101 - Different types of crushers for distinctive needs
Jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers operate according to the compression principle. Impact crushers, in turn, utilize the impact principle. Another way to classify the equipment is according to the stage where they are allocated in processing. For instance jaw or gyratory crushers in primary crushing and cone crushers in secondary

## Gyratory and Cone Crusher - ScienceDirect
Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1]. The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.
