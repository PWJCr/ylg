## Stamp Mill - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
When stamp mills are used for dry crushing, double discharge mortars are provided (see Fig. 50), and the screens are put low down, giving a small depth of discharge. These arrangements are necessitated by the difficulty of discharging the crushed ore from the mortar, the only means of doing this being the dashing of the dry ore against the screens, due to the fall of the stamps.

## Stamp Mills for Processing Gold Silver Copper Ore - Gold Rush Nuggets
A stamp mill is a large mechanical device used to crush ore and extract the desired metals from the host material. It uses heavy steel stamps to crush and break apart material, releasing the valuable gold from worthless rock, allowing for the extraction of gold for further refining. The basic design of a stamp mill has been used for thousands

## Stamp Mill - Digital-Desert
Stamp Mill A stamp mill was a mechanical crusher, noisy, heavy and somewhat awkward to operate. The stamps were heavy metal weights that were lifted and dropped on the ore by a crankshaft. The crushed ore would then be further refined, usually by a mercury or cyanide process. The process explained:
