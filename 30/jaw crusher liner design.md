Rocksizer Jaw Crushers. RockSizer primary stage jaw crushers feature the upthrust toggle action which is also common to the StoneSizer range. Developed by Parker, this gives a slight downward movement to the swing jaw that promotes a forced feed and therefore increased output while at the same time minimising any rubbing action resulting in a well shaped product and reduced and even wear on

## Tips for maintaining efficiency in crushing circuits - Quarry
A jaw crusher is a compression-type of crusher. Material is reduced by squeezing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece. The setting or the space between those two pieces of steel controls the discharge size. The tighter the setting, the smaller the output size and the lower the throughput capacity.

For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.
