## Materials conveyors: A guide for specifying belt conveyor systems
The first step in the design of a belt conveyor with a specified conveyor capacity is to determine the speed and width of the belt. The magnitude of the belt speed can be determined using: equation. Where: C = Conveyor capacity. r = Material density (kg/m3) V = Belt speed (m/s) A = Conveyor's belt cross-sectional area.

Belt Conveyors from LVP Conveyor Systems Ltd. are an ideal materials handling solution for goods with irregular surfaces and are therefore not suitable for roller conveyors. Products can be conveyed directly on to the belt so both regular and irregular shaped objects, large or small, light and heavy, can be transported successfully.
