A. Hi Chris. To remove silica stains a product needs hydrofluoric acid or at least fluoride salts of some sort, and is therefore dangerous stuff. But if you search Amazon or other sites you will find water stain removers that claim to remove silica; then you can look up their SDS and you will find the fluoride listed.
