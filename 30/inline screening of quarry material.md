The screening at this time is called pre-screening. For sand and gravel production plants, pre-screening can avoid ineffective crushing of materials, thereby increasing the production capacity of crushing equipment and reducing power consumption. Adding a screen on hopper or a special vibrating screen both are the ideal pre-screening equipment. 2.
