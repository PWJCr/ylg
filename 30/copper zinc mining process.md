Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

Black pipe is the preferred material by many plumbers, although galvanized pipes are also used.galvanized pipe Galvanized pipes are basically steel pipes which have been coated with a layer of zinc. This is done to improve their properties by keeping off moisture and oxygen which causes corrosion. Natural gas will not corrode steel pipes.

## Zinc | Geoscience Australia
Zinc (Zn) was used in Rome and China more than 2000 years ago as a component of brass which is a zinc-copper alloy. The Romans and Chinese smelted zinc ores such as calamine (zinc carbonate) with copper to produce brass, used for coins, containers, armour and jewellery. They did not actually realise that zinc was a metal.

In order to model the full cradle-to-gate production process for primary zinc, a key assumption is the combination of the zinc mining and concentration sites with the zinc-smelting sites. Zinc concentrate is sold as a commodity, so depending on market forces, a zinc smelter may process zinc concentrate from a variety of mines.

Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Archeologists have also found evidence of mining and annealing of the abundant native copper in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States dating back to 5,000 B.C. Native copper was likely used first, as it did not require any process to purify it. It could have been hammered into shapes although it would have been very brittle.
