##  Limestone Quarrying and Processing: A Life-Cycle Inventory
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate with the occasional presence of magnesium. Most limestone is biochemical in origin meaning the calcium carbonate in the stone originated from shelled oceanic creatures. Limestone can also be chemical in origin as is the case with travertine.

Limestone when heated starts decomposing into lime (CaO) and carbon di-oxide (CO2) at 810 deg C. The process is called calcination of limestone. It is a thermal treatment process which is carried out for the thermal decomposition of the raw limestone for the removal of LOI (loss on ignition) or carbon di-oxide (CO2) part of its composition.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores, either run-of-mine, milled, autoclaved or roasted, are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution, keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.

## How Does Organic Limestone Form - Realonomics
How is limestone formed and where is it found? Most fresh water and sea water contain dissolved calcium carbonate.
