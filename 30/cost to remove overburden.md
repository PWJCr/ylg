It costs money to remove the overburden, and in the simplest terms, the cost of removing the overburden cannot exceed the value of the coal that is exposed. The stripping ratio is usually taken as the volume of the overburden that must be removed to the weight of the coal that is exposed when this volume of overburden is removed.

## Overburden definition — AccountingTools
Aug 7, 2022Stripping costs are incurred when removing overburden in order to obtain access to a commercially-producible mineral deposit. If this occurs during the development phase of a mine, and the activity provides better access to the deposit, then the cost should be capitalized. If not, then the stripping cost should be charged to expense as incurred.

## Overburden Removal Cost and How Containment Affects It - BTL Liners

Ideal ratios of weight between overburden and valuable sand or raw ore vary depending on the value of the desired material. A low-grade coal deposit will need a far lower ratio than a high value mineral or ore.
