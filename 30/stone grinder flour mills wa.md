1. Mounting to a solid surface. A manual grain mill must be mounted to a table or counter top. 2. Time. It takes much longer to grind up your flour with a manual mill than an electric one, especially if you need to grind up a large amount at one sitting. 3. Weight. Some manual grain mills weigh up to 20 pounds.
