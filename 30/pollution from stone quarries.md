## Development of an Effective Method for Preventing Dust Pollution in 
The paper presents a new method for preventing dust pollution in stone quarries using naphthenic wastes of petroleum refineries. The method is based on the use of naphthenate solutions of metals as wetting agents to minimize dust release during stone-cutting process. The studies were carried out in one of the stone quarries of the Absheron peninsula.
