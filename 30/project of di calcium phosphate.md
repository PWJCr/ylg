## Di-Calcium Phosphate - Halal Gelatin
Di-Calcium Phosphate. Dicalcium phosphate is the calcium phosphate with the method CaHPO₄ and its dihydrate. The "di" prefix inside the not unusual call arises because the formation of the HPO₄2- anion includes the removal of two protons from phosphoric acid, H₃PO₄. Top quality manufacturing labs. Multiple uses. Experienced

## Bone Ash (Di-Calcium Phosphate) (priced per lb.) - Laguna Clay Company 
An important source of calcium phosphate made from calcined cattle bones. Real bone ash is chemically inert and free of organic matters. Calcium acts as a flux, and phosphorous as a glass former. Melting point 1670°C Commonly used in commercial porcelains known as bone china, where it lowers the maturing temperature and adds translucency.
