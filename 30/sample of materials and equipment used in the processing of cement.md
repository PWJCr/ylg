Classification: High Calcium Marl: CaO ≥ 45% ; Low calcium marl: CaO <45%. In some places, the composition of marl is close to the raw material for making cement. It can be directly fired into cement, which is called natural cement rock. Main mineral is calcite. White peony: also named chalk, it is a mixture of shells and of marine organisms.

## Cement processing equipment - Machinery Partner
Cement waste usually goes through 2 stages of processing; 1. Breaking and size reduction, 2. Sorting. Things like hydraulic breakers, crushers and shredders are used to break the material down from large chunks into a more useful size. Screeners, magnets and separators and then used to remove larger pieces, metal, or plastics.

## Raw materials - Understanding Cement
The most common raw rock types used in cement production are: Limestone (supplies the bulk of the lime) Clay, marl or shale (supplies the bulk of the silica, alumina and ferric oxide) Other supplementary materials such as sand, fly ash/pulverised fuel ash (PFA), or ironstone to achieve the desired bulk composition.
