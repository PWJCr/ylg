Kaolin dry beneficiation process. The kaolinite dry mining process is a simple and economical process. The ore is crushed to 25.4mm by a hammer crusher and fed into the cage mill to reduce the particle size to 6.35mm.  The beneficiation and processing of kaolin is divided into two processes: dry method and wet method.
