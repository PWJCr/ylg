## What Are The Most Common Minerals - Realonomics
The five most common mineral groups in rock are the silicates carbonates sulfates halides and oxides. There are about 4000 known minerals in the Earth's crust and about 92 % of them are silicates.  There are currently nearly 5000 minerals known to science but only a few dozen are common enough to be found widespread throughout the Earth

## Where to find minerals - The Mineral and Gemstone Kingdom
The best place to find minerals is at mine s. Mines are locations where industrially important rocks, minerals, and ore s, as well as precious metal s and gemstones are extracted from the earth. Mines can produce large amounts of specimens of certain minerals, and continue to provide specimens as long as the mine is actively worked.

## Where mineral resources are found in nigeria?
Where can mineral resources be found? Minerals can be found throughout the world in the earth's crust but usually in such small amounts that they not worth extracting. Only with the help of certain geological processes are minerals concentrated into economically viable deposits. Mineral deposits can only be extracted where they are found.

Mineral Resources. Minerals are naturally-occurring, homogeneous geological formations. Unlike fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, minerals are inorganic compounds, meaning they are not formed of animal or plant matter. Metals make up a large portion of the Earth's crust (courtesy Alcan Aluminum Ltd).

The seafloor contains deposits of minerals that we we use in everyday life such as copper, zinc, nickel, gold, silver, and phosphorus. These deposits occur as crusts on volcanic and other rocks and as nodules on abyssal plain sediment that are typically about 3 to 10 centimeters (1 to 4 inches) in diameter.

S.K. Haldar, Josip Tišljar, in Introduction to Mineralogy and Petrology, 2014 1.5 Mineral Resources. Mineral resource is the mineral deposit consisting of useful concentration that may or may not exceed economic cost for obtaining the valuable minerals. The technological process, the needs of the economy and prices in the market, depends on whether and when the rock/mineral becomes raw material.
