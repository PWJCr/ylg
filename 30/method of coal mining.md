## Basic Information about Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia
Layers of rock and dirt above and between the coal seams are removed. Coal seams are removed with excess soil and rock placed in an adjacent valley. Large scale earth moving equipment is used to excavate and remove coal from lower layers. The equipment used depends on the method and scale of the surface mining method being employed.

## coal mining | Definition, History, Types, & Facts | Britannica
coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

A special problem in coal mines was the methane (a gas) that sometimes accompanied coal, and which could--and too often did--catch fire and explode.  Without electric fans, some other method of ventilating the mine was necessary. The answer was the ventilating furnace. Quite literally, early coal mines had a furnace at the bottom of a shaft

Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two main methods of mining coal. Depth, density, and thickness of the coal seam are the factors that are taken into account while selecting the mining method for coal extraction.

More specifically, mining is used to extract non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals and even water. There are four main methods of mining: underground, surface, placer and in-situ. The type of mining method used depends on the kind of resource that is being targeted for extraction, the deposit's location below or on the Earth's

The highest coal recovery is normally achieved when retreat mining is combined with room-and-pillar mining. This method is often referred to as room-and-pillar with retreat mining. Retreat mining is a systematic removal of coal support pillars once a mining section has been developed using standard room-and-pillar mining.

The second fundamental method of extracting coal is underground mining. This technique is used when the coal is buried deep inside the earth. The machines used for this type of coal extraction can excavate at depths of more than thousand feet. The coal itself is cut out from rocks using machinery. It is brought to the top using massive conveyor
