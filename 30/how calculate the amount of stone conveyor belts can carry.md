## How to calculate the maximum operating tension of conveyor belt?
May 11, 2022Maximum operating tension (tight side tension) can now be computed by T1=Te + T2 times the starting factor (1.5, 2.0, 3.0 etc.). Electric motors may have very high starting torques. CEMA recommends the use of a starting factor (multiplier) to compensate in calculations. In the quick method we equate maximum operating tension to tight side

## What causes materials carry-back of belt conveyor? - SKE
It may cause conveyor belt misalignment. Carry-back build up on conveyor hardware causes belt mistracking, conveyor belt and structural damage, and is a major cause of material spillage. Fugitive material may bury idlers, conveyor components, or structural supports, requiring expensive clean-up labour and replacement parts.
