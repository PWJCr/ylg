## Dolomite: Identification, Pictures & Info for Rockhounds
Dolomite rock (or dolostone) is, by definition, made of over 50% calcium-magnesium carbonate (the mineral dolomite), usually in the form of well-defined crystals. Some calcite is also possible as a remnant of the dolomite's precursor, limestone. Fossils are common in dolomite, especially sea shells and coral.

## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Purposes - JM Fertilizo
Dolomite as a mineral has very few uses. However, dolostone has an enormous number of uses because it occurs in deposits that are large enough to mine. The most common use for dolostone is in the construction industry. It is crushed and sized for use as a road base material, an aggregate in concrete and asphalt, railroad ballast, rip-rap, or fill.

Dolomite as another abundant magnesium resource is widely distributed and has larger deposits than magnesite. This paper aims to replace magnesite with dolomite as raw materials to reduce the cost in MPC production. Quartz powders were also introduced in the calcination process to chemically combine with CaO components in dolomite.

## Dolomite: A sedimentary rock known as dolostone or dolomite rock - Geology
Dolomite, also known as " dolostone " and " dolomite rock," is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite, CaMg (CO 3) 2. Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide. It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater. Dolomite and limestone are very similar

## Dolomite and dolomitization model- a short review
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, ideally CaMg (CO 3) 2 . The term is also used for a sedimentary carbonate rock composed mostly of the mineral dolomite. An alternative name sometimes used for the dolomitic rock type is dolostone. Dolomite is an unusual carbonate mineral.

Limestone frequently contains magnesium carbonate, either as dolomite CaCO3.Mg CO3 or magnesite (MgCO3) mixed with calcite. Such rocks are termed as 'dolomitic' or 'magnesian' limestone. The mineral calcite is normally white or gray but impurities either within or between the calcite particles can make a limestone brown, yellow, bluish

## Processing Dolomite Into Magnesium Sulfate
Dolomite is mainly used to produce chemical raw materials such as magnesium sulfate and light magnesium carbonate. 30 dilute sulfuric acid and dolomite are mixed reacted separated and concentrated in a certain proportion calcium sulfate is precipitated under temperature rise conditions and the obtained magnesium sulfate solution is cooled.

## How is dolomite used today?145
Score: 4.7/5 (36 votes) . Dolomite is used as a source of magnesium metal and of magnesia (MgO), which is a constituent of refractory bricks. Dolostone is often used instead of limestone as an aggregate for both cement and bitumen mixes and also as a flux in blast furnaces.

## Magnesium carbonate
The primary use of magnesium carbonate is the production of magnesium oxide by calcining. Magnesite and dolomite minerals are used to produce refractory bricks. MgCO 3 is also used in flooring, fireproofing, fire extinguishing compositions, cosmetics, dusting powder, and toothpaste.
