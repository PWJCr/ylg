The rodded unit weight is computed in kg/m 3 (lb/ft 3) from the net weight of the rodded aggregates in the bucket divided by its volume. Computations. Calculate the rodded unit weight as follows: M SSD = (G â T)(1 + A/100)/V. M SSD = the rodded unit weight of the saturated surface dry aggregate, kg/m3 (lb/ft3)

## Coarse Aggregate Specific Gravity - Pavement Interactive
Overview. The coarse aggregate specific gravity test (Figure 1) is used to calculate the specific gravity of a coarse aggregate sample by determining the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water. It is similar in nature to the fine aggregate specific gravity test.

The material below 475 mm size refers to fine aggregate The percentage of all types of harmful matter in fine aggregate should not surpass 5% The maximum size may be 20 cm for mass concrete, such as in dams etc and 63 mm for plain cement concrete work Bulk Density = Weight of aggregate / Container of unit volume Unit: Kg/m 3 or lb

## Density of Cement, Sand and Aggregate, Bulk Density of Aggregate
When sand is in wet conditions, water is present in sand particles that change material quantity in the volume. The average density of sand in a different state is as follows: Loose Sand Density: 1442 Kg/m3. Dry Sand Density: 1602 Kg/m3. Packed Sand Density: 1682 Kg/m3. Packed Sand Density: 2082 Kg/m3.
