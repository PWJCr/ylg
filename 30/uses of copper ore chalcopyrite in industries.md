Dec 12, 2021Copper occurs naturally on the ground or in minerals such as bornite and chalcopyrite. It is mined using the open-pit method or underground mining method. When copper is contained in other minerals (bornite or chalcopyrite), it can be extracted using the electrolysis process.  In the locomotive industry, copper is used in making radiators

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Chalcopyrite - the Peacock Ore. Chalcopyrite is the most important copper ore, and it is the primary source of many popular secondary copper minerals. It can occur in a variety of environments and forms, from hydrothermal veins to sedimentary layers. Nice chalcopyrite crystals are highly sought after by collectors.

In terms of flotation mechanism, the most commonly used collector for flotation chalcopyrite is xanthate, and high-grade xanthate is suitable for flotation of hard-to-float copper-sulfur ore.Ethyl xanthate belongs to low-grade xanthate. Although the selectivity is good, it is beneficial to improve the concentrate grade, but the control of the recovery rate is relatively poor.

Copper ore is a collection of copper sulfides or oxides and other minerals. Reacts with sulfuric acid to produce blue-green copper sulfate. In nature, there are more than 280 minerals containing copper, mainly 16 types. Among them, natural copper, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, azurite, malachite and other minerals are more common.

The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ~50% copper. What is copper ore used for? Most copper mined today is used to conduct electricity - mostly as wiring. It is also an excellent conductor of heat and is used in cooking utensils heat sinks and heat exchangers.

## Copper: Mineral information, data and localities.
Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals (such as chalcopyrite or chalcocite) and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode. An increasing share of copper is produced from acid leaching

Important to note that from the geological logging of the core, the higher copper grades over significant drilled widths in Texas West appear to be controlled by the increased abundance of chalcopyrite, which is a common copper sulphide mineral, often extractable through conventional flotation methods.

## Difference Between Pyrite and Chalcopyrite
It also uses to produce sulfuric acid by thermally decomposing pyrite (FeS 2) into iron (II) sulfide (FeS) and then to elemental sulfur at 540 °C; at 1 atm. Chalcopyrite: In industrial scale, chalcopyrite is mainly used as the main copper source. Even it mainly has only one usage; it is considered as very important since copper wires are used
