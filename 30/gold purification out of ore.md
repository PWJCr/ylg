## Metallurgy - Purification of ores - BrainKart
The ore is generally associated with rock impurities like clay, sand etc. called ' gangue or matrix'. The purification of ore means removal of gangue from the powdered ore. This process is otherwise called concentration of the ore or ore dressing. Thus, the percentage of the ore in the concentrated ore is higher than that in the original ore.
