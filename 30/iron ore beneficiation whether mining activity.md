## More high grade iron ore needed to accelerate steel decarbonisation - IEEFA
27 June 2022 (IEEFA): Decarbonising the steel industry will require an increase in high grade iron ore production and improved beneficiation techniques, finds a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). To reach net zero emissions by 2050, steelmakers must switch production methods from blast furnaces

Minerals such as iron ore and coal can serve as a stimulus for economic growth. Steel which is derived from iron ore is fundamental to infrastructure development and investment. At the moment, the bulk of steel used in real estate and infrastructural (road and bridge construction) development in Nigeria is imported.

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.
