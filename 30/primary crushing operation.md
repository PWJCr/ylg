 NCDEQ - Primary Crushing. The primary crusher in this quarry was initially located on the surface. As the quarry was deepened, the primary crusher was relocated to the bottom of the quarry to minimize noise. The yellow device (left and below) is used to reduce the size of oversize rock so that it will enter the primary crusher.

Primary Crushing. The purpose of the primary crusher is to reduce the ROM ore to a size amenable for feeding the secondary crusher or the SAG mill grinding circuit. The ratio of reduction through a primary crusher can be up to about 8:1. Feed: ROM up to 1.5 m; Product: -300mm (for transport) to -200mm (for SAG mill) Feed Rate: 160 to 13,000 tph

## Grizzly bars and feeders improve primary crushing efficiency
Primary Crushing. The primary jaw crusher is the first stage of processing in most sand, gravel, and mining operations. Material that has been excavated from the ground (Pit run) or blasted (Shot Rock) is fed to a large crusher, typically a jaw crusher, where it is crushed down to a manageable size for further processing.

## Primary And Secondary Crushing - Crusher Mills
Primary crushing roller breaking space instead of increasing the secondary crusher, but the wear is too severe, the finished product size, . Secondary Crusher To Clay.  The first stage in most aggregate production operations is the reduction and sizing by crushing. Impact crushers may be used as primary, secondary, or tertiary crushers
