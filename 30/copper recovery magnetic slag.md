It is economical to turn off fluorescent lights if they are not being used. According to the Certified Ballast Manufacturers Association, the average magnetic ballast lasts about 75,000 hours, or 12 to 15 years, with normal use. The optimum economic life of a fluorescent lighting system with magnetic ballasts is usually about 15 years.

## Smelting reduction and kinetics analysis of magnetic iron in copper 
The magnetic iron in the copper slag gradually transformed to fayalite, and the viscosity of the copper molten slag decreased as the magnetic iron content decreased during the reduction process. The reduction of magnetic iron in the copper molten slag using waste cooking oil was a first-order reaction, and the rate-limiting step was the mass

Copper smelting slag is produced from copper pyrometallurgy (both smelting and converting stages), usually grading at 0.3-3%. The slag may also contains lead & zinc minerals like galena, sphalerite. Copper mainly dwells in the slag in the form of bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite, and metallic copper. The rest are iron minerals like magnetic

On the one hand, copper slag is nowadays a waste in copper pyrometallurgy despite the significant quantities of iron (>40 wt. %) and copper (1 to 2 wt. %). On the other hand, solar energy, when properly concentrated, offers great potential in high-temperature processes. Therefore, concentrated solar power (CSP) could be used in the treatment of copper slag to transform fayalite into
