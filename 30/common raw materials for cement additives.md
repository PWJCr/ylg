## Asphalt Additives - Pavement Interactive
Additives. Asphalt additives are any of a number of substances that can be added to the asphalt binder to alter the characteristics of the final blend of HMA.. Sasol. Sasol production meets about 30% of South Africa's transportation fuel needs. There are two major plants in South Africa, one at Sasolburg, which is a natural gas raw feed, (formerly coal) and one at Secunda, which is a coal

## Cement Additive - Sika
Cement additives are materials added to cement for the optimization of the cement properties and the cement grinding process. Cement additives are classified into different product groups such as grinding aids, strength enhancers and performance enhancers.  Each individual cement plant has different characteristics of local raw materials

Concrete Admixtures: Air-Entrainment. Air entrained concrete can increase the freeze-thaw durability of concrete. This type of admixture produces a more workable concrete than non-entrained concrete while reducing bleeding and segregation of fresh concrete. Improved resistance of concrete to severe frost action or freeze/thaw cycles.

## Explained: Cement vs. concrete — their differences, and opportunities 
Since concrete is the most popular material in the world and cement is the primary binder used in concrete, these two sources of CO 2 are the main reason that cement contributes around 8 percent of global emissions. CSHub's Executive Director Jeremy Gregory, however, sees concrete's scale as an opportunity to mitigate climate change.
