## Calculating Floor Load Capacity for Your Business
This calculation is the total weight that a floor can support over a specific area. In the United States, this measurement is expressed as pounds per square foot (psf). Your floors should be engineered to handle live and dead loads. With these calculations, you will know the weight limits of your particular space.

## Cast in Place Concrete Estimating
For accurate concrete estimating, the estimator must consider each of the following major components individually: formwork, reinforcing steel, ready-mix concrete, placement of the concrete mix, finishing of the surface, and curing. Formwork - A primary cost for cast-in-place concrete is forming. Most jobs today are constructed with

## Precast Concrete: The Advantages And The Disadvantages - eSUB
Here's a brief rundown: -The precast concrete is controlled into a mold made of wood or steel. The molds generally also have either rebar, wire mesh, or prestressed cables present. It all depends on the final application. -The concrete is cured in a controlled environment as opposed to on-site or where it will eventually be.

Here, the average cost can range anywhere from $6 to as much as $15 per square foot. Structural precast can range from $43 per linear foot for a 15-foot span to as much as $95 per linear foot for a 30-foot span. These are the costs for the material only and won't include the labor. Since precast concrete can be formed into just about anything.

## Concrete Cost Calculator | Estimate Concrete Slab Cost
The average cost of a concrete slab (6 inches thick) is $5.00-5.50 per square foot, including materials and labor. However, the price can go up to $9-10 per square foot depending on numerous factors and enhancement costs. Thus, your cost to pave a 2-car driveway of 16 feet wide, and 40 feet long (640 sq.ft.) will be about $3,200 - 3,520.
