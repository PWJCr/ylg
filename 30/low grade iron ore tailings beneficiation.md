## low grade iron ore tailings beneficiation
 As high-grade iron ore deposits are gradually being depleted, more difficult-to-process ores such as goethite-rich, low-grade iron ores and tailings are now being processed. These ores often contain impurities and require some form of beneficiation in order to achieve the typical grades required for sale to downstream steel producers.

In this paper, iron recovery from IOTs was studied at different points during a process involving pre-concentration followed by direct reduction and magnetic separation. Then, slag-tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high-silica residues. Based on the

## CNB - Beneficiation process of low-grade magnetite and 
The invention relates to the technical field of black metal ore exploitation and beneficiation, in particular to a beneficiation process of low-grade magnetite and specularite mixed ore, which is especially suitable for associated magnetite and specularite mixed ore of Zhouyoufang iron ore. The novel beneficiation process is realized according to an operation procedure and the process
