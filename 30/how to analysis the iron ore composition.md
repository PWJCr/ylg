The cost of getting iron ore in and out of the Great Lakes is simply too high for any major trade to take place with the rest of the world. Therefore, the USA remains a very marginal player in the seaborne iron ore market. In 2019, seaborne iron ore exports are expected to be ~3 Mt, which accounts for ~0.2% of global seaborne trade.

## Archaeometallurgical slag
Archaeometallurgical slag is slag discovered and studied in the context of archaeology.Slag, the byproduct of iron-working processes such as smelting or smithing, is left at the iron-working site rather than being moved away with the product.As it weathers well, it is readily available for study. The size, shape, chemical composition and microstructure of slag are determined by features of the
