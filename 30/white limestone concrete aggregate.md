## The Suitability Of Limestone Aggregates For Use In Structural Concrete
Limestone Aggregate in Asphaltic Concrete. Limestone aggregate is also generally suitable for use in Asphaltic Concrete and is economically feasible when the absorption is relatively low (Less than 2.5%). High absorption rates may result in added asphalt binder needed to allow for asphalt absorbed by the aggregate. However, if used in a wearing

## Sand or gravel under concrete slabyrelax.shop
Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.
