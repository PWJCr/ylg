## Limestone
Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes, though biological processes, such as the accumulation of corals and shells in the sea, have likely been more important for the last 540 million years.

The majority of people are unaware that wine, although made from grapes, may have been made using animal-derived products. During the winemaking process, the liquid is filtered through substances called "fining agents." This process is used to remove protein, yeast, cloudiness, "off" flavors and colorings, and other organic particles.

The greater the weathering of limestone, the more CO2 is removed from the atmosphere. As limestone dissolves faster than silicate rocks, the chemical weathering of limestone accounts for more of the total chemical erosion of the land surface than any other rocks, even though much larger areas of the Earth consist of silicate rocks.

How coal is formed. Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the plant matter transforms from moist, low-carbon peat, to coal, an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.

## Uses of limestone - Know About the Different Uses of Limestone - BYJUS
Limestone in powdered form is also used as a substance to absorb pollutants or control coal mine dust at many coal-mining facilities. Lime which is the byproduct of limestone is used to neutralise acids and treat wastewater, industrial sludge, animal waste, and water supplies. These are some popular uses of limestone.

## Clay
Clay is a type of fine-grained natural soil material containing clay minerals. Clays develop plasticity when wet, due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles, but become hard, brittle and non-plastic upon drying or firing. Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured, but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, such as a reddish or brownish colour

Biocement is a reversal of this process, where carbon and calcium are combined to produce a biologically formed limestone material.
