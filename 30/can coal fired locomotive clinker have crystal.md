## Wood vs coal in steam locomotives : trains - reddit
Coal burns hotter and more efficiently (10-15k BTU per lb vs 3k BTU per lb), allowing for more energy to build up steam, which is why pretty much everyone made the switch. Coal burning locomotives can burn wood (if fact that's a good way to start the fire in the first place since coal is hard to light), but not the other way around.

Coal that contains more water, along with minerals like calcium, sodium, potassium, pyrite or iron, can break down inside the coal and mix with air, moisture and each other.

I am awaiting some Allen Ten-wheeler castings, and originally was going to build a D&RG coal-fired loco. I have switched prototypes, and now am headed for a 419 class ATSF loco. Early on many were coal-fired, but most were converted to fuel. I am still mulling coal. Having run oil-fired locos, I have a definite comfort level there. Read More

## ash removal?
This ash was stored appart from the clinker, but also was used in building purposes, were it was often used as filling material. Some hard clinker layers on the grate had to be broken of with hooks or hoes, a hard work after a hard daily service, and pulled into the ashpan. The ashpan cooler can be used to flush the cinders out of the ashpan.

## Suggestions for a reputable coal fired locomotive builder
In fact it is called the former because it acts in place of the steam blower until the locomotive can provide its own draught. Drop the firebox door and start to fill the large firebox with your soaked charcoal. I always put in a coupla shovels full of coal as well as I build up the charcoal to sill level.
