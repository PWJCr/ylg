## Carbide Slag as Raw Material - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Carbide slag, also known as calcium carbide residue (CCR), is a by-product of the hydrolysis of calcium carbide. It is commonly generated from the industrial production of ethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other products as a solid waste. Currently, it has no value for recovery and is commonly landfilled. At some Chinese plants, this slag is used as an alternative raw material for cement
