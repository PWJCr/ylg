## Energy-Dependent Particle Size Distribution Models for Multi-Disc Mill
Comminution is important in the processing of biological materials, such as cereal grains, wood biomass, and food waste. The most popular biomaterial grinders are hammer and roller mills. However, the grinders with great potential in the processing of biomass are mills that use cutting, e.g., disc mills. When it comes to single-disc and multi-disc grinders, there are not many studies

##  Thermal energy consumption and its conservation for a cement production 
The consumption of the energy in the cement plant is mainly due to raw mill, cooler, pre-heater and rotary kiln [14]. The total energy loss of the plant is generally accounted for about 35-39% of the total energy input [15]. This energy loss is due to the loss from the exhaust gas, cooler and the radiation heat transfer from the kiln cell.
