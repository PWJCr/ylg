Sacking a new concrete wall serves two purposes: It makes the finish very smooth, and it makes the color uniform. When you pour new concrete, small holes, crevices, and other defects are inevitable and need to be filled. Oftentimes, the fill material and the original concrete have slightly different colors, and sacking is a remedy for that.

Dry grinding creates huge amounts of dust, while wet grinding produces huge amounts of water and slurry. Honing (50-grit to 200-grit) is much faster when done with water, which flushes the cuttings, improving surface finish as well as the tool's life span.

A.: We posed the question to Leo Swan of Equipment Development Company, Inc. Leo says you can usually start grinding within 8 hours of placement. Watch for tearing of aggregate particles and stop grinding if this happens. A rake finish probably will have furrow depths of 3/8 inch or so; grooves in a broom finish generally don't exceed 1/32 inch.

That would make the most sense.Grinding down exposed aggregate just seems like opening a can of worms.

Grinding concrete produces plenty of dust and debris. After you finish the last pass with a grinding disc, suck up as much material as possible with a wet-dry vac. Some concrete grinders come with an integrated vacuum, which you should definitely use while grinding. Even in this case, though, use a wet-dry vac when you're done grinding.

## concrete - Is it normal to use a grinder to finish a new driveway 
Ordinary concrete mixes or cement cannot be used as an "overlay" or skim coat as it requires much thickness for strength. Specialty modified cement mixes, in pails or pumped, are required to obtain adhesion and compressive strength in thin overlays. These are expensive. Grinding concrete requires diamond wheels and is laughable in this situation.
