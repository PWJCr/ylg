Types of Construction Wastes and Recycling Strategies. 1. Brick. Brick wastes are generated as a result of demolition, and may be contaminated with mortar and plaster. Brick wastes are sometimes blended with other materials like timber and concrete. Currently, bricks are recycled by crushing and using as filling materials.

## Study on Strength Enhancement Factors of Cement-Stabilized Recycled 
Previous research studies have primarily focused on waste concrete aggregates. However, due to the demolition of a large number of brick-concrete structures, a large amount of brick slag is produced. Therefore, the mixed recycled aggregate containing bricks and pure recycled brick aggregate are taken as the research objects in this study.
