## Fineness of Cement and Concrete Quality - Concrete Construction
A.: The fineness of cement usually affects the rate at which cement gains strength. It may also have a minor effect on workability but probably not much. If you took a cement and ground part of it to a greater fineness the finer portion would produce higher early strength than the other portion. Fineness cannot by itself, however, be taken as

Total weight of concrete ingredients = 50+115+209+27.5 = 401.5 say 400 kg. Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum. No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require. 1.Cement = 6 bags

## Fineness modulus of sand used in a concrete mixing plant
Fine crushed stone with different Fineness modulus was prepared and used for each concrete mix. The required fineness modulus was achieved by sieving the crushed stone using automatic sieve shaker to maintain the required quantity of retained crushed stone size on each standard sieve. Fineness modulus of 2.4, 2.6, 2.75, 2.92 and 3 were prepared

## How To Calculate Fineness Modulus Of Crusher Dust
The bulk density of ROBO sand or crusher dust is 1768 kg/m3. The specific gravity and fineness modulus of ROBO sand are 2.66 and 2.88 respectively. Fineness modulus is an empirical factor obtained by adding the cumulative percentages of aggregate retained on each of the standard sieves ranging from 80 mm to 150 micron and dividing this sum by 100.

To make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete. The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is 1:1.5:3 that mean 1 part of cement, 1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing.

##  Suitability of Crushed Manufactured Sand for Replacement of Natural 
sand resources are increasingly depleted and its cost is becoming increasingly high [15,16]. Properties of aggregate affect the durability and performance of concrete, so fine aggregate is an essential component of concrete and cement mortar. The most commonly used fine aggregate is a natural river or pit sand.
