This study investigates the hydration of dolomite, CaMg(CO{sub 3}){sub 2}, with calcined clay in presence of calcium hydroxide and ordinary Portland cement. The hydration products as well as the microstructure at various ages were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP).

## Frontiers | Automated mineralogy (SEM-EDS) approach to sandstone 
Dolomite (D) occurs as dispersed crystals with ferroan-dolomite (Df) rims. Calcite (Ca) cement sits on top of ferroan dolomite suggesting that calcite was the last carbonate cement to devlop. Gypsum cement (GA) has developed after the ferroan dolomite and calcite and this sulphate cement has here occluded most of the pores.
