## Apologize For Missing an Event or For Overlooking or  - WriteExpress
Example Letter #1. Copied! I feel terrible about not mentioning the contribution your group made to our fall festival last month. In my attempt to single out the newcomers for some recognition, I simply overlooked the chorus. Your group has always been such a major part of the event that I guess I have almost taken them for granted. I apologize.
