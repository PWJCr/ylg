## Difference between Open Circuit and Closed Circuit Grinding Ball Mill 
As a common grinding equipment in cement plants and thermal power plants, ball mills have simple operation in the grinding process and good continuous working performance. The ball mill grinding system is divided into open-circuit grinding and closed-circuit grinding in the process. Many manufacturers have questions about these two systems when choosing.
