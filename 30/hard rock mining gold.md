## Hard Rock Mining Tour - Boulder County
Hard rock mining was Boulder County's leading industry, attracting the majority of new residents to the mineral-rich mountains during the boom of the late 1800s. In 1859 gold was first found in Boulder County near Gold Hill, giving the town its name. More discoveries of gold and silver quickly followed, and with those discoveries came more people.

## What is hardrock mining? - Short-Facts
What was the difference between Placer mining and hard rock mining? Generally as the placers would slowly become exhausted, miners would begin tracing the source of the gold and begin developing hard rock mines. These mines were more labor-intensive than placer mining, but if a rich gold vein was located they could be exceptionally rich to work.

The current mainstream hard rock gold mining process is generally crushing, grinding, gravity separation. Through gravity separation and flotation, concentrates and tailings are extracted, or through chemical methods, after smelting, the products finally become finished gold. The type and extent of gold mining depend on the desired product.

Many pyrite and pyrrhotite minerals contain gold, which is often recovered when extracting copper from lode vein deposits. The purity of gold is stated in terms of fineness and carats (ct). Fineness is defined as the parts per 1000. For example gold with a fineness of 800 means it is 80% pure gold. Alternatively, gold that is 100% pure is 24ct.
