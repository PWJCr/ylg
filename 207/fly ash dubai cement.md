For fly ash use in concrete applications, fineness is defined as the percent by weight of the material retained on the 0.044 mm (No. 325) sieve. A coarser gradation can result in a less reactive ash and could contain higher carbon contents. Limits on fineness are addressed by ASTM and state transportation department specifications.

How Fly Ash Can Affect Concrete Color and Performance Fly ash in concrete is often misunderstood. Because it is a by-product from another industry, many contractors think of fly ash as "filler". They consider it to be simply a low-cost additive that allows the concrete producer to make higher profits while utilizing inferior materials.
