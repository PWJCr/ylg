## mining of feldspar grinder and crusher machine
Feldspar Mining Machine include crusher and grinding mill. Feldspar crusher is the crushing machine that is used in feldspar crushing plant. In the feldspar mine quarry, we usually crush feldspar mine into 40-80 mesh, 80-120 mesh, or more than 120 mesh. Because Moh's hardness of feldspar is about 6, most parts of stone crusher can be used in

Rock Identification Tips. First, decide whether your rock is igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic. Igneous rocks such as granite or lava are tough, frozen melts with little texture or layering. Rocks like these contain mostly black, white and/or gray minerals . Sedimentary rocks such as limestone or shale are hardened sediment with sandy or clay.
