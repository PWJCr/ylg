## Metallic and Nonmetallic Character | Chemistry for Non-Majors 
Summary. Metallic character refers to the level of reactivity of a metal. Non-metallic character relates to the tendency to accept electrons during chemical reactions. Metallic tendency increases going down a group. Non-metallic tendency increases going from left to right across the periodic table.

## List of Elements That Are Nonmetals - ThoughtCo
Metallic character isn't an all-or-nothing property. Carbon, for example, has allotropes that behave more like metals than nonmetals. Sometimes this element is considered to be a metalloid rather than a nonmetal. Hydrogen acts as an alkali metal under extreme pressure. Even oxygen has a metallic form as a solid.
