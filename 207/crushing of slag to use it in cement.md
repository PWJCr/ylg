## Properties and Uses of Steelmaking Slag - IspatGuru
The compressive strength of concrete using steelmaking slag as fine aggregates is around 1.1 to 1.3 times of common concrete. Further, steelmaking slag concrete shows similar fire resistance to the river aggregate mixture up to 400 deg C, and much improved fire resistance at high-temperature ranges.

It was found that some sl ag aggregates were light in.Several studies proved that the use of steel slag in concrete as aggregate improves its mechanical and durability properties (Sekaran ., 2015). Subramani and Ravi (2015), et al also reported that when steel slag is used in concrete, it acts as filler and as a strengthening material.

## Why use Fly Ash and Slag in Concrete? - Bay-Lynx Manufacturing Inc.
With cement being the costliest ingredient, substituting fly ash or slag can help maintain a stronger mix at a lower cost. Fly ash and Slag will typically be 18% cheaper than Portland cement. When a mix includes 20% fly ash, this will provide savings of 3.5% in cost. The advantage of slag is its ability to substitute more of cement.

History of cement. The origin of hydraulic cements goes back to ancient Greece and Rome.The materials used were lime and a volcanic ash that slowly reacted with it in the presence of water to form a hard mass. This formed the cementing material of the Roman mortars and concretes of more than 2,000 years ago and of subsequent construction work in western Europe.
