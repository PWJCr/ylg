## Single-line diagram
In power engineering, a single-line diagram (SLD), also sometimes called one-line diagram, is a simplest symbolic representation of an electric power system. A single line in the diagram typically corresponds to more than one physical conductor: in a direct current system the line includes the supply and return paths, in a three-phase system the line represents all three phases (the conductors

Overall plant single line diagrams show the electrical power distribution system, in simplified form, from the utility and/or generated supply to the load side of substation protection devices. Exceptions include substations 600 volts and over. The size of the power system determines the number of drawings required.Generally, the overall plant single line diagrams do not include breakdowns [.]

## How to read single one line diagram | Electric Arc - ArcAdvisor
Lets go through a industrial single line diagram. When interpreting a single line diagram, you should always start at the top where the highest voltage is and work your way down to the lowest voltage. This helps to keep the voltages and their paths straight. To explain this easier, we have divided the single line into three sections.
