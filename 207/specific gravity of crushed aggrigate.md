If it were crushed in the manner of a graded aggregate base material, the density would be upwards of 120+ pcf. RAP will be somewhere in the 90 to 95 pcf range, depending on gradation.  The dry rodded unit weight of coarse concrete aggregate will be in that range and slightly higher for normal specific gravity aggregate. Red Flag This Post

Crushed rock is an example of an angular aggregate. 4)Flaky Aggregates  Shape, size, and texture of coarse aggregate; Specific Gravity; Soundness; Water absorption; Durability; Strength; 2)Fine Aggregate. When the particles of an aggregate passed from sieve # 4 (4.75 mm) are known as fine aggregates. It includes sand, silt, and clay.

## specific gravity of crushed granite aggregate
Absolute Specific Gravity = (Weight of oven-dried aggregate at 100Â°c for 24 hours) / (Weight of water's volume equal to that of aggregate's solids excluding pores) Essential Points Most of the aggregates possess a relative density within 2.4 - 2.9 with a similar particle density about 2400 .

What Is Specific Gravity of Aggregate? Specific Gravity is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water. Water, at a temperature of 73.4Â°F (23Â°C) has a specific gravity of 1. Specific Gravity is important for several reasons. Some deleterious particles are lighter than the good aggregates.

## Measuring the Specific Gravity and Absorption of Steel Slag and Crushed 
This method is expected to better determine the specific gravity and absorption of these special aggregates. The steel slag and crushed concrete were tested at 30 minutes of vacuum saturation under 30mm Hg pressure. Statistical analysis indicated that this proposed method was viable in determining the specific gravities and absorption of these
