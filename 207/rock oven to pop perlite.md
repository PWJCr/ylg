## Should You Add Perlite to Your Soil? | Grow Weed Easy
It's recommended to add perlite so it makes up around 10-50% of the total volume of potting mix. Add 10-20% perlite if you want better water retention and don't plan on using a lot of extra nutrients. This is because a lot of extra perlite can cause the nutrients leach out faster from the soil as water drains through easily.

WHAT IS PERLITE? Perlite is made from volcanic rock, which is heated and crushed until it explodes in order to transform the rock into small white pieces. It has medium water retention ratings and low nutrient retention ratings. It is added to soil mixes in order to improve the drainage capability of both soil-based and soilless potting mixes.

## cob oven: perlite or sawdust for insulation? - Permies
It depends on how you are going to use it. If you are mixing sawdust with the clay (or cob) to make an insulating layer, that can work. If you are filling a void with just sawdust, it won't. The sawdust in the clay may burn out but the voids left are still insulating. Perlite won't burn and so is more flexible.
