##  Crushing Plant Design and Layout Considerations
As it turned out, designers are now adding secondary or pebble crushers to SAG circuits, on both greenfield and retrofit projects, to increase feed rate to the SAG mill. In other words, crushing plants, from primary to quaternary circuits, are here to stay. There are three main steps in designing a good crushing plant: process design, equipment

A very large number of secondary crushers in our present-day plants were originally primary crushers in those same plants. "Secondary" and "second-stage" are synonymous, and are equally good and descriptive definitions.  otherwise the quarry equipment may be held up at times, waiting on the secondary crushing stage to clear itself
