## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

4.1.2 Iron Ore Beneficiation Iron ore occurs naturally in a variety of forms, from sand-like iron fines to solid rock masses. Crude ore, or ore mined in the natural state, seldom occurs in a pure state and requires some form of beneficiation. Crude ore is commonly mixed with other minerals (gangue), which reduce the iron content.
