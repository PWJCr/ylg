The concrete material properties are given in Fig. 7.5(e) where the crushing strain of the concrete ɛ c = 0.003. The flexural analysis ( Section 3.4.2.1 and Fig. 3.36 ) is illustrated in Fig. 7.7 where the pivotal point in Fig. 7.7(b) is taken to be the strain in the RC beam at plate debonding (ɛ pivot ) RC = 0.00267+0.00067 = 0.00334.
