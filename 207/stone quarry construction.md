## From The Quarry To The Kitchen: How Natural Stone Is Quarried
The diamond-wire saw, as the name indicates, is a type of saw used in quarrying. The wire saw uses synthetic diamonds as the abrasion to cut through the stone. The saw basically consists of two parts: an engine and a steel wire laced with diamond-impregnated beads. This wire is fed through previously drilled channels.
