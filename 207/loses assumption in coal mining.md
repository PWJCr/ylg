## Planning Process | Introduction | underground COAL
The start of the planning process is the elimination of any parts of the lease which cannot be worked at all or cannot be readily mined for whatever reason. This, together with some knowledge of coal quality will allow an estimate of the value of the resource, depending on the assumptions made regarding operating costs, the percentage of coal

## Role of coal deformation energy in coal and gas outburst: A review
The AE energy of intact coal increases sharply at the stress peak, reflecting that a large amount of deformation energy is transmitted outward in the form of elastic waves after the intact coal loses its bearing capacity. The AE ringing count and accumulated energy of tectonic coal are several orders of magnitude smaller than those of intact coal.

Coal is abundant and inexpensive. Assuming that current rates of usage and production do not change, estimates of reserves indicate that enough coal remains to last more than 200 years. There are, however, a variety of problems associated with the use of coal. Mining operations are hazardous. Each year hundreds of coal miners lose their lives or are seriously injured.
