## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining - Earthworks
Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide, modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.

Leaching, often gold, is the process of extracting a soluble constituent from a solid by means of a solvent. In extractive metallurgy, of gold, it is the process of dissolving a certain mineral (or minerals) from an ore or a concentrate, or dissolving certain constituents from materials such as a calcines, mattes, scrap alloys, anodic slimes, etc., to achieve either one or two purposes:

## Gold Extraction / Mining | Goldfo
Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process. The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity. With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand. Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust. Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.

Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
