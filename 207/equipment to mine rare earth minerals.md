Mine in Space to Build in Space. Bringing rare metals to Earth is not the only possible use for asteroid-derived materials. Building equipment on Earth then lifting it into space is, in fact, expensive. Every ounce of material costs money to lift into orbit, and individual space launches cost upwards of $100 million.

About 35% of the world's reserves of rare-earth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

## Mining the consequences of the rare earths industry | Greenbiz
In the 1990s, a number of successful Chinese mining operations began, with their rich supply of high-quality rare earths flooding the global market and driving prices down to near-record lows. The same phenomenon that lured the United States into the rare earths business — rapid price fluctuation — ushered their exit as well.
