1. Single magnetic separation process. Single magnetite is mainly sedimentary metamorphic magnetite, and most of the iron minerals in the ore are magnetite. This type of magnetite is a strongly magnetic mineral with simple ore composition, and high-grade, high-recovery iron concentrate can be obtained by the weak magnetic separation method.

## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

The high content product of obtained materials is iron ore concentrate, and the rest one is flotation tailings. This magnetite beneficiation process is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated when it is magnetite than a comparable grade of hematite ore, especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.
