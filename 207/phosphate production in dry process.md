## phosphate production in dry process
phosphate production in dry process. The wet process involves treating the rock phosphate with acid-producing phosphoric acid - also called green or black acid - and gypsum, which is removed as a by-product. The impurities that give the acid its color haven't been a problem in the production of dry fertilizers.

## Urine
Urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in humans and in many other animals. Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the urinary bladder. Urination results in urine being excreted from the body through the urethra.. Cellular metabolism generates many by-products that are rich in nitrogen and must be cleared from the bloodstream, such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine.
