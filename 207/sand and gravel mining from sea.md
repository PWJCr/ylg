## 6 things you need to know about sand mining
Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

Sand Mining In Sea.  Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel USGS 2013b. Thus the worlds use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for

## Sand
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size. Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.. The composition of sand varies, depending on the

## Sand and Gravel | Indiana Geological & Water Survey
Figure 1. Sand, gravel, and specialty sand are major raw materials mined in Indiana. Weathering of rocks forms pieces of rock of various sizes and shapes as seen in Figure 1. Gravel consists of unconsolidated deposits made of pieces of rock greater than two mm in size and is almost always accompanied by sand deposits made of smaller pieces of sand.

Aromolaran (2012) studied the effects of sand mining activities of rural people on agricultural land in Agraian communities of Ogun state in Nigeria. His work revealed that mining of sand and gravel on agricultural land is one of the alternative livelihood activities of the rural people in Nigeria and is now becoming an environmental issue.

Sep 20, 2021Relation to Mining. Uses. Sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams, are mostly quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO2) grains. Weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains. In the process of weathering, the softer, weaker minerals in granite (such as feldspar) are weathered away.

## Illegal Sand Mining | VAIGAI NATHI
Sand mining is a practice that is used to extract sand, mainly through an open pit. However, sand is also mined from beaches, inland dunes and dredged from oceanbeds and river beds.  Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and also impacts the local wildlife. Excessive instream sand-and-gravel mining causes the degradation of rivers.
