## Psychrotrophic Bacteria in Pasteurized Milk â What you  - QualiTru
Psychrotrophic contamination is the primary reason for the premature spoilage of pasteurized milk. However, these bacteria grow at refrigeration temperatures, and depending on the species, may also survive pasteurization. The growth rate of the contaminants is the primary factor affecting quality when psychrotrophic bacteria determine shelf-life.

Pasteurization is intended to make milk and milk products safe by destroying all the vegetative pathogenic organisms. Pasteurization systems are designed to provide a 5 log reduction of the microbial load using the most thermotolerant target pathogen Coxiella burnetii.With pasteurization, not only are pathogenic microorganisms killed but also a wide range of spoilage organisms are destroyed.

Pasteurization is intended to make milk and milk products safe by destroying all the vegetative pathogenic organisms. The spoilage microflora of pasteurized milk is of two types: postpasteurization contaminants, which have entered the milk after heating; and heat-resistant bacteria, which have survived heating.

It is suggested that shelf life is influenced only to a minor extent by raw-milk-associated factors, and improved plant sanitation and disinfection that target the elimination of spores are necessary. Premature spoilage and varying product quality due to microbial contamination still constitute major problems in the production of microfiltered and pasteurized extended shelf life (ESL) milk.

They also investigated how pasteurization affects the presence of such bacteria. Concerns about food safety have prompted many dairy processors to increase pasteurization temperatures above the 161 F minimum set by the government. Anecdotal reports, however, suggested this practice actually led to more spoilage once the products were refrigerated.

## Classification of the spoilage flora of raw and pasteurized bovine milk 
Minor groups in raw milk included Enterobacteriaceae spp. and Acinetobacter spp. Pasteurized milk was spoilt by essentially the same Gram-negative organisms in 65% (5 degrees C) and 50% (7 degrees C) of the cases. The phenotypic characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria are given.

## Pasteurization
Pasteurization or pasteurisation is a process in which packaged and non-packaged foods (such as milk and fruit juices) are treated with mild heat, usually to less than 100 Â°C (212 Â°F), to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life.The process is intended to destroy or deactivate organisms and enzymes that contribute to spoilage or risk of disease, including vegetative bacteria, but most

## Microbial Contamination in Milk Quality and Health Risk of the 
The spores of thermoduric microorganisms can be found in processed products, such as pasteurized milk and stored cream, decreasing their shelf life [91, 126]. To ensure the shelf life of the pasteurized milk, it is necessary to comply with a maximum spore limit of B. cereus of 3 log spores/mL .
