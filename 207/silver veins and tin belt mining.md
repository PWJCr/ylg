Abstract: Intense Sn-As-Zn-Ag vein mineralization was found at the 26th Level of the Besshi mine, of which deposit is a conformable massive sulfidetype (Besshi-type).The mineralization resulted in formation of such rare Sn minerals as rhodostannite, hocartite and a franckeite-like mineral, as well as common stannite and cassiterite.

## The Best Locations in World of Warcraft to Mine Tin Ore
The tin ore is commonly found on its border with Stranglethorn Vale, but regenerates fast, allowing WoW miners to mine the area several times every two to three hours. Advantages: You don't need to farm the entire region-the southern mountains will provide enough tin ore to mine. Stacks: Alliance players can farm two to three stacks in one run.

Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

## Golden Belt Mine - Western Mining History
The Golden Belt vein, which strikes approximately N. 60° E. and dips from 10° to 23° S.E., occurs within the fissure zone of a probable thrust fault. Minton(67) states that the vein, as exposed, ranges from a few inches to about 3 feet in width and carries from $5 to $40 in gold and from one to 10 ounces of silver per ton.

## Silver mining
Silver mining has been undertaken since as early as the 5th century BCE. As silver is a precious metal often used for coins and bullion, its mining has historically often been lucrative. As with other precious metals such as gold or platinum, newly discovered deposits of silver ore have sparked silver rushes of miners seeking their fortunes. In recent centuries, large deposits were discovered

## Vein (geology)
In geology, a vein is a distinct sheetlike body of crystallized minerals within a rock.Veins form when mineral constituents carried by an aqueous solution within the rock mass are deposited through precipitation.The hydraulic flow involved is usually due to hydrothermal circulation.. Veins are classically thought of as being the ones in the body not the rock veins and arteries planar fractures
