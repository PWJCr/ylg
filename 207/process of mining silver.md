The fine-grained silver minerals are distributed in galena, sphalerite and copper sulfide minerals in the form of contiguous bodies, inclusions, and micro bodies. In the flotation process, those sulfide minerals that are closely related to silver minerals will become their carriers, enriching silver into various concentrate products.

## What is Process Mining - RPA and Process Mining | UiPath
Process mining is a technique to analyze and track processes. In traditional business process management, it is done with process workshops and interviews, which results in an idealized picture of a process. Process mining, however, uses existing data available in corporate information systems and automatically displays the real process.
