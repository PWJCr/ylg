## Ministry of Coal, GOI
In India, power is generated from conventional (Thermal, Nuclear & Hydro) and renewable sources (Wind, Solar, Biomass etc.). However, Major production of Electricity is achieved through coal a thermal power plant which is around 75% of the total power generation. India's total power generation in Dec 2020 stood at 103.66 billion units
