## Aggregate Supply - Indian Economy Notes - Prepp
Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given period at a given overall price. The aggregate supply curve (AS) describes the relationship between price levels and the quantity of output that firms are willing to provide. Generally, aggregate supply and the price level have a positive relationship.

The aggregate supply curve (AS) is horizontal at GDP levels less than potential, and vertical once Yp is reached. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices; any increase in AD affects only prices, not output. Figure 1. The Pure Keynesian AD-AS Model.

The long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is vertical because the price level has no bearing on the economy's long-run potential. The LRAS curve intersects the horizontal axis where the factors of production are used in the most efficient manner, which is called the full employment output or the natural level of output.

The Aggregate Demand Curve. Aggregate demand, or AD, refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We'll talk about that more in other articles, but for now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.

## Learn About Aggregate Supply Curve | Chegg
An individual supply curve reflects the supply of a commodity by a single supplier. An aggregate supply curve represents the total supply of all suppliers in the economy at various price levels. It is the sum of individual supply curves. Every economy generates two types of supply curves: short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS) and long-run

THE SHORT-RUN AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE. In the short run, a fall in the price level from P1 to P2 reduces the quantity of output supplied from Y1 to Y2. This positive relationship could be due to misperceptions, sticky wages, or sticky prices. Over time, perceptions, wages, and prices adjust, so this positive relationship is only temporary.
