## Carl Frederich Mohs Scale of Hardness for Rocks and Minerals
Absolute Hardness: 2. 3 = Calcite. Calcite is an anhydrous carbonate, and one of the most widely distributed minerals on the Earth's surface. It is a common constituent of sedimentary rocks. In crystallized form, Calcite has a vitreous lustre. Absolute Hardness: 9. 4 = Fluorite. Fluorite is a mineral composed of calcium fluoride.

## Mineral Hardness Test Kits and Hardness Picks - Geology
Only $112.99. Hardness picks make hardness testing a more precise process - especially when testing small specimens or mineral grains within a rock. The point of the pick can easily be placed on the part of the specimen that you want to test. The scratches that you make or trails of metal that are left behind are usually very easy to distinguish.

## Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness - ThoughtCo
The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is an ordinal scale that tests the hardness of minerals based on their ability to scratch softer materials. The Mohs scale runs from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest). Talc has a Mohs hardness of 1, while diamond has a hardness of 10. The Mohs scale is only one hardness scale. It is useful in mineral identification

The term hardness was originally applied to waters that were hard to wash in, referring to the soap wasting properties of hard water. Hardness prevents soap from lathering by causing the development of an insoluble curdy precipitate in the water; hardness typically causes the buildup of hardness scale (such as seen in cooking pans).

The Rockwell brothers were metallurgists working in a Connecticut ball bearing factory back in the early 1900s. They recognized the need for accurately and quickly testing metal strength in bearing races.
