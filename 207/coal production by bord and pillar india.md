Spontaneous combustion (SC) is a cold oxidation reaction that generates heat, causing a temperature rise of the reactant and leading, with limited heat dissipation, to self-ignition of the reactant, which occurs without an external heat source.

## How To Separate Coal From Rock - Realonomics
Jan 20, 2022Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. . If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground it can be extracted through surface mining. In surface mining workers simply remove any overlying sediment vegetation and rock called overburden.

At present, production by longwall mining accounts for a minor amount of total underground mining production with the majority coming from bord-and-pillar methods. Since it is envisaged that longwall mining will require time to become established in India, bord-and-pillar methods will continue to be dominant in the foreseeable future.

## bord and pillar mining india
Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production. In deep mining, the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof.
