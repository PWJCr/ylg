## What is the mixing ratio in asphalt concrete? - Answers
Asphalt concrete mixes should require a maximum dust asphalt ratio of 1.2 and a minimum of 0.6. (9) A tool which is very useful in evaluating aggregate gradations is the 0.45 power gradation chart

## Concrete Mix Ratio: What Is It? What Is 1-2-3? .And More.
Nov 8, 2021A concrete mix ratio is usually expressed by a set of numbers separated by colons, as is the case with a 1:2:3 ratio. This tells the mixer that they need to add 1 part cement powder, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate in order to create the desired concrete consistency. Water is not included in these ratios, though, because it can vary more

## What are the Correct Concrete Mixing Ratios - Ratio Chart
When making your own concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong, durable concrete mix. Some basic mixing ratios for concrete are 1:2:3, 1:3:3, 1:2:4. These mixing ratios are based on the proportions of cement : sand : stone in that order. The ratio you use will depend on what psi strength you need.

Mix ratio of 1:1.5:3 (cement: aggregate: sand+ quarry dust) give the optimum strength in this study. (refer Table 6,7) 2. As the percentage of Quarry Dust gradually increases, the Compressive strength of concrete will also increase with condition that percentage of Quarry Dust should not exceed 50%. 3. The compressive strength of compressed
