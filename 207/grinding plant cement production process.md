3. Grinding: The clinkers as obtained from the rotary kiln are finely ground in ball mills and tube mills. During grinding, a small quantity, about 3 to 4 per cent, of gypsum is added. The gypsum controls the initial setting time of cement. If gypsum is not added, the cement would set as soon as water is added.
