## How To Calculate Cement, Sand And Aggregate In Concrete
Specific gravities of concrete materials are as follows: Cement = 3.15. Sand = 2.6. Coarse aggregates = 2.6. The percentage of entrained air assumed is 2%. The mix proportion of 1:1.5:3 by dry volume of materials can be expressed in terms of masses as: Cement = 1 x 1500 = 1500. Sand = 1.5 x 1700 = 2550. Coarse aggregate = 3 x 1650 = 4950.

## Volume Batching of Concrete - Theory & Example Calculation
Batching of concrete means measuring different ingredients of concrete (i.e. cement, sand, coarse aggregate and water) before mixing it. When this measurement is done on the basis of volume, we call it Volume Batching. Below are mentioned some of important points to remember before adopting volume batching method in field.

mix ratio for m25 concrete = 1:1:2. We have to do following calculating steps:- Step 1 :-we have wet volume of concrete is equal to 1 cubic metre (1m3), but when we calculate actual quantity of dry ingredient cement, sand and aggregate of concrete we have to calculate dry volume of concrete. For converting wet volume to dry volume of concrete we will multiply 1.54 in wet volume of concrete

## Pouring concrete over clay soilcalia
Yes, you can pour concrete over dirt. If you have a very compact soil -type, such as solid clay, then you may have ground that is solid enough to support a slab over a period of time. One of the big risks for pouring directly onto the earth is water pooling beneath the slab and traveling up into the slab.

Cement = 1440 kg/cum ; Fine Aggregate = 1600 kg/cum ; Coarse Aggregate = 1450 kg/cum ; Water = 1000 kg/cum. The dry loose density varies for. Considering a concrete mix proportion (by volume) of 1:2:4. i.e., Cement: Fine aggregate (Sand) : Coarse Aggregate is in the ratio of 1:2:4 by volume. Cement required = 01 bag = 50 kg ~ 36 liters or 0.036 cum

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate for Concrete?
Volume of Coarse Aggregate = 3/5.5 x 1.55. So the required Cement Volume - 0.282 m 3 or 8.14 Bags Sand Volume - 0.423 m 3. Coarse Aggregate - 0.845 m 3. Water Cement Ratio Calculation. From the IS Code standard, Assuming the water-cement ratio for M20 is 0.55. Therefore required water quantity = Cement Volume X WC Ratio = 0.282 X 0.55 = 0

## How to calculate cement sand and aggregate quantity in concrete?
Calculating the aggregate quantity, Get the part of aggregate content in the concrete mix from the grade specified in fraction from. (Example, part of cement in grade M15 is 4/7 as ratio is 1:2:4). Multiply the same with the required dry volume of the concrete you will get the aggregate required in volume which has to be converted to weight.
