## Crushed Gravel, Stone and Rock Sizes - Chart and Grades
Apr 22, 2022Nowadays, 'gravel' is also often used to describe all types of manufactured crushed stone and rocks used as aggregate in the construction industry as well as naturally occurring stones. Aggregate is made by harvesting large rocks and then crushing them using mechanical crushers which can produce various crushed stone grades of different sizes.
