## sinter furnace used in pelletizing process
Home / sinter furnace used in pelletizing process  IspatGuru,9/3/2013 Today sinter is the main metallic burden for a large blast furnace. The sintering process is used to agglomerate a mix of iron ores (blend), return ﬁnes, ﬂuxes and coke, with a particle size of less than 10 mm, so that the resulting sinter, with a screened size of 10

## Sinter plant
Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature, to create a product that can be used in a blast furnace.The final product, a sinter, is a small, irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals. The process, called sintering, causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the chemical

What is the difference between pellets and sinter? The typical iron (Fe) content of sinter is around 55-58%, while BF pellets are normally 62-66% Fe. BF pellets have a higher Fe content as they are manufactured from low- grade ores that are finely ground prior to undergoing mineral beneficiation treatments.

## sintering of iron ore reactions
During the sintering of mini-pellets, goethite, which has relatively high reducibility, should be retained as residual ore in the sinter cake The strength of the sinter cake was kept by the bonding reaction of the mini-pellets, which have a low melting temperature This is the main principle of the reaction-controlled sintering method

## Investigation on mercury flow and emission in integrated primary iron 
4 days agoBlast furnace. In the BF process, molten iron or hot metal is produced as a product of reaction between raw materials and coke. At high-temperature iron ore, sinter, pellet and coke are charged from the top and hot gas from the bottom helps it to reduce to metallic iron. Coke plays the major role in the reduction process.
