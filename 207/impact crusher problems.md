## Understanding comminution: Compression versus impact crushing
If impact crushing is opening a walnut with a hammer, compression crushing is the nutcracker. A steady compression force applied by closing the product between the mantle (or jaw) dies and the crushing chamber's wall. Compression crushers such as cones and jaw crushers normally have lower reduction ratios than impact crushers like a

## impact crusher crusher
The primary impact crushers are used to process from 200 t/h up to 1900 t/h and feed sizes of up to 1830 mm (71") in the largest model. Primary impact crushers are generally used in nonabrasive applications and where the production of fines is not a problem. Of all primary crushers, the impactor is the crusher that gives the best cubical product.
