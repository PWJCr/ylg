## CONCRETE MIX DESIGN USING CRUSHED SAND - The Constructor
The common method of expressing the proportions of ingredients of a concrete mix is in the terms of parts or ratios of cement, fine and coarse aggregates. For e.g., a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement, fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement, two parts of fine aggregate and four

What is Crusher Run? TriStar Concrete. Crusher run is a blended mix of coarse aggregate and fine aggregate. The combination of both crushed stone and stone dust creates a low void content (the amount of space or air between the pieces of rock in a mix) that is valuable in concrete construction for its compaction ability and drainage characteristics.
