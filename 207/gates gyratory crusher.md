Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher . The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.

Gyratory Crushers. Invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates in 1881; Gates Crusher. A conical element is supported in a flared shell or frame creating a chamber wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. The center element is caused to gyrate about its fulcrum point causing it to advance and retreat with relation to the shell.

The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive. بیشتر

## Types of Crushers: What You Need to Know - Machinery Partner
The Gates' gyratory crushers were preferred by the mining industry for almost two decades until the turn of the century, circa 1910, when Blake's jaw crushers saw a resurgence in popularity. The demand for large-mouthed jaw crushers skyrocketed as the industry began to understand their potential as primary crushers in rock quarries.

## Crushers: Breaking Down the History of these Machines
Blake's crusher was announced in 1857 and patented in 1858. Perhaps surprisingly, the same basic design is still in use today for rock crushers. In the years following the design of the Blake Jaw Crusher, another type of crusher was designed. A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881.

The gyratory crusher is taller than the jaw crusher, thus needs a high workshop design. Besides, gyratory crusher is heavy than jaw crusher, it's not convenient to move. Capacity. Gyratory crusher can work continuously, has high productivity and crushing ratio ( up to 6-9.5), working performance is very stable, light vibration.

A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher, consisting of a concave surface and a conical head with both the surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel liners. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but it does not rotate. The movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement.
