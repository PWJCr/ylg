The fineness test for cement formula is (W2/W1)×100. Fineness test for cement formula = (W2/W1)×100, where, W2 = Cement residue on a sieve, W1 = Weight of given sample of cement. Now users have to calculate the percentage of Weight of cement-retained on Sieve. Test Result 1 for sample: Let W1 = 100g, W2= 4.68,

Answer (1 of 2): Fineness of cement is the direct indication of its particle size. Generally, it is measured on a scale of 1-10. Lower the fineness of the cement / aggregate finer is the particle size. And finer the particle size, greater will be the surface area available for hydration of cemen

## Why fineness test of cement is done? Explained by FAQ Blog
What are the physical test on cement? The fineness of cement can be determined by Sieve Test or Air Permeability test. Sieve Test: Air-set lumps are broken, and the cement is sieved continuously in a circular and vertical motion for a period of 15 minutes. The residue left on the sieve is weighed, and it should not exceed 10% for ordinary cement.

## Various Tests on Cement - Expert Civil
The purpose of this test is to determine the percentage of water required for preparing cement pastes for other tests. Take 300 gm of cement and add 30 per cent by weight or 90 gm of water to it. Mix water and cement thoroughly. Fill the mould of the Vicat apparatus and the gauging time should be 3.75 to 4.25 minutes.

## Fineness of Cement by Blaines Air Permeability Method (Is-4031-part-2)
In the early 1900s, cement fineness was expressed as the mass of cement per fractional size (percent weight retained on specific sieve sizes). Now a day's fineness is usually measured by the Blaine air-permeability test that indirectly measures the surface area of the cement particles per unit mass.
