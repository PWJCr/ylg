GRINDING MACHINE. 3. Introduction • A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is any of various power tools or machine tools used for grinding, which is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the work piece via shear deformation.

A bench grinder is a type of grinding machine that is used to drive abrasive wheels. The difference between other grinding machines (die grinder or angle grinder) and bench grinder is that it is mounted on a bench or a table. These tools are used to sharpen cutting tools like chisels, drill bits, tool bits, and many more.

## General Safety Guidelines while Working on Grinding Machines
5. Always use the face of the grinding wheel that is meant for grinding. 6. One should slowly move job-pieces across the face of wheel in a uniform manner. This will keep the wheel sound. 7. Grinding wheels should be checked properly timely for soundness. Suspend the wheel on a string and tap it. If the wheel rings, it is probably sound.
