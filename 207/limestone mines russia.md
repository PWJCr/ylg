## Mines: Site Closure, Reclamation, and Conversion - Geosyntec
Mining Site Closure, Reclamation, and Conversion. Geosyntec recognizes that the conversion of closed or abandoned mine sites into productive economic assets or safe, open space is one of the most challenging aspects of life-cycle mine management. This is accomplished through the execution of a mine site reclamation and closure planning process
