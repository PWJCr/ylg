## What Is The Purpose Of Coning And Quartering Technique In Sample 
Jun 1, 2022The purpose of coning and quartering is to reduce the amount of noise that is generated during the sample processing process. This is done by coning the sample in such a way that the center of the sample is located in the center of the conical prism. This will minimize the noise generated from the sample movement and also the sample itself.
