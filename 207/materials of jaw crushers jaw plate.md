## What Are Jaw Crushers and How Do They Work? | Oreflow
In single-toggle jaw crushers, the moving crusher operates in an elliptical pattern while in double-toggle jaw crushers, a pendulum motion is utilized in order to crush hard materials. The crushing force is generated by the eccentric shaft which is then transferred to the crushing zone by a toggle plate system.

## Jaw Plate Failure and Life - Crushing, Screening & Conveying 
Too many fines can accelerate jaw plate wear. What happens is the fines will fill the jaw plate corrugations or valleys. These valleys are necessary for the crusher to crush efficiently. Filling the valleys with fines creates an event called compaction. Normally a jaw crusher will squeeze the material between the stationary and moving jaw plates.
