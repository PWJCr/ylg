Flotation responses of quartz and feldspar in 20 mg/l diamine solution (PDP) and as a function of various depressants (concentration: 5.10-4M). It can be seen in Figure 2 that it is evident the difference in floatability of minerals in the flotation cell in presence of EDTA and the best quartz feldspar separation are obtained at pH of around 2.

## What is feldspars and quartz? Explained by FAQ Blog
May 30, 2022Separating quartz from feldspar is difficult due to similar densities and magnetic susceptibilities. A useful separation method for both minerals is froth flotation [12,13], which combines physical and chemical treatments, and is known as an effective method in the mining industry for the beneficiation of feldspar.

With feldspar and quartz, there is plenty of overlap between colors. Since they are both highly abundant crystals, there are plenty of variations. In many cases, though not always, feldspar is cloudy in appearance, while quartz is clear. If you held up a piece of quartz to a light source, the light would shine through.
