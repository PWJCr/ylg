## Crushers - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.

Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.
