## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

## Magnetism
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism.

## Iron Ore Market Size, Trends & Price Forecast | Growth, 
A huge amount of ore extraction and extraction of fossil fuels, metals, and minerals cause harm to the environment and result in natural disasters. Additionally, the ores are extracted underground, consuming more energy due to the increased depth. More energy is required to balance the temperature underground, limiting the iron ore market growth.

Electrolysis of iron ore has not been developed in the past because of the energetic balance and energy expenses. In addition, until now, its application in iron production has been hindered due to the difficulty in finding a suitable anode material capable of weathering the challenging conditions.

Feb 11, 2021We think iron ore may show fresh signs of weakness, which suggests AUD's balance of risks may be tilted to the downside in the short-term. In the longer-run, we expect the global reflation narrative and AUD's undervaluation to be the prevailing factors and we see AUD/USD move above 0.80 even if iron ore prices decline.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
