How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? Bright Hub Engineering. Thermal based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources.The coal fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption.Coal fired power plants,while producing power,require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.

## How to Calculate the Coal Quantity Used in a Power Plant
Coal trader's web sites give base prices in the international market. We take a coal price of around 65 $ / Ton. The cost of coal consumed by 100 MW power plant is (53.8 x 65) 3497 $ /hr. A 100 MW unit produces 100,000 units of electricity. So the cost of coal per unit of electricity is (3497/100,000) 3.5 cents per unit.

Surface mining, or strip mining, destroys natural habitats, and one type of surface mining, known as mountaintop removal mining, dramatically and irreparably alters the topography of the area. Surface areas exposed during mining, as well as coal and rock waste (which were often dumped indiscriminately), weather

Thus, by using this method of energy audit of coal handling plant we can find out the actual losses, method to rectify them and actual cost of the coal lost. In form of dust = 5 Kg = 5x 3.21. = 16.05 /-. Theft loss in wagon = Amount of coal feed in wagon = 100 ton. Amount of coal lest at last when it reaches the power plant = 70 ton.

## Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant - an overview - ScienceDirect
1.1 Overview. Nearly 50% of the electricity generated in the world uses coal as the primary fuel. The function of the coal-fired thermal power plant is to convert the energy available in the coal to electricity. Coal power plants work by using several steps to convert stored energy in coal to usable electricity.
