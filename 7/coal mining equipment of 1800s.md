## From Shovels to Machines - West Virginia
In southern West Virginia, however, surface and underground mining produce nearly equal amounts of coal. As a result of new equipment, companies now excavate more coal with far fewer miners. Today, West Virginia produces as much coal as ever but employs less than 18,000 miners, down from a high of 125,000 in 1948. The Railroads Today

## History of coal mining
The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years, with early mines documented in ancient China, the Roman Empire and other early historical economies. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today

## Coal mining - Conservapedia
Coal mining is the process of digging coal out of the ground and bringing it to market.  Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment. Before 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as support pillars. As a result, in the deep Tyneside pits (300 to 1,000 ft. deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be
