While cone crushers are usually supported at the base, gyratory crushers are suspended. Impact crushers, sometimes called "hammer crushers," use mass and velocity to break up pieces with a blow bar or hammer that strikes a stationary plate. When the rock hits the plate or anvil, it breaks on natural stress lines to create a uniform product.
