## What are the advantages of an ash handling system in a thermal power plant?
Answer (1 of 5): Well, it depends on what fuel is used. A gaseous fuel, such as natural gas (methane) has no ash, therefore no ash handling system is needed at all. Many liquid fuels, particularly highly distilled ones like diesel fuel, jet fuel or gasoline have virtually no ash as well. Heavier

## [Solved] A pulverized coal boiler generates approximately _______ fly
In the coal thermal power plant, the steam is produced at high pressure in the steam boiler due to the burning of fuel (pulverized coal) in boiler furnaces. The pulverized coal boiler produces approximately 80% fly ash and 20% bottom ash. Additional Information Coal ash: A collection of residuals produced during the combustion of coal.

## Rice husk for plantssail
These rice husk power plants are 'mini power- plants' with the installed capacity of 35-100 kW. The HPS initiative saves 42,000 litres of kerosene and 18,000 litres of diesel per year. About 300 kg of rice husk is used as a raw material to generate around 40 kilowatt of energy, which is sufficient to supply energy to 500 households for 6-12.
