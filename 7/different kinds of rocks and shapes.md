Rock is a naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals. It is categorized by the minerals & chemical composition and the way in which it is formed. Rocks can be hard or soft, and they come in a variety of colours. The most prevalent minerals found in all types of rocks are feldspar and quartz.

Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and crystallization of magma. Magma is generated in the plastic asthenosphere, a layer of molten rock under the Earth's crust. There are two types of igneous rock, intrusive and extrusive. Intrusive igneous rock is crystallized below Earth's surface, and the slow cooling causes large crystals to form.
