## How Gold Is Mined | Gold Mining Process | World Gold Council
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as dor√© - typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## Mining and milling - ScienceDirect
Milling follows the mining process, which is intended to extract the uranium from the ore. Milling is largely a chemical process, which yields a product much higher in uranium content than mining, but not yet pure enough for the fabrication of nuclear fuel. Several chemical processes used in milling were summarized.

Cutting speed of a milling cutter is its peripheral linear speed resulting from operation. It is expressed in meters per minute. The cutting speed can be derived from the above formula. V = œÄDN /1000 where, d = Diameter of milling cutter in mm, V = Cutting speed (linear) in meter per minute, and n = Cutter speed in revolution per minute.

## Gold extraction - QueensMineDesignWiki
Free-milling gold ores are defined as an ore from which standard cyanidation (which takes about 20-30 hours) can extract more than 90 % of the gold, under the condition that the ore size is 80 % < 75 ¬µm (Joe Zhou, 2004). Complex ores, meanwhile, require significantly higher cyanide or oxygen levels to attain an economic recovery (Brooy, 1994).

The second roller can be adjusted; depending on how fine or thick the distillery wants their grains. The grist is judged on three components, the husk, the grit or middle and the flour.
