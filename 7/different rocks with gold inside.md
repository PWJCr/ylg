## How to Identify Your Rocks: Full Guide With Helpful Tools
Run your fingers over the surface of the rock and see what you feel. Some rocks have textures that are unique enough that they can aid in identification. Most rocks will simply feel coarse or rough, but if you feel something different be sure to make a note of it. Some rocks may feel glassy, slippery, greasy, or gritty.

## Rock Types - Sandatlas
Rock type is usually defined as a particular kind of rock having a specific set of characteristics 1. Rock types are specific assemblages of minerals (most rocks are composed of minerals). Rocks are much more vaguely defined than minerals. Even rocks within one rock type may have a highly variable composition.

Rhyolite. Rhyolite is a felsic (silica-rich) volcanic igneous rock with the same mineral content as granite, only unlike granite, it cools fast from the molten rock near or over the surface of Earth's crust (extrusive type).When these magmas erupt, a rock with two grain sizes typically forms. The larger crystals that form just beneath the surface cool at a slower pace and are known as phenocrysts.

An example of this is the Shuangwang gold deposit (Fan, S.C. and Jin, Q.H., 1994), which is a large Carlin-type gold deposit in the Qinling area, hosted by stratabound breccia bodies (fig. 29),

Typically geodes do not have gold or diamonds in them. . Geodes are known to contain gems called Herkimer diamonds Bristol Diamonds as well as Gold aura quartz but they are not real gold or diamonds. Although certain quartz rock deposits have gold it is different from the quartz crystals commonly found inside geodes.

Gold ore is probably one of the most commonly misidentified minerals of all. I probably get at least 2 emails every week from someone asking if they have found gold, but 99.9% of the time, the gold rock that they have found is not actually gold. An important thing to understand about most gold ore is that it isn't shiny at all.
