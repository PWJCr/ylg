Many bauxite reserves in India have Al2O3/SiO2 ratio of 4 to 6 and hence pose difficulties in production of alumina through the Bayer process. The extraction of alumina from bauxite in low temperature digestion circuit frequently involves a desilication step in which kaolinite dissolves and reprecipitates as sodalite, a caustic insoluble sodium alumino silicate.
