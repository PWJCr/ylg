These mechanisms can be divided into three broad categories. The first is direct impacts and spillovers of mining on the local economy. Direct impacts on socioeconomic outcomes happen to a large extent through the labor market, as a consequence of both direct hiring and increased local economic activity.

The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine employees and often vegetation farms are abolished.
