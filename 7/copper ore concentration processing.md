4. Beneficiation of Copper Ore. The next step in processing is called beneficiation. This is the first step in concentrating the copper into a more useable form. 5. Smelting and Extraction. The next step in the process flow is smelting for sulfide ore concentrate and solvent extraction for oxide ore leach solution. 6.

copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.
