## Gossan
Gossan (eiserner hut or eisenhut) is intensely oxidized, weathered or decomposed rock, usually the upper and exposed part of an ore deposit or mineral vein.In the classic gossan or iron cap all that remains is iron oxides and quartz, often in the form of boxworks (which are quartz-lined cavities retaining the shape of the dissolved ore minerals). In other cases, quartz and iron oxides

## Gossan - Mining Fundamentals
Apr 29 2014. Gossan refers to the rust-colored capping or staining of a mineral deposit, which is mostly formed due to the oxidation or alteration of iron sulfides. Gossan generally appears as a red stain against the background rock and soil, due to the presence of a large quantity of oxidized iron. It gets its name from a Cornish miner's slang

Gold in Gossan. March 2003 by Edgar B. Heylmun, PhD. Gossan is defined as being an iron-bearing capping over a sulfide deposit. It is formed by the oxidation and leaching of sulfide minerals, leaving hydrated iron oxides such as limonite and goethite, along with manganese oxides. Online access required.
