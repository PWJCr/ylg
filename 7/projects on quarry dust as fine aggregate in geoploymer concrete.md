## quarry dust in geopolymer concrete
 Date: 5/1/2017. Abstract: To address the environmental constraints due to cement production and sand scarcity, strength properties of high-calcium fly ash (CFA)-based geopolymer concrete with quarry dust as fine aggregate is explored in this paper. River sand was replaced with quarry dust from 0 to 100% by mass. get price

Controlled Low Strength Material is defined by ACI Committee 229 as self-compacted, cementitious material used primarily as backfill in lieu of compacted fill. Several terms are used to describe CLSM such as flowable fill, unshrinkable fill, controlled density fill, flowable mortar, plastic soil cement and soil-cement slurry [3]. In general, the compressive strength of CLSM is 8.3 MPa or less.

This paper will review suitability of geopolymer as well cement under downhole conditions, and analyse the advantages of using geopolymer over OPC-based well cement. Moreover, well cement will be exposed to range of temperatures, pressures and fluid medium from the ground surface to sequestration depths of more than 1 km.

3.1 General Effect of Quarry Dust and Silica Fume: 5 The basic M20 concrete has given the design strength of 26.96 MPa at 28 days and with 20% Quarry dust the strength has gone up-to 28.59 MPa, 30% Quarry dust the strength has gone up-to30.52 MPa with work and 40% Quarry dust the strength has gone up-to 24.59 MPa. With 10% silica fume. get price

## Introduction to Quarry-Dust as Partial Replacement Material to  - IJERT
Cement can be replaced partially by quarry dust in percentage by weight like 10%,15%,20%,25%,30%,35%,40% and 50%. Experimental Study has shown the effect on Compressive strength of concrete by replacing cement with 10%,20% and 30% of quarry dust by S. Nazma and S. Madhavi [1].
