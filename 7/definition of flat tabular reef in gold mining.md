## A long hole stoping system for mining narrow platinum reefs
platinum reefs. The new system had to be substantially safer and more cost effective than conventional mining. We selected a site that was conducive to mechanized mining and set out the parameters that we considered would meet our requirements. We then conducted a feasibility study to evaluate the conceptualized long hole stoping system in

## Paper: Ideal stope profile to manage seismicity in deep tabular narrow 
Abstract: More regional stability pillars have been introduced in deep narrow reef mining stope designs with an aim of increasing the loading area and reducing the induced stress on the active mining stope faces creating a stiffer loading system. Mponeng mine introduced strike pillars into the conventional sequential grid mining layout in 2014 further reduce an already low extraction ratio.
