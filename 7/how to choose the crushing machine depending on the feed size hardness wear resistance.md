Support for large crushing ratios: Key parts are manufactured by special material. The space when the crushing cone leaves the concave is large in each stroke, allowing more material to enter the crushing chamber and forming a larger discharge volume, which speeds up the passage of the material through the crushing chamber.

## The Impact of Hardness and Durability in Poultry Feed
Hardness and durability are two characteristics of the presentation of poultry feed pellets. Durability reflects how the pellet holds up during the phases of transportation, from the feed mill to the animal's beak. It is now measured with a SABE device. Hardness is more a reflection on the state of the shell of the pellet.
