## Destructive & Non-Destructive Testing - Anderson Shumaker Company
Non-destructive testing (NDT) is an analysis technique to evaluate the component, material's property, structural characteristics differences, and disruption without causing damage. This method is also known as non-destructive evaluation (NDE), non-destructive examination (NDE), and non-destructive inspection (NDI).

## Non destructive Testing Techniques - IspatGuru
Non-destructive testing (NDT) is the technique of inspecting, testing, or evaluating materials, components, or assemblies for imperfections also known as discontinuities, or differences in characteristics without destroying the serviceability of the part or system. In other words, when the inspection or test is completed the part can still be used.
