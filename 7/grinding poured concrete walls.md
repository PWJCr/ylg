## Poured Concrete Walls vs. Concrete Block - Ask the Builder
Block walls can be as strong or stronger than poured walls. Block and concrete are strong in compression, but weak in tension. Reinforcing steel needs to be in block walls - both vertical and horizontal. Block cores must be filled with pea-gravel concrete. Poured, or cast, walls must have horizontal steel top and bottom.

A poured concrete wall is one that requires formwork, which can make preparation a more time-consuming process. However, the walls are reinforced with tie wires and spreader blocks to create even thickness, which can contribute to increased durability. Concrete walls and foundation walls can be further reinforced with rebar or metal rods.
