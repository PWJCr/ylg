## Construction Waste Processing Plant - Camelway Machinery
Construction Waste Processing Plant. A large amount of construction waste generated during the urbanization construction process, including construction waste, waste concrete, prefabricated panels, mortar, asphalt blocks, etc. These construction wastes not only pollute the environment, but also occupy large land area.

## Deconstruction can be applied on a number of levels to salvage usable 
Waste Management. Reuse and recycling could divert construction waste from waste stream back to the construction cycle. This can be achieved through balancing cut and fill, reusing items such as hoardings, formworks and scaffoldings and recycling materials such as metals, concrete and asphalt. Demolition waste can also be reused and recycled on.

A Medium-sized 250,000 tpa plant should cost $169 million, or $680 per ton of annual capacity. These numbers give us the first estimation of how much waste-to-energy is. Iowa City Community Compost, made from local yard and food waste, is sold in large or small quantities. When available, the compost costs $20 per ton with a $2 minimum.
