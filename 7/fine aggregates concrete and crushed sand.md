## Aggregates | Difference Between Coarse And Fine | How to do Shape and 
With most particles going through a 3/8-inch sieve, fine aggregates typically consist of natural sand or crushed stone. All particles larger than 0.19 inches are coarse aggregates but usually vary between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels make up much of the remaining coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone.

Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.

## Types Of Aggregates | Difference Between Coarse and fine aggregate
Fine aggregates comprise of natural sand and stone which are graded into Zone 1 to Zone 4 depending on its ability to move through the 600-micron. The zones become gradually finer from Zone-1 to Zone-4. As per zones, 90% to 100% of the fine aggregate moves through 4.75 mm IS sieve and 0 to 15% moves through 150 microns IS sieve. ?

## Aggregates - Eastern Concrete Materials
Aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone that, along with water and Portland cement, form the necessary ingredients in concrete. Aggregates need to be clean, hard, strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of fine materials that could cause the deterioration of concrete.

## Aggregate Size In Concrete | Coarse Vs Fine Aggregate - Union Quarries
Feb 3, 2022A cement mix using coarse aggregate may use a majority of coarse aggregate with a fine aggregate like crushed stone filling up the remainder. Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of aggregate often used in road construction.
