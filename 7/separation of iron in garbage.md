## What Type of Equipment is Needed for Metal Recycling? | MSS
Modern recycling equipment can identify many kinds of metals, although more complex technology is required to separate non-ferrous metals. Basic metal sorting involves separating ferrous from non-ferrous metals. Ferrous metals contain iron, and are attracted by magnets. This allows iron and steel to be pulled from a waste stream easily.

Mixtures can be separated using various separation methods such filtration,separating funnel,sublimation,simple distillation and paper chromatography. The methods stated above are all physical methods. There are also chemical methods, which are used by rearranging the particles so a certain substance no longer exists (chemical reaction).

Step 2: Separating - Separate as much of the metals as possible. This is important for high-quality recycling. Sort all the ferrous metals from the non-ferrous metals. A rule of thumb is that most ferrous metals, such as steel, are magnetic. Stainless steel is an exception because this metal contains a low percentage of iron.

## How important is waste separation? - Across The Green
Dec 16, 2021Waste separation (or waste segregation / trash sorting) is the process of sorting your trash into different bins depending on the materials or elements that it is composed of. This allows these items of trash to be more easily recycled as the trash facilities have separate streams of trash. It gives them much less sorting to do themselves.
