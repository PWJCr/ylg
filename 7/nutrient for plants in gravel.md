## Introduction to planted aquarium substrates - The 2Hr Aquarist
Sizes between 1-3mm are generally usable. Avoid planted aquarium substrate sands that are superfine (such as very fine grain silica sand), which compacts more easily. Fine sand is also stirred up too easily by livestock. Pea gravel on the other hand is a bit too coarse - smaller plants with fine root systems will not root well in it. MATERIAL

## Can You Grow Aquarium Plants in Gravel—The Best Plants for Gravel
Usually, most aquatic plants grow best in small gravel as opposed to large-chunky aquarium rocks. Thus it's best if you stick to a gravel grain size of 0.1 to 0.2 inches (3 to 5 millimeters) or use a coarse sand substrate that's between 0.12 and 2.0 inches in size. From experience, aquarium plants can grow fairly well in gravel such this
