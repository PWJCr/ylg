## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls.

Crushed ore is fed to the ball mill through the inlet; a scoop (small screw conveyor) ensures the feed is constant. For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged.

0.5 to 15 TPH Small Scale Miner's Ball Mill. Our small-scale miner's Ball Mills use horizontal rotating cylinders that contain the grinding media and the particles to be broken. The mass moves up the wall of the cylinder as it rotates and falls back into the "toe" of the mill when the force of gravity exceeds friction and centrifugal forces.

## using ball mills for mining
Ball mills, like the three roll machine, are a common occurrence in industry, for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process, there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation. The main factor contributing is the shear force applied by the balls. Using only shear force, one can produce large graphene flakes.
