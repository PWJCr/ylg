## Ball mill - Batch process | Lessine
The miling intensity depends mainly on the drum's speed, the balls size and material as well as the amount of time the product remains in the chamber. Depending on the application and the expected results, grinding can be done using a dry or a wet process. And, according to the desired flow rate, it can be batch or continuous milling.

## Cement mill
A Ball mill is a horizontal cylinder partly filled with steel balls (or occasionally other shapes) that rotates on its axis, imparting a tumbling and cascading action to the balls. Material fed through the mill is crushed by impact and ground by attrition between the balls. The grinding media are usually made of high-chromium steel.The smaller grades are occasionally cylindrical ("pebs

## The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide
22 May, 2019. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically
