Step 9. Now that you've smoothed the larger part of the surface area, you'll notice that you'll be left with an untouched section of concrete around the perimeter zone. This is unfortunately caused by the dust shroud plastic lip which obstructs the grinding wheel from smoothing the surface closest to the wall.
