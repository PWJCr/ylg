In order to maintain the maximum levels of capacity, gradation, and cubical product, a Cone Crusher must be choke-fed at all times. The best way to keep a choke-feed to the Cone Crusher is with a surge bin (or hopper) and feeder that are located prior to the crusher. Choke-feeding is almost impossible to achieve without a hopper and feeder.
