## Mining sector in Morocco diversifies away from phosphates
Although Morocco is home to a range of metals and minerals, the mining sector has long been dominated by phosphates. The kingdom possesses an estimated 77% of the world's total phosphate reserves and remains the leading global exporter. Currently the sector contributes 10% of Morocco's GDP, with 90% of this coming from phosphates.
