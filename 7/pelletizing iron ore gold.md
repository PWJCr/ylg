## pelletizing iron ore gold
Iron ore pellets are marble-sized balls of iron ore that are fused with clay for transportation, and used in steel manufacture. The process of making pellets from iron ore is called pelletizing. The manufacture of steel from a low-grade iron ore involves processes like mining, crushing, separating, concentrating, mixing, pelletizing, and shipping.

Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6-16 mm (0.24-0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces. They typically contain 64-72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets. [3] Typically limestone, dolomite and olivine is added and Bentonite is used as binder.

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Pelletizing is a process which involves mixing of very finely ground particles of iron ore fines having a size which is less than 200 mesh (0.074 mm) with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into near oval/spherical balls having size in the range of 8 mm to 16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel.

Pelletizing is the process through which iron ore fines are transformed into an agglomerated form called "iron ore pellets" suitable for use in an iron-making furnace at a steel mill, such as a blast furnace or electric arc furnace. In its end product form, a typical iron ore pellet is roughly spherical in shape, measuring from 6 mm to 16

## The Guide to Iron Ore Pelletizing | Sree Metaliks
Pelletizing, as a process, was introduced to the world only post WWII. There was a scarcity of high-grade natural iron ore in the US. Therefore, there was a need to utilize low-grade iron, and this introduced the process of pelletization. Additionally, pellets are used to feed the blast furnaces and direct reduced iron-producing units.
