## An Overview of Basic Gold Separation Methods
Panning. Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.

## American Gold Miner | Gold Mining Equipment
Since 2009 we have been testing, researching, and building equipment with the single goal to find equipment that effectively removes fine gold from magnetic and nonmagnetic sands. In 2010 with our Black Gold Magnetic Separator we solved fine gold losses trapped in magnetic sands. In 2016 we were pleased to introduce the Neffco Centrifuge Bowl

## Sand Gold Mine Gravity Separation - Afuruika
Sand Gold Mine Gravity Separation. Process description : Gravity separation is one of the commonly used methods of gold ore beneficiation. It uses different proportions of materials and different sedimentation speeds in the medium to carry out layer separation. Generally, in placer gold mines, gold mostly exists in the form of single natural
