Here the granitoids of the Ulakhan massif were dated at 98 Â± 1 Ma by the U-Pb SHRIMP method (Akinin et al., 2011). These granitoids metamorphose gold-quartz veins at the Igumenovskoe and Rodionovskoe deposits (Firsov, 1956, 1958; Skornyakov, 1949) and are, in this case, post-ore for the orogenic gold-sulfide-quartz mineralization.
