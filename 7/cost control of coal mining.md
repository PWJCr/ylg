The actual methane control cost should also be calculated as the cost in the 2014 standard is not actual. The main methane control engineering cost is mainly incurred before coal mining, while the indirect methane control cost is in the process of coal mining.

Cutting costs of mine support systems. Full Record; Other Related Research; Abstract. Support systems for a large underground coal mine are broken down into five areas: transportation, ventilation, drainage, haulage and power. An example of cost-saving design concerns a mine entry ventilation system.
