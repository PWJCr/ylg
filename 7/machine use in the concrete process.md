Before the invention of the mixing machine, the entire mixing process used to be done by hand, shovel, shallow box. But now due to the high demand in construction, different types of mechanical procedures and machines are used for mixing. The concrete mixer was invented by Gebhardt Jaeger who was an industrialist at Columbus, Ohio.

## Casting Machines Selection Guide: Types, Features, Applications 
Casting Machines Information. Casting machines represent the collection of equipment that is used to shape and form molten metal into various shapes and forms by the use of a die. This includes the furnaces, ladles, tundishes, impression devices, clamping units, dies, and gating systems that are found on most casting machines.

## Statistical complications please | Physics Forums
A roadway construction process uses a machine that pours concrete onto the roadway and measures the thinckness of the concrete so the roadway will measure up to the required depth in inches. The concrete thickness needs to be consistent across the road, but the machine isn't perfect and it is costly to operate.

## Concrete Milling 101 - What is the concrete milling process?
Concrete milling is the process of removing the top layers of a concrete surface. It's carried out using scarifying machines equipped with diamond-tipped blades. Milling operations are effective at creating level, smooth surfaces that provide a lot of traction. Plus, the material that's chipped away can be repurposed for aggregate material
