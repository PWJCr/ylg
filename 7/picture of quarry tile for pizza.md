I recently finished a project of converting a domestic electric oven into a quarry tile pizza oven. I've been lurking around the site for a while learning and thought it's time to participate. I got most of the parts from an old frigidaire electric oven. I began by making a frame to hold the quarry tiles. The metal came from an old bed frame.

Be sure that you have at least an inch or more space around the outside edge of the tiles for good air circulation. Heat them on low for an hour or so, then just leave them in the oven to heat whenever you use the oven. When baking a pizza on tiles or a pizza stone, you need to preheat the oven for 30-45 minutes or an hour to get it really hot.

## Cooking & Preserving Foods:Ceramic tile pizza stone? - Dave's Garden
I top the pizza on the rimless pan and carry it over to the oven. It slides easily off the cornmeal sheet and onto the tile. The use of unglazed tile allows for as large a pizza as will fit in the oven. I cut extra tiles to bring them out to the edges and make an even larger surface than the tile would otherwise cover.

## Picture Of Quarry Tile For Pizza
Jan 20, 2013 With quarry tiles, you can stack them to simulate a brick oven as in the picture below. I would add a row on the rack above the pizza to enclose the cooking area. Use the highest heat your oven can reach and preheat for 45-60 minutes.
