## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed.  The iron ore pelletizing process consists of three main steps: Pelletizing feed preparation and mixing: the

Iron Mining Process. From blasting to crushing to separation - more than 85% of the iron mined in the United States is mined in northeastern Minnesota to make our nation's steel. Blasting Taconite is a very hard rock. Using explosives, the taconite is blasted into small pieces.  The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism

Ore is a mineral or a collection of minerals (rock) which may be operated economically. Iron ore, for example, Vale's main product occurs as oxides, carbonates, sulfides and silicates, being the most abundant oxides and greater commercial interest. Our ore, for example, consists mainly of oxides hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4).

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Pig iron
Pig iron, also known as crude iron, is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8-4.7%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.

How steel is made. First, the raw materials, either iron ore or scrap iron (depending on the process), are converted into molten steel. The ore-based process uses a blast furnace or smelter and the scrap-based process uses an electric arc furnace. Next, the molten steel is poured and solidified in a continuous caster.
