## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Jaw Crushers Work A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.

## Which motor is preferred for jaw crusher?f
How many types of jaw crushers are there? There are two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action. A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates.

## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
A fixed jaw, mounted in a V-shaped alignment, is the stationary breaking surface, while a movable, "swing" jaw exerts force on the feed material by pushing it against the stationary plate. The space at the bottom of the "V"-aligned jaw plates is the output gap that dictates the size of the crushed product from the jaw crusher.

## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.
