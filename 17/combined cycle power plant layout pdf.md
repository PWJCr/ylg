##  Operational Flexibility Enhancements of Combined Cycle Power Plants
Typically, combined cycle power plants built in the 1990s and early years of the new millennium were designed as base load plants with focus on highest efficiency and low initial cost. Due to the significant increase in gas prices and changing market conditions in deregulated markets many combined cycle power plants are now being operated in

## Combined Cycle Power Plant | GE Gas Power
How a combined cycle power plant produces electricity This is how a combined-cycle plant works to produce electricity and captures waste heat from the gas turbine to increase efficiency and electrical output. 1) Gas turbine burns fuel: The gas turbine compresses air and mixes it with fuel that is heated to a very high temperature.

## Gas--steam turbine combined cycle power plants (Technical Report 
To date, most of the applications of combined cycles have been for electric power generation only. The basic gas--steam turbine combined cycle consists of: (1) a gas turbine-generator set, (2) a waste-heat recovery boiler in the gas turbine exhaust stream designed to produce steam, and (3) a steam turbine acting as a bottoming cycle.
