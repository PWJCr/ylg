## The devastating impact of Gold Mining in South Africa
For 130 years South Africa has been exploiting its gold resources in Johannesburg. But at what cost? 278 abandoned mines and 200 mining dumps, that contain about 6 billion tons of waste, exist in Johannesburg. For every single gram of gold extracted, 200 kg of waste are produced. Inside the city, hills composed of sand debris arise.
