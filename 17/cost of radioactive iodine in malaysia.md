These medications need to be stopped for two weeks before Radioactive Iodine can be administered. Following administration of the RAI, your cat will need to be hospitalised for a period of 15 days. RAI is injected under the skin (like a vaccination). The thyroid gland then takes this up so other parts of the body are not affected.

## Feline Radioactive Iodine Treatment for Hyperthyroidism - Long Animal
Creates difficulty in identifying/removing the entire tumor. Leads to persistence of Hyperthyroidism post-surgery (80% of cases already have another tumor on the opposite side that will become clinically significant within 1.5 years). Costs $700-$1300 for one surgery. Is often performed in two surgeries.

## Radioactive iodine treatment - Cancer Council NSW
Radioactive iodine treatment. Radioactive iodine (RAI) is also known as I131 and is a type of radioisotope treatment. Radioisotopes are radioactive substances given in a pill that you swallow. Although RAI spreads through the body, it is mainly absorbed by thyroid cells or thyroid cancer cells. RAI kills these cells while leaving other body

Costs $1500-$2000 for one surgery. Is often performed in two surgeries. Leaves thyroid tissue in the chest where the tumor can recur. Leaves many cats still needing I-131 therapy, even after undergoing one or more surgeries. As you can see, Radioiodine therapy is the clear treatment of choice and the only consistent cure for Feline Hyperthyroidism.
