## screening and crushing iron ore beneficiation equipment
After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc, iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore The beneficiation process should be as efficient and simple as possible, such as the development ofore beneficiation procedure Screening is an important step for dry beneficiation of iron ore Crushing and

## Iron Mining Process - Minnesota Iron
Crushing At the processing plant, the taconite is crushed into very small pieces by rock crushing machines. The crushers keep crushing the rock until it is the size of a marble. The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. Separation The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism.
