## Unlocking millions of tonnes of nickel - CSIRO
Traditional nickel laterite processing techniques use large quantities of sulphuric acid at high temperatures and pressures, resulting in expensive waste treatment and disposal of the chemicals used in the extraction process. Nickel laterites are becoming a priority for mining companies as traditional nickel sulphide reserves are depleted.

## Nickel mining in Indonesia
Nickel mining in Indonesia began with small-scale exploratory mining operations during the Dutch East Indies era and began to expand in the 1960s.  It has been equipped to process 13 million tons of nickel ore annually. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said that the new smelter, which produces ferronickel, is expected to increase the nickel

## Lateritic nickel ore deposits
Nickel laterites are a very important type of nickel ore deposit. They are growing to become the most important source of nickel metal for world demand (currently second to sulfide nickel ore deposits ). Nickel laterites are generally mined via open cut mining methods. Nickel is extracted from the ore by a variety of process routes.

## There's an obvious distinction betweennes-delaurent.fr
Feb 18, 2022 · Open-pit mining is an extraction process that occurs on the surface of a mining site. It's also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and it is a type of mineral or rock extraction that does not require tunnelling into the earth. Just like with other types of mining, there are its pros and cons.

## Extraction of Nickel | Nickel Ore Mining | Mining Equipment for Sale
The extraction of nickel process generally consists of crushing, sieving, washing, re-selection, grinding, and slurry concentration, or the nickel leaching method. The target element nickel distribution varies with the nature of the ore, mostly contained in fine-grained grades. For example, the nickel minerals of the Ramu laterite mine in Papua

## How does Nickeline mining work? : r/ChemicalEngineering
Nickel is not so expensive it woul be worth it, I think. I'm not an expert though and would be happy to learn the facts. Wikipedia says that it's pretty rare to use it for mining, but "pretty rare" isn't the same as never. I'm asking because I'm looking to write a story around it and I want some details.
