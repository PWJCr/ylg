For alluvial tin ore with a lot of sticky clay, ore washing will be needed to break the clay blocks besides screening. This will lower the possibility of tin coated by clay and improve the recovery rate and concentrating efficiency as well. The ore washing machine for alluvial tin processing is usually rotary ore washing machine, ore log washer.

tin processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Tin (Sn) is a relatively soft and ductile metal with a silvery white colour. It has a density of 7.29 grams per cubic centimetre, a low melting point of 231.88 °C (449.38 °F), and a high boiling point of 2,625 °C (4,757 °F). Tin is allotropic; that is, it takes on more than one form. The normal form is white tin, or beta
