## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C (840° to 1,380° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in

## Gold Extraction Techniques - Manhattan Gold & Silver
One of the earliest methods for extracting gold, salt cementation, was perfected through the Iron Age. When the Lydian Empire was standardizing the purity of the gold and silver they were using for the world's earliest coinage, this was the method they relied on. When mined, gold is commonly merged with silver as an alloy called electrum.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Ore Refining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
7.1.6 METAL REFINING OF ORES. In the metal refining of ores, the metal is solubilized in an aqueous solution. The optical control of metal refining requires quick, accurate analysis of the major chemical species present in solution. Raman spectroscopy and resonance Raman are used to identify the amine complexes of Co, Ni, and Cu species, as
