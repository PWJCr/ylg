## Basalt Rock - Formation, Properties, Uses, Construction and FAQs - VEDANTU
Basalt is an extrusive igneous or volcanic rock that has a low silica content, dark in colour, and is very rich in iron and magnesium. Basalt rock is mainly composed of pyroxene, olivine, and plagioclase and is the most common rock on the earth's surface. The texture of basalt rocks is coarsely porous as those holes are left by gas bubbles.

## Why Is Basalt Important - Realonomics
Why basalt is often used for construction? High strength to weight ratio : Basalt fiber is 3 times lighter and up to 2.5 times stronger in tensile strength than steel. Chemical and corrosion resistance: Basalt fiber doesn't rust and is resistant to the action of salt ions chemicals and the alkalinity inherent in concrete.

Why is basalt used in construction? Basalt rebar made from basalt rock is a material with wide range of acceptance in the construction field for past few decades, due to its non-corrosive nature.These non-corrosive rebars have the potential to replace steel in reinforced concrete and can also increase the durability of concrete structures.

Is Basalt a mineral or rock? Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro.
