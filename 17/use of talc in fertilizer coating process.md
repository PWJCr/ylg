## Preventing Fertilizer Caking With a Coating Drum - FEECO International Inc.
Coating, when used in partnership with other best practices, offers producers a way to minimize the potential for caking, and subsequently, their exposure to the associated risks. The process of coating granular fertilizers with anti-caking agents must be thoroughly tested to produce a product that will truly minimize the potential for caking.

## Use of Talc | The Olive Oil Source
Talc is a widely used additive in the milling process throughout the world. While many neophytes to the business balk at the use of talc, it is an accepted industry practice, just not a very heavily publicized one. Talc helps increase yields when used with high quality fruit and also facilitates the milling of difficult fruit such as overwatered and/or over-ripe fruit.

## Talc in Plastics & Polymers - Avani Group of Industries
Talc is a soft mineral and easily micronizable into fine particle sizes. Subsequently, these fine particles of Talc efficiently fill up inter-particular spaces within polymer compounds. This, in turn, increases the stiffness and impact strength of plastics and polymers. Talc has better thermal conductivity in comparison to polymer.
