## Conveyors & their Safety Features | RLS HUMAN CARE
For moving material normally two types of equipment are used. Conveyors are used when the path is fixed and industrial trucks are used when the path is free. Various types of conveyors and mono-rail systems are used in many industries to eliminate manual labor to expedite the movement of materials and also to facilitate the processing or assembling. Belt conveyors are widely used and they are of flat or trough type and can be horizontal or inclined.

## 10 Best Practices to Minimize Conveyor Belt Risks - Compactor 
Every year, most of the accidents and injuries related to conveyor belt systems occur because people working with and around them tend to ignore the most basic rule of safety pertaining to these systems. As per this rule, people should never stand, ride, walk, touch or sit on the conveyor belts at any time. But often out of mischief or negligence, people take these systems for granted and overlook this basic rule, which results in health hazards.
