For normal concrete strength, the cube size of 150mmx150mmx150mm is already sufficient for the crushing strength of the machine. Cube Test:  Concrete cube mould with size 150mm or 100mm is applied for aggregate size of not more than 40mm and 25mm. Cube mould for test should be formed into steel or cast iron containing smooth inner surface

Before the concrete is scooped into the moulds, the moulds must be lightly coated in a mould release agent. This ensures that the concrete does not stick to the mould and makes it easier to remove the cube. When using a 150mm mould, the concrete sample is scooped into the mould in 3 equal layers (50mm) and compacted between each layer.

are required, for example to remove a concrete shutter safely prior to 7 days. Usually 1 cube will be tested at 7 days and 2 cubes at 28 days, however this may vary depending of the requirements, check the design first. The cubes are removed from the curing tank, dried and grit removed. The cubes are tested using a calibrated compression machine.

## Discussion: Cube tests and the uniaxial compressive strength of concrete
workers that the crushing strength of concrete, deter­ mined from the crushing strength of a cube or cylinder, is affected by factors which are not intrinsic to con­ crete and whose influence is not so obvious and direct. Important among these are the shape and size of test specimens, surface friction between the ends of the specimen and
