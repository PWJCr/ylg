## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e. gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as color) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calverite (AuTe), aurostibnite (AuSb

## The Extraction of Gold from E-waste by Hydrometallurgy
To solve the problems and extract valuable metals by hydrometallurgy, leaching and organic solvent are used. To do this, after a specific amount of electrical and electronic waste was crushed, ground, and refined, it was sampled. Then, the sample was washed with water, and its remaining was leached into nitric acid.

A simple one-step method for the extraction of gold from wastes as nanoparticles stabilized by phospholipids is demonstrated. This is achieved by applying an AC voltage for 5s to the gold-containing wastes, which act as the electrodes in a buffer solution containing a dispersed phospholipid (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DOPC).

Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process. The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity. With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand. Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust. Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.
