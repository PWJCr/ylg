Other articles where vat leaching is discussed: gold processing: Cyanidation: .ore), cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching, which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent for several hours in large tanks equipped with agitators. For extracting gold from low-grade ores, heap leaching is practiced. The huge heaps described above are sprayed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide

The copper deposit in Yangla zone of China is large, and its recovery is low only using flotation process. Therefore, the copper in the flotation tailings is leached by sulfuric acid can improve copper recovery.

Metallurgical tests conducted on the ore showed that sulphidization was ineffective to recover a significant part of the oxidized copper. However, the leach- precipitation-flotation process, commonly referred to as LPF, was shown to be economically feasible. Basically, the L-P-F process consists of dissolving the oxidized copper minerals with sulphuric acid and precipitating the copper as a metallic sponge which responds to flotation.

The obtained Cu-concentrate is sent to the pyrometallurgical process. If grinding is not fine enough for efficient flotation, copper is lost in tailings. In this paper, the ferric leaching of slag flotation tailings is studied. Copper extractions of 66% are achieved by ferric leaching, and Cu content in tailings is reduced from 0.78% to 0.24%.

## Copper extraction
Supergene sulfide ores rich in native copper minerals are refractory to treatment with sulfuric acid leaching on all practicable time scales, and the dense metal particles do not react with froth flotation media. Typically, if native copper is a minor part of a supergene profile it will not be recovered and will report to the tailings.

## Special Issue "Flotation and Leaching Processes in Metallurgy" - MDPI
Mar 31, 2022Flotation and leaching processes are the most used for metal extraction in the mining industry. Froth flotation involves an intense treatment of their tails, affecting how water can be recycled in upstream operations. This is of great relevance, considering that the concentration circuits consume the highest proportion of water resources.

## The Magic Effect of Lime in Mineral Processing - JXSC Machine
Contact Now +. Published time：20 February 2021. Lime is widely used in mineral processing areas, like beneficiation processing, flotation processing, and leach processing. Also, lime can be used to raises the pH value, thus precipitating metals diluted in the water into tailing areas. And limestone is often used in the
