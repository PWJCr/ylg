## Life cycle assessment of iron ore mining and processing
The extraction of iron ore involves surface (open-pit) or underground mining techniques (please refer to Chapter 7 (Stace, 2015) on Iron Ore Extraction Techniques). The LCA boundary used in this study is shown in Figure 20.4.The mining method selected depends on a variety of factors, including the nature and location of the deposit and the size, depth, and grade of the deposit.

## Iron ore
Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals. It is highly capital intensive, and requires significant investment in infrastructure such as rail in order to transport the ore from the mine to a freight ship. For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands

##  Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Mining Industry 4
4.1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are: • Surface mining or open-pit mining • Underground or shaft mining To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice, although there are exceptions. Small, low-capacity mines have rapidly disappeared.

Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China, Australia, Brazil, India and Russia. These countries account for around 85 % of the total global iron ore mining volume.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
