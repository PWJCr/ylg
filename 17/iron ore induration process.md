##  Study on the Induration Cycle During Pelletization of Goethitic Iron Ore
Several investigations1-7 were carried out to study the induration of iron ore green pellets. However, most of such studies have been based on either with total induration process or modelling on the induration process. Relatively few studies6 have been reported on the drying stage of the induration process.

## A dynamic mathematical model of the complete grate/kiln iron-ore pellet 
Induration (drying and hardening) of iron ore pellets is an energy-intensive feed preparation step for both the blast furnace and direct reduction routes to iron. It is commonly carried out by a 'grate/kiln' process. A mathematical model of the process is described, in which mechanistic models of the grate furnace, kiln, and cooler are linked to enable simulation of the entire process.

## Modeling and simulation of iron ore pellet drying and induration process
Abstract: We present a mathematical model of iron ore pellet drying and induration in an industrial scale application, and validate it against measured data. The model is based on the laws of mass and heat transfer, and incorporates both physical and chemical processes. The partial differential equations of the process kinetic model involve derivatives in time and bed depth.

## Iron ore pellet sector: Environmental agreement
In the pelletizing process, iron ore concentrate is rolled into balls (pellets) and hardened through thermal treatment in an induration furnace. The induration furnace is the primary source of emissions from this sector of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), inhalable particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5 ), and oxides of nitrogen (NO x );

## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
When the iron ore is extracted from the mine, it must undergo several processing stages. Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.
