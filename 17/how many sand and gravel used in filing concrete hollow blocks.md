## How Much Sand And Gravel In A Yard Of Concrete? | BagOfConcrete
You need two parts of sand and three parts of gravel (2:3) in a yard of concrete. One part cement, two parts sand, and three parts gravel make up an average 1:2:3 mix. You'd need seven 94-pound bags of cement, half a cubic yard of sand, and a little more than 3/4 cubic yard of gravel to build 1 cubic yard of concrete.
