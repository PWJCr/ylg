## Effect of copper slag as fine aggregate replacement in high strength 
The objective of the present study is to utilize high volume copper slag (i.e. 100%) as a replacement to fine aggregate and partially replacing cement with Nano silica. The work is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the fine aggregate is replaced with copper slag in different percentages of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.

## What Is Grading Of Aggregates? And Its Limits [Civil Planets]
Significance of Grading The aggregates are graded as per IS code 383, when the aggregate size is less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate & more than 4.75mm is called coarse aggregate. The aggregate gradation is determined by the fineness modulus method where aggregates are passing through the sieve as per IS standard to classify its size.

For fine aggregate, the following statements are true: If the fine aggregate is too coarse, harshness, bleeding and segregation may occur. If the fine aggregate is too fine, the mix will require additional water and segregation may occur. If the grading varies significantly, the workability of the fresh concrete will likely suffer as a result.

In general, the specific gravity of copper slag will vary with its iron content. The unit weight of copper slag is higher than that of conventional aggregate. As a general rule, the specific gravity will vary with iron content, from a low of 2.8 to as high as 3.8. The absorption of the material is typically very low.

## (PDF) Study on Strength Enhancement Factors of Cement-Stabilized 
When the cement grade, dosage, and grading type were kept the same, the strength of cement-stabilized crushed stone prepared with larger aggregates was slightly lower.

##  Copper slag as fine aggregate for high performance concrete - WIT Press
The effect of copper slag addition as replacement of fine aggregate on the density of normal and high strength concretes is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that there is general increase in the density of both normal and high strength concretes with the increase of copper slag replacement in the concrete.

## Grading Of Aggregate | Ultimate Guide - Construction How
Fig. 7: Fine Aggregates Grading Requirement as per ASTM Standard C33/C33M-18. The 'American Standard for Testing and Materials' (commonly known as ASTM) provides guidelines for gradation of aggregates so that the concrete mix made following the standard recommendations does not fall short of adequate workability, durability and strength.. However, it is to kept in mind that apart from
