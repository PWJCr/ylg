Your Single Disc Surface Grinding Machine will look like a horizontal spindle surface grinding machine albeit smaller in size since it does not need a reciprocating or circular table. The grinding action in your machine takes place by the abrasive particles on the face of the grinding wheel. You will be able to give the feed (depth of cut) by moving the wheel head.

## Business
Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). It is also "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit." Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.
