To determine the maximum load capacity of your deck, start by calculating its total area and multiply by 50 psf. So a 100 sqft deck would be designed to support 5000 lbs. Don't get confused with what weight you might think or want to load the deck with. If you drove a dump truck over it, yes this would throw all our calculations out the window.

To improve the accuracy of the coal load detection based on the kinetic energy of balls in a tubular ball mill, a Discrete Element Method (DEM) model for ball kinematics based on coal loads is proposed. The operating process for a ball mill and the ball motion, as influenced by the coal quality and the coal load, was analyzed carefully.
