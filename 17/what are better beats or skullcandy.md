## How good is Skullcandy? : r/HeadphoneAdvice - reddit
Skullcandy/Bose/Beats are for people who don't care about music, just having something good to look at stuffed in their ears to fight the noises outside. Wireless overhead headphones. I'd personally go for Sony just because their better build and QC. Soundwise wouldn't be night and day since you're cap'd by bluetooth anyway.
