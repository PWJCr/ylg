## Calcium Carbonate | Calcite
Calcium carbonate is a common compound found on Earth with a chemical composition of CaCO₃.It is found in rocks such as marble, limestone, chalk, travertine, etc. and is extracted by mining or quarrying. Ground calcium carbonate is one of the most versatile and widely used minerals today.

##  Calcite Contactors for Corrosion Control in Small Systems - PNWS-AWWA
Calcite contactors use limestone to add calcium carbonate to water, which raises pH, and adds alkalinity. • Advantages: - Easy and safe to operate - Reduced operating cost - Self adjusts the water pH without risk of alkali overdose - Increases alkalinity - Requires minimal maintenance and operator skill

Limestone Formation. Calcite, dolomite and aragonite are limestone minerals so where did they came from. It is a sedimentary rock. It forms predominantly on the sea floor where material rich in calcium carbonate ('calcareous' material) accumulates. This calcareous material may be organic, chemical or detrital in origin.

Calcite also forms flat, rhomboid "poker chip" crystals, but dolomite does not. Calcite responds vigorously to acid, while dolomite responds less vigorously. Calcite is 3 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness, but dolomite is only Mohs 4-4.5. One other difference you may see is the smoothness of the crystal faces on your specimen.

## Difference Between Limestone and Chalk
The key difference between limestone and chalk is that the limestone contains both minerals, calcite, and aragonite whereas chalk is a form of limestone which contains calcite.. Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock.It mainly contains different crystal forms of calcium carbonate. Therefore this mineral is highly alkaline. Chalk is a form of limestone.
