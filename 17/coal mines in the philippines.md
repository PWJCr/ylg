## Where is the largest coal deposit in the Philippines?
Which state has the most natural coal deposits? Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the United States, produced 39% of total U.S. coal production and 72% of the coal mined in the Western coal region. Six of the top ten largest U.S. coal-producing mines were in Wyoming, and all of those mines are surface mines.
