Rounded off it's basically a 1 : 3 : 3 mix ratio. If I break the weights down per yard of concrete it comes to: 1. Cement = 510.75 pounds. 2. Stone = 1658.75 pounds. 3. Sand = 1496.25 pounds. A sack or "bag" of cement weighs 94 pounds so this tells us a 3000 psi concrete mix is also equal to a 5.5 sack mix of concrete.

Sep 17, 2020Using the ACI 211.1 method, here is an abbreviated run-through on how to design a mix: Choose the target slump. Choose the maximum aggregate size—remember that the larger the better for reducing shrinkage and curling. Estimate the water and air content using ACI 211.1 Table 6.3.3.

## M30 Grade of Concrete Mix Design Procedure with OPC 53 Cement - CivilJungle
Convert Volume into Weight for Concrete Mix. This formula can be used for any grade of concrete mix design. Formula = material weight = material volume x percentage of total volume x material sp. gravity x total volume. Mass of coarse aggregates 20 mm = 0.745 x 0.60 x 0.50 x 2.885 x 1000 = 644.8 Kg. Say 645 Kg.

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate Quantity in Concrete 
Concrete Ingredients Calculation. For Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate. This is a Volumetric Calculation. Assuming we need 2 m 3 of concrete for M20 Concrete Mix, (Mix Ratio, M20 = 1 : 1.5 : 3) Total Part of the Concrete = 1+1.5+3 = 5.5 Parts. Therefore, Cement Quantity = (Cement Part / Concrete Parts )  Concrete Volume

## Design Mix Of Concrete - Detailed Procedure With Calculation
As per IS 10262: 2009, Table 2 for nominal maximum Size of 20mm Aggregates, water content per cubic meter of concrete is equal to 186 Kgs (20-50mm slump range). Add 3% for every additional 25mm slump that is 6.0%. Estimate water content for 100mm slump is equal to (186+ ( (6.0/100)x186) = 197.16 kg.

The concrete mix design for 2013's Warren J. Baker Center for Science and Mathematics at California Polytechnic State University utilizes Arcosa Lightweight's Hydrolite™ product manufactured in Frazier Park. HydroLite is an expanded clay aggregate with a lightweight ceramic shell and honeycomb core.
