## Mining and Water Pollution — Safe Drinking Water Foundation
3. Processing Chemicals Pollution. This kind of pollution occurs when chemical agents (such as cyanide or sulphuric acid used by mining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore) spill, leak, or leach from the mine site into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can be highly toxic to humans and wildlife. 4.

## Illegal mining poses a major threat to mines and quarries - Quarrying 
Illegal mining is a growing trend in South Africa. Illegal mining and gangsterism threaten to derail the country's mining and quarrying industry, unless role players urgently pull together to urgently bring the scourge to a halt, warns surface mining industry association, ASPASA. ASPASA, one of the most vocal organisations on the topic, says

## Quarrying | MCR Safety
A quarry is a place, most often recognized as a dip pit, from which stone and rock is excavated from the ground. Today's quarrying industry produces crushed stone, granite, marble, sand, and gravel. Most of these minerals are close to the surface, making surface mining or opening pit mining the primary form of mining.

The quarrying process consists of separating large blocks, sometimes called loafs, from the surrounding rock. These blocks may be 6 metres high by 6 metres deep and 12 to 18 metres (about 40 to 60 feet) long, and they may weigh in the range of 1,200 to 2,000 tons. (Such large blocks are subsequently divided into mill blocks weighing 15 to 70 tons.)
