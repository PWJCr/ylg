## Effect of fibers addition on mechanical properties of eco-friendly 
The compressive strength of HPGC without fiber (mixture R) was recorded as 42.60 MPa. Compressive strength of HPGC added with 0.35% and 0.70% basalt fibers was 39.68 MPa and 41.38 MPa; this is 6.9% and 2.9% lower than the reference, respectively. Similar phenomenon was found for the HPGC added with 0.35%, 0.70%, and 1.35% glass fibers.

Apr 1, 2021The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) is a mechanical property of intact rocks that is important in civil and mining engineering works (Aladejare 2020; Aladejare et al. 2020; Wang and Aladejare 2016a).Design and stability analysis of underground excavations and other geotechnical structures require the input of data like UCS on the geomechanical behaviour of rocks (Ulusay et al. 1994).

Compression test Compression strength of concrete with and without basalt was conducted. The compression test was conducted as per IS 516 - 1959. The specimens were kept in water for curing for 7 days, 14 days and 28 days and on removal were tested in dry condition and grit present on the surface.

## Experimental investigation on compressive strength and chloride 
Test results indicated that hybrid fibers can effectively improve the compressive strength of concrete; that the maximum increases in compressive strength of C30, C40, and C50 concrete were 9.18%, 5.06%, and 7.13%, respectively; and that the effect of basalt fiber on compressive strength was greater than that of polypropylene fiber.

## Compressive Property of Basalt Fiber in Composite with Nano-indentation
The small diameter of the basalt fibres, which is usually less than 20 Î¼m, causes difficultyin measuring the axial compressive strength. Several techniques have been proposed including the loop test10, the recoil test11-13, the micro-compression test14-17, compression test of a single-fibre composite9,18 and estimation

## Mechanical Degradation and Failure Analysis of Different Glass/Basalt 
Aug 25, 2022Regardless, the reinforcing fibers still carried the load until the onset of compressive failure in the upper ply. For dry conditions,  However, in our case glass fiber reinforced composite was higher in strength than basalt. Additionally, the improved flexural strength of the hybrid composite, in comparison with the plain laminates, could
