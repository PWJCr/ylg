## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Learning Technology
The aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. It is expressed as the percentage by mass of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test sample is subjected to a specified load under standard conditions. Aggregates with lower crushing value

## Aggregate Crushing Value - Civil Engineering Portal - Biggest Civil 
AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE This test helps to determine the aggregate crushing value of coarse aggregates as per IS: 2386 (Part IV) - 1963. The apparatus used is Cylindrical measure and plunger, Compression testing machine, IS Sieves of sizes - 12.5mm, 10mm and 2.36mm  What is the effect of ACV experiment on Crushing value? Reply.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Experiment
Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Determine Aggregate. May 17 2019 The ' aggregate crushing value test ` gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under
