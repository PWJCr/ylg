## Home Grain Milling 101: The Basics | Traditional Cooking School
Generally, you start with clean grain. There's no need to wet or rinse the grains, however, it's a good idea to inspect the grains and remove rocks or debris manually. Rocks, especially, can damage your mill. Then, add the grain to the mill and turn it on. Along the way, adjust the fineness/coarseness.

## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE - Engineering Tutorials
Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating, cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling, slotting, making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.
