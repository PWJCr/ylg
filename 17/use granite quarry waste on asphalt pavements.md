## Decomposed granite
The average cost of decomposed granite amounts to $0.50 to $1 per square foot. This assumes a depth of 6 inches, which is what professional installers recommend for driveways and other areas that need to support lots of weight. When you consider delivery and installation, you'll pay closer to $1 to $3 per square foot for the material.
