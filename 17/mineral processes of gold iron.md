## Introduction Of Gold Mining Process
The gold mining process mainly includes the following methods: cyanidation process, flotation process, gravity separation process and mercury amalgamation process. See more details on the four kind of gold mining process. 8. Water treatment of mining process Dewatering of coarse-grained materials is relatively easy.

It is least costly to extract the iron from oxide minerals like hematite Fe 2 O 3, magnetite Fe 3 O 4, or limonite FeOH. Although iron also occurs in olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and biotite

Extraction of gold and other precious metals from their ores by treatment with mercury is called amalgamation. Gold dissolves in aqua regia, a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, and in sodium or potassium cyanide. The latter solvent is the basis for the cyanide process that is used to recover gold from low-grade ore.
