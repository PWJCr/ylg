## 5 Methods of Gold-Silver Ore Extraction | Mining Pedia
The silver chloride obtained by roasting is easily dissolved in the cyanidation process. But the chlorination roasting has the following disadvantages: 1) The consumption of sodium chloride is large (up to 10~15% of the weight of the material); 2) The chlorides of gold and silver will volatilize and escape, causing the loss of gold and silver.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal.Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element.Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as

## Gold Extraction from Cyanidation Tailing Using Microwave Chlorination 
At present, gold mines are increasingly scarce in the world. The yield of cyanidation tailing (CT) of refractory gold ores with a grade of 10 g/T is huge; however, the effective capitalization of the cyanidation tailing is a significant problem in the gold industry. In this work, a new treatment method, a microwave-roasting process developed. The effect of roasting temperature, calcium
