## Problems With Extracting Aluminium From Ore-HN Mining Machinery 
The principal ore from which aluminum is extracted is called bauxite after the town of Les Baux in southern France. Red mud is composed mainly of fine particles of silica, aluminum, iron, calcium, and titanium oxides in different proportions dependent upon the bauxite ore, aluminum extraction conditions, and quality control.

## Extraction of Aluminium (Aluminium Ore) - Hall-Heroults Process & Uses 
The Hall-Heroult process is widely used in the extraction of aluminium. In Hall-Heroults process, pure Al 2 O 3 is mixed with CaF 2 or Na 3 AlF 6. This results in lowering the melting point of the mixture and increases its ability to conduct electricity. A steel vessel with a lining of carbon and graphite rods is used.
