##  How phosphate is mined and processed
rock phosphate can become soluble (and available to plants) either by chemical weathering or through the actions of certain types of plants. The solubility also depends on rock type and the pH of the soil; phosphorus is most soluble when contained in sedimentary rocks as opposed to igneous rock, and when soil pH is between 5.5 and 7.2.

## Mineral Processing And Extractive Metallurgy : 100 Years Of Innovation 
Bayer Process The second major hydrometallurgical process of this era was the process invented by Karl Josef Bayer (Figure 22) for the preparation of pure Al2O3 and is known as the Bayer process. This process was concerned with leaching bauxite with sodium hydroxide solution above its boiling point in a pressure reactor.
