## machines used at the mines
Surface mining can be used when the coal is buried less than 200 feet underground In surface mining, giant machines remove the top-soil and layers of rock to expose large beds of coal Once the mining is finished, the dirt and rock are returned to the pit, the topsoil is replaced, and the area is replanted

## From Shovels to Machines - West Virginia
The Mines Today. From the days of the salt industry until the 1940s, most coal was loaded using hand tools like picks and shovels. Machines were introduced gradually during the early 1900s, allowing miners to load more coal in less time. Mechanization began with undercutting machines around 1900 and advanced to loading machines in the 1920s.

The coal is loaded on to large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or direct to where it will be used. Large opencast mines can cover an area of many square kilometres and use very large pieces of equipment, such as draglines, power shovels, large trucks, bucket wheel excavators and conveyors.

## machinery used in coal mines
Dec 18 2020 0183 32 The early mines used the so-called room-and-pillar method a mining system in which the mined material is extracted across a horizontal plane creating horizontal arrays of rooms and pillars Mines relied on manual labor to cut the coal at the working face and the coal was hauled from the mine by horse and wagon

## Continuous miners | Introduction | underground COAL
A conveying system, usually a chain conveyor running in a steel trough from front to rear of the miner. A rear jib section capable of a degree of vertical and horizontal movement to enable the coal to be delivered into a transport or loaded at a desired point. Some continuous miners (at one time almost all) could not cut the full roadway width
