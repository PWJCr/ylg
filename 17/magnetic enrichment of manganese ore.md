##  Upgrading of Low-Grade Manganese Ore by Selective Reduction of Iron 
4-rich manganese ore displayed a ferromagnetic behavior. As a result, in order to remove iron from manganese ore by magnetic separation, the Mn 3O 4 in calcined manganese ore should be further converted to MnO. Otherwise, some of the manganese in the form of Mn 3O 4 may also be removed by magnetic separation, thus resulting in a loss of manganese.

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Influence of Mineralogy on the Dry Magnetic 
Jan 31, 2021Magnetic separation is often considered pertinent for manganese ore beneficiation when the ore is abundant with siliceous rich gangue mineral phases. However, the process is deemed to be inapposite for the ferruginous type of ore, and remains a grey area of research. In the present investigation, two different types of manganese ore were studied in detail to understand the influence of

## magnetic separation of manganese ore
As we know most manganese ore belongs to the lean ore,  re-election, high magnetic separation and flotation), and fire enrichment,  Manganese ore mining equipment for sale in China In the rough and a variety of new, fine magnetic machine were developed.
