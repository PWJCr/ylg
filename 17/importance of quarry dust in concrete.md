## What are the advantages of using quarry dust as fine aggregate in concrete?
Answer (1 of 5): The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarries. By replacement of quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem

Answer (1 of 4): I'm not an authority on this subject, but here are some thoughts. That depends upon what the quarry dust is. If it has minerals that will react with the cement you could get a faster or slower set time. Also, since quarry dust is quite fine, you should have a denser concrete. Hig

To over-come the difficulties due to excessive sand mining, quarry dust was used as fine aggregate. Quarry dust is the fine material, produced from gravel crushers. Super plasticizers were used to improve workability of concrete. Cement was replaced with 10% of silica fume. The M60 grade concrete used was designed by using a modified ACI method
