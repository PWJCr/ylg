## What Brought Conflict Between Mining Companies And Farmers
Does mining fall under agriculture? Mining occurs in the same geographic areas as agriculture. It competes for similar inputs like land water and labour. . In addition farming is for many the economic activity they have lived with the longest. But mining also brings in additional revenue that can greatly help farmers improve their outputs.

Environmental Impacts. Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from coal mines or metal mines, often abandoned mines where ore- or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing the sulphur-bearing mineral pyrite. Pyrite reacts with air and water to form sulphuric acid and dissolved iron, and as water washes through mines, this compound forms a dilute acid, which

The water pollution is caused by acid that drains from the "Iron Mountain" mine, known as acid drainage. Acid drainage is serious stuff. With a pH value of 0, the groundwater near the "Iron Mountain" has been found to be 10,000 times more acidic than battery acid (this is VERY acidic). It's the highest concentration of acid in the world.

Environmental effects of mining can occur at local, regional, and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices. The effects can result in erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, or the contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes. These processes also affect the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have an effect
