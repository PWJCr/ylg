## Lightweight Aggregates | Aggregate Industries
Lightweight aggregates. Our lightweight aggregates from Lytag® are made from fly ash generated by coal fired power stations. Our technology heats the fly ash to 1,100°C to create a hard pellet, with a honeycombed internal structure. Which can then be used as a superior, lightweight aggregate which is up to 50 lighter than natural aggregate.
