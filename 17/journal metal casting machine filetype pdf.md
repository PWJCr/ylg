## Casting Process: Definition, Working Process, Types in detail 
In addition to sand certain bonding agents are mixed like clay. More than 60% of metal casting is done using the sand casting method. Merits: Wider choice of material as any kind of metal alloy can be cast. The cost of tools & equipment needed to perform the process is certainly lower than other metal casting processes.

## Casting & its types in metals - SlideShare
Casting & its types in metals. 1. • Casting is the process of producing metal/alloy component parts of desired shapes by pouring the molten metal/alloy into a prepared mold (of that shape) and then allowing the metal/alloy to cool and solidify. The solidified piece of metal/alloy is known as a CASTING or FOUNDRY". 2.

##  Metal Casting Processes - 
Two Categories of Metal Casting Processes 1. Expendable mold processes - mold is sacrificed to remove part Advantage: more complex shapes possible Disadvantage: production rates often limited by time to make mold rather than casting itself 2. Permanent mold processes - mold is made of metal and can be used to make many castings

The mold is made from a refractory material, for example, sand. The metal is heated in an oven until it melts, and the molten metal is poured into the mould cavity.
