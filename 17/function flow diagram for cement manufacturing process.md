Summary. Flow coefficient, Cv, and Flow Factor, Kv, are values used to specify the hydraulic capacity of a control valve. Flow coefficient is an imperial measurement and is defined as: the flow of water through a valve at 60Â°F in US gallons/minute (gpm) at a pressure drop of 1lb/inÂ². Flow factor is the metric equivalent of flow coefficient.
