Use a high-grade aluminum oxide polish, about 1 tablespoon polish to 2-3 tablespoons of water, in a slurry. Add a small amount of vinegar to help stop scratches, though that's seldom a problem. Apply the polish to the lap with a decent-quality watercolor paintbrush made for applying washes. It will hold a good amount of liquid/polish.
