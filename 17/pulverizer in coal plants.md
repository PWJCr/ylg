## Why Pulverized Coal is Used in a Power Plant
Coal for Power Plants. The coal fired power plant converts energy in coal to electricity. The basic input into the system is the fuel that is coal. All other systems and equipment only aid in this conversion process. Before going into the details, let us look at the quantity of coal processed in a power plant.

## Pulverized coal-fired boiler
A pulverized coal-fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.. The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.

Often, we visit plants that perform pulverizer maintenance based on operating hours, or fuel tons throughput. In our view, pulverizer maintenance should be driven by periodic tests of pulverizer performance. The important elements of pulverizer performance are fineness, fuel distribution, coal (pyrites) rejects, and primary airflow calibrations.

Pulverized coal is the most efficient way of using coal in a steam generator. The coal is ground so that about 70 % will pass through 200 mesh (0.075 mm) and 99 % will pass through 50 mesh (0.300 mm). A pulverized coal boiler can be easily adapted for other fuels like gas if required later without much difficulty.
