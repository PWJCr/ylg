## What is fine grained rock texture? - Short-Question
What are examples of fine - grained rocks? Extrusive igneous rocks are formed when molten magma spill over to the surface as a result of volcanic eruption. The magma on the surface (lava) cools faster on the surface to form igneous rocks that are fine grained. Examples of such kind of rocks include pumice, basalt, or obsidian.

What is fine-grained rock called? Igneous rocks may be simply classified according to their chemical/mineral composition as felsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic, and by texture or grain size: intrusive rocks are course grained (all crystals are visible to the naked eye) while extrusive rocks may be fine-grained (microscopic crystals) or

Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro.

Fine-Grained (Aphanitic) Textures. Fine-grained textures generally indicate magmas that rapidly cooled at or near the Earth's surface. Fast cooling prevents crystals from growing very large. The cutoff between fine- and coarse-grained textures is about 1 mm. All four photos below are of the mafic rock basalt.

## Geology.docx - 1. Why are intrusive rocks coarse-grained
1. Why are intrusive rocks coarse-grained and extrusive rocks fine-grained? Fine grain vs coarse grained rocks depends on the cooling of the melt: slow cooling allows large crystals to form while fast cooling yields small crystals. Intrusive rocks are coarse-grained because they take longer to cool.

Classifications of fine-grained sediments and sedimentary rocks are based on combinations of several criteria. These include: (1) texture, (2) fissility, (3) tectonic association or environment of deposition, (4) mineral composition, (5) color, (6) chemical composition and (7) degree of metamorphism.

## Fine-grained rocks: Shales or physilites - ScienceDirect
Fine-grained sediments and rocks containing a high percentage of phyllosilicate minerals have never been satisfactorily classified. Rocks names are poorly defined.

## How do fine grained and coarse grained igneous rocks form differently

If magma is
