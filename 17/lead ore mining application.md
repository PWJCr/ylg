## Lead Ore Mining application
 6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations, though a few surface operations do exist.

and gold. The most common lead-ore mineral is galena, or lead sulfide (PbS). Another ore mineral in which lead is found combined with sulfur is anglesite or lead sulfate (PbSO4). Cerussite (PbCO3) is a mineral that is a carbonate of lead. All three of these ores are found in the United States, which is one of the chief lead-mining countries.
