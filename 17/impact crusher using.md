## Impact Crushers - Powerscreen
Impact crushers (also known as impactors or horizontal shaft impactors) can be used in primary, secondary, or tertiary applications. They use inertia of the blowbars fitted to the rotor to fracture the material, resulting in a high reduction ratio. Impactors are often used as a cost effective alternative to jaw and cone combination plants as

## Impact Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The three types of crushers most commonly used for crushing CDW materials are the jaw crusher, the impact crusher and the gyratory crusher (Figure 4.4).A jaw crusher consists of two plates, with one oscillating back and forth against the other at a fixed angle (Figure 4.4(a)) and it is the most widely used in primary crushing stages (Behera et al., 2014).
