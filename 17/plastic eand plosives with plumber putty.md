## Plastic tub: do I use plumber's putty or silicone? : r/Plumbing - reddit
I'm installing the drain on a plastic-covered fiberglass tub. The plumber's putty instructions say, in big bold letters, not to use it on plastic and to use a silicone sealant instead. But I've also seen many plumbers (admittedly YouTube plumbers) caution not to use silicone in bathtub drains because it will always break down in standing water.

## Should I use the gasket that came with the kitchen faucet or plumber's 
Plumber's putty is a very inexpensive commodity contained in short plastic containers. It is often manually formed before the plumbing component is added. Take these basic moves to add the putty of plumber: Roll the putty between open palms to build an ongoing chain (like creating a hydra out of Play-Doh).
