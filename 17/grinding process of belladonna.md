With the in-feed method, the regulating wheel spins the part at one speed while pushing it towards the grinding wheel, which is spinning at a faster speed. The greater the difference in speeds, the faster the removal rate. 4. The choice of grinding wheel is critical. Another key factor in centerless grinding is the choice of grinding wheel.

A surface Grinding Machine is a machine in which a grinding wheel is used as a cutting tool for removing the material from the surface of the workpiece. It is also called an abrasive machining process where abrasives are placed on the surface and corners of the grinding wheel so as to do the finishing process with much more accuracy.

The basic purpose of grinding coffee beans is to facilitate the extraction process by exposing more surface area to the hot water. Basically, the process of making coffee happens as roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with hot water that 'extracts' the flavour, ideally resulting in a delicious cup of brew.

Centerless grinding is the process of removing material from the outside diameter of a work piece using an abrasive wheel. In its simplest form, a centerless grinder consists of the machine base, grinding wheel, regulating wheel and work blade. With centerless grinding, the work piece is not mechanically held to drive the part.
