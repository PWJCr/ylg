Grinding machine is a strong machining tool that scrapes a work piece utilizing an abrasive/grinding wheel. Abrasive wheel cover has small rough bits, which in contact with the work piece apply sheer energy that causes shear deformation. In plain terms, it alters the shape of a work piece by cutting its tiny chips.

A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.
