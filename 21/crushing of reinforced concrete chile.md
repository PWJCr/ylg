The diagonal cracking is also found to begin. Subsequently, unconfined concrete crushing occurs at both ends of columns, whereas reinforcing steel yielding occurs on both ends of the beam. Then, diagonal cracking is completely achieved. In the final stage, confined concrete crushing is found to occur only at the bottom of both columns.

## Performance of reinforced concrete buildings during the 27 February 
The paper presents observed damage in reinforced concrete buildings during the 27 February 2010 Maule earthquake in Chile. Performance of concrete frame and shear wall buildings are discussed with emphasis on seismic deficiencies in design and construction practices. It is shown that the majority of structural damage in multistorey and high-rise buildings can be attributed to poor performance

## Web Crushing Of Reinforced Concrete Structural Walls
Shear Strength of Reinforced Concrete Walls Subjected to . The web-crushing strength of a wall is calculated as V wc max = 1 8f c 1 + 600 −2000 N u A gf c δ b w(0 8l w) (3) where δ is the story drift ratio to which the wall is subjected For walls with high axial loads when N u/A gf c ≥ 0 09 the web crushing strength may not exceed V .
