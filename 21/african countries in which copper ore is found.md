## African Iron Age - 1,000 Years of African Kingdoms - ThoughtCo
The African Iron Age is traditionally marked as between about 200 BCE-1000 CE. African communities may or may not have independently invented a process to work iron, but they were enormously innovative in their techniques. The earliest iron artifacts in the world were beads made by the Egyptians about 5,000 years ago.

## 2. Africa in world mining geography - United Nations University
Africa's significance as an iron ore producer is, of course, reduced by the fact of these widely dispersed resources. In 1974, on the eve of the world crisis, Africa's share (excluding South Africa) of world mineral output was 7.5% for iron ore, 17% for copper, 10% for bauxite and (including South Africa) 23% for uranium.

In most cases, the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3-8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6-40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15-90 days duration for copper oxides and 10-18 months for sulfides. Of note, 80%-85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.

## How much copper has been found in the world? - USGS
To date, roughly 700 million metric tons of copper have been produced around the world. This would fit into a cube measuring about 430 meters on a side. Identified deposits contain an estimated 2.1 billion metric tons of additional copper, which brings the total amount of discovered copper to 2.8 billion metric tons. This would fit into a cube measuring 680 meters on a side.

## Geology of Copper | Properties, Mining, and Formation of Copper
1 day agoHow Copper is Mined. Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.

## South Africa - Resources and power | Britannica
South Africa is rich in a variety of minerals. In addition to diamonds and gold, the country also contains reserves of iron ore, platinum, manganese, chromium, copper, uranium, silver, beryllium, and titanium. No commercially exploitable deposits of petroleum have been found, but there are moderate quantities of natural gas located off the southern coast, and synthetic fuel is made from coal

## Top 5 African Countries that are Mining Lithium - Business Elites Africa
Several African countries have large lithium deposits, with numerous hard-rock projects that might lead to lithium extraction.  Since 1910, when tin was found, the Bikita pegmatite has been mined regularly, while the petalite for lithium mining began in the 1940s. The standard method of extraction of lithium ore is the hard-rock extraction

## Copper in Africa
Copper is one of the world's most important industrial minerals, and Africa is an important world producer. While output is traditionally dominated by Zambia, South Africa and Katanga Province in the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, many African nations contribute to copper production, and many African nations have undeveloped ore resources.

## Africa: Minerals and Mining - Geography
But few African countries—and few Africans—receive the benefits of these resources. The lack of technology and investment money have limited mining operations, and not all countries have significant resources.  Surveyors in South Africa had found astonishing sources of copper in 1854, diamonds in 1867, and gold in the 1880s
