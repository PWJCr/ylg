Treatment of 8-10 mm UPJ stones: When it comes to UPJ kidney stones, an 8-10 mm stone is a fairly large stone as far as stone size goes. It is very rare that a patient will pass an 8-10 mm stone spontaneously, especially if it is at the UPJ (uretero-pelvic junction) which is at the start of the passage of kidney stones from the kidney to the urinary bladder.

## Density of Aggregate - Bulk and Relative Density - Civil Engineering
The relative density (specific gravity) of an aggregate is the ratio of its mass to the mass of an equal volume of water. Relative Density = Mass of the Aggregate / Mass of equal volume of water. Key Features: Most aggregates have a relative density between 2.4-2.9 with a corresponding particle (mass) density of kg/m 3 ( lb/ft 3).
