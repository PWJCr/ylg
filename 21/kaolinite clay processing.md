## Using Kaolin Clay in Soap - Countryside
Kaolin clay in soap can absorb both oil and water, and many use it as a soap additive for fixing scent, gentle skin polishing or just to improve the opacity and whiteness of a soap. Kaolin clay is a fine textured, highly absorbent mineral compound mined in locations all over the world. About 50 percent of the kaolin produced is used in the

## Production Process - kaolin
Firing is the most important manufacturing process stage, because, when the semi-hardened elements travel through the kiln, they undergo fundamental transformations in their physico-chemical properties. The processed pieces are subjected to a high-temperature thermal cycle up to 1300 C. The length of the kiln can be more than hundreds of meters.

Dry process is a simple and economical processing technology. After the mined raw ore is crushed to 25.4mm by the hammer crusher, it is fed into the cage crusher to reduce the particle size to 6.35mm. The hot air in the cage crusher reduces the moisture of the kaolin from 20% to 10% or so. The crushed ore is further ground by an air-blown

## Does kaolinite react with acid?m.youramys
Kaolinite is formed by weathering or hydrothermal alteration of aluminosilicate minerals. Thus, rocks rich in feldspar commonly weather to kaolinite.  Kaolinite, because it does not absorb water, does not expand when it comes in contact with water. Thus, kaolinite is the preferred type of clay for the ceramic industry.

Kaolin is a clay mineral, part of the group of industrial minerals with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5 (OH)4. It is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet of silica (SiO4) linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina (AlO6) octahedra. Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin or china clay.

## Kaolinite Properties, Occurrence and Uses Area - Geology Science
Kaolinite is a clay mineral with chemical composition Al2Si2O5 (OH)4. It is an important industrial mineral. Rocks rich in kaolinite are called kaolin. Kaolinite, common group of clay minerals that are hydrated aluminum silicates; they contain the main components of kaolin (china clay). The group includes kaolinite, which is chemically similar
