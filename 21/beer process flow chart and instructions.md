## Coopers - The Brewing Process
Fermentation. Yeast is added for fermentation to begin. The yeast uses the sugars in the wort to create alcohol and carbon dioxide. Our famous Coopers beer flavours then begin to develop. At Coopers, we brew ales, stouts and lagers and while each style of beer is produced differently, our passion for quality brewing shines in all. Or. Near Me.
