Once PLS is leached, it is sent to a solvent extraction plant to remove the copper. The PLS is mixed with an organic solvent that binds to the copper and chemically separates the copper from the rest of the liquid. Then, the copper-bearing liquid is combined with another acid to precipitate the copper from the organic material.

Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulphate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.

The copper concentrate is first sent through the smelting furnace to be heated up to 2,300 Â°F and converted into molten liquid. The heated liquid is poured into a slag-settling furnace. This step produces a combination of matte, a mixture of copper, sulfur and iron, and slag, a dense, glassy material made of iron, silica, and other impurities.

4.3 Roasting of Copper Concentrate. One of the drawbacks of matte smelting is the production of large quantities of SO 2 that must be disposed of. One way to avoid this is to roast copper concentrate in the presence of lime or limestone, which captures the sulfur as CaS or CaSO 4. The aim is to produce metallic copper as one of the products

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

## Copper for crop production | UMN Extension
Copper (Cu) is one of eight essential plant micronutrients. Copper is required for many enzymatic activities in plants and for chlorophyll and seed production. Deficiency of copper can lead to increased susceptibility to diseases like ergot, which can cause significant yield loss in small grains. Most Minnesota soils supply adequate amounts of copper for crop production. However, copper

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market..

The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.
