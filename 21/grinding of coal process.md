## Coal grinding to obtain water-coal fuel
Coal grinding mills. In conventional systems, coal grinding is carried out using ball and rod mills. Depending on the process flow diagram and the type of coal mill, the specific power consumption is very high and ranges on the average from 50 to 250 kW·h/t. Such energy input arises due to a very low energy efficiency of the equipment used.
