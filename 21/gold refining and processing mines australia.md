## Is Gold Turning Green? | Wood Mackenzie
23 June 2021. 1 minute read. Based on its scale, gold mining could be considered relatively inconsequential in terms of total global greenhouse gas emissions. But the industry cannot afford to be complacent. Scrutiny of the environmental impact of mining has never been greater and with COP26 on the horizon the spotlight will only intensify.

What exactly is gold mining? By exact definition gold mining is the mining resource that extracts gold. For centuries and decades there has been innovations in the way that gold has been mined and processed. Mining for gold in modern times is an intense but sophisticated method. According to experts most surface gold or alluvial gold has been discovered, leading to the fact that nowadays gold

For every ounce of gold produced in 2020, gold miners pocketed $828 on average, significantly higher than the previous high of $666/oz set in 2011. With inflation rates hitting decade-highs in several countries, gold mining could be a sector to watch, especially given gold's status as a traditional inflation hedge.

Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.

## Historical mercury losses from the gold mines of Victoria, Australia 
The historical gold mining industry offered a rich market for mercury but many years of prospecting, mine development and cinnabar processing yielded very limited output. Global mercury demand in the 19th century could be met with a few very large deposits, worked by cheap labour and controlled by a small number of producers.

The result of this process is 99.5 percent pure gold. The final step is to cast the gold into electrodes or anodes and place them in an electrolytic cell. The refiners will then pass an electric current through the cell. At the end of this process, the gold will be 99.99 percent pure. Reclaiming the Mine; No gold mine lasts forever.

The refining procedure is then completed by placing the ingots (anodes) in vats containing a nitric acid solution and applying an electric charge. The ingot dissolves and the silver content is plated out on a cathode plate. The resulting silver crystal is removed from the cell, washed, dried, and melted into the desired shape as pure silver.
