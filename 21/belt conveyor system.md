## Basics of Belt Conveyor Systems - Martin Eng
Use steel flat pulleys as opposed to winged pulleys. Load when the belt is fully troughed. Make sure the belt is tensioned properly. Be sure all rolling components are clean, rolling, and aligned. When a vulcanized splice can't be used, skive mechanical splices. Belting specifications should be made according to system design and production
