## Everything You Need To Know About Recycled Crushed Concrete
Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

## What Is Crushed Concrete? - Modern Design
Crushed Concrete aggregate can be used instead of stones to create a walkway or pathway. Use a smaller aggregate because it'll be easier to walk on. I usually spread about 2-3 inches evenly over some landscaping felt. The felt is important because it helps prevent weeds from growing.

Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete.

What is Recycled Concrete Aggregate? Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) — also called "crushed concrete" — is made up of asphalt debris from other construction projects that can be reused to create driveways, pathways, garden beds and more.. When any concrete structure, road, sidewalk or parking lot is destroyed, that concrete is often deposited in a landfill.
