## What are minerals and What are economically important minerals?
A mineral is a chemical compound that has a precise chemical composition and is unstable and solid. It is a naturally occurring compound. It is unstable and the internal structure is ordered. Mineralogy is the study of minerals. Diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires produced in the industry are similar to gems, so they are called man-made minerals.

## Metallic Deposits - CliffsNotes
Metallic Deposits. Metals occur in all kinds of rocks but usually in concentrations that are too low to be mined. Metallic ore deposits, however, are relatively rare concentrations of metal‐bearing minerals (usually sulfides) that contain enough metal to be profitably mined. Again, the profit line is dependent on a number of economic factors.
