## A study of the chemical effect of marble and granite slurry on green 
Shehdeh ( 2016) observed that substitution of 10% of sand by weight with granite powder in concrete resulted in a maximum increase in compressive strength to approximately 500 kg/cm 2 compared to 365 kg/cm 2 of control concrete and an increase in splitting tensile strength to 30 kg/cm 2 compared to 26 kg/cm 2 of control concrete.

Estimating compressive strength. General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis, so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0. C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities, but many

## Silestone dekton-muenchen
The Silestone brand is owned by the. Marble countertops vs silestone . Comments (2) Pick a marble slab or quartz slab that's a bit more forgiving with color variations and stay away from white to help hide possible stains and water spots. Unfortunately quartz material such as silestone will have the same effect.

## Granite | Density, Heat Capacity, Thermal Conductivity
The Young's modulus of elasticity is the elastic modulus for tensile and compressive stress in the linear elasticity regime of a uniaxial deformation and is usually assessed by tensile tests. See also: Strength of Materials. Ultimate Tensile Strength of Granite. Ultimate tensile strength of Granite is 4.8 MPa. Yield Strength of Granite
