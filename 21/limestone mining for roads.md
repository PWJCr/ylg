## Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical Sedimentary Rock - Geology
Therefore, limestone quarries can be large and long lived, mining limestone layers that can be hundreds of feet thick over areas of several square miles. Many quarries produce multiple products, and crushed rocks that are not pure enough for certain uses may still be suitable as road aggregate. Marble quarries can also be very large.

## CDC - Mining - Characteristics of Dust from Unpaved Mine Haulage Roads 
Mining Publication: Characteristics of Fugitive Dust Generated from Unpaved Mine Haulage Roads. Fugitive dust is generated along unpaved mine roads from intermittent equipment traffic. Typically, the majority of such traffic consists of trucks hauling either mine product or waste from the surface mine pit and/or the processing plant.
