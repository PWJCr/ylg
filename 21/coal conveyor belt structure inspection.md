## Quality standards and testing in the conveyor belt industry
The wear-resistance quality of a conveyor belt is usually the single most important factor that will determine its operational lifetime and consequently its cost-effectiveness.  This is especially true when it comes to conveying coal. Even the strongest, heaviest belts can be punctured and ripped by a foreign object becoming trapped

## Belt Inspection - National Robotics Engineering Center - Carnegie 
In underground mines, conveyor belt systems move coal and other materials. A typical coal mine may have as many as 20 conveyor belts, some of which may be as long as 20,000 feet. A conveyor belt is typically made from a rubber/fabric laminate, and it is assembled by fastening together several belt sections, end-to-end, to form a continuous system.

stainless marine exhaust manifolds for sale A steel flexible wire is set below the running conveyor belt approx 20-30mm attached by a rare earth magnet at each end. If the belt is ripped or damaged the wire is pulled away releasing the magnet connection which in turn will activate a switch.  The sensors can be connected directly to a PLC input, or for greater safety, to a central.

## Belt Tear Detection for Coal Mining Conveyors - Semantic Scholar
The belt conveyor is the most commonly used conveying equipment in the coal mining industry. As the core part of the conveyor, the belt is vulnerable to various failures, such as scratches, cracks, wear and tear. Inspection and defect detection is essential for conveyor belts, both in academic research and industrial applications. In this paper, we discuss existing techniques used in
