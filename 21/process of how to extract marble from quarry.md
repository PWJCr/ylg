## Quarry
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.). There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types ( mines and caves). For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries. In the 18th century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was

Marble is currently being obtained from open cast quarries such as Crema Marfil Coto. But also from underground quarries. Extraction methods and the resulting marble block sizes will depend on the quarry in question. Marble quarrying is usually done in vertical cuts. However, there are also cases where it is also done in horizontal cuts.

The oldest technique was the "tagliata": the quarrymen, through the use of chisels, created cracks in the rock, especially where they found pre-existing cracks or chinks, obtaining a V cutting line. Then the crack was forced with metal elements (iron wedges), in order to obtain a deep one that caused the separation of the marble bench wall.
