This means that the larger the carat, the heavier the diamond will be. How to determine carat size. One carat is equal to 0.2 grams, and one diamond carat is divided into 100 points, meaning that 0.25 of a carat is 25 points or ¼ carat.The size dimension of a diamond for its weight is a good indicator of its value and desirability. 40-Carat Diamond. $8,366,500.
