## Smelting palladiumlle.fr
Smelting is taking ore either oxide, sulphide, etc and making metal from it. Your description does not sound like smelting .  Platinum is highly reactivewhich is why it's used with palladium in cats in the first place--so getting it back out of the soup aint easy. Nothing wrong with experimenting but don't bet the farm on the results.

## What does iron smelters meaning?d.il
How is iron smelting done? Smelting involves heating up ore until the metal becomes spongy and the chemical compounds in the ore begin to break down.  Carbon and carbon monoxide combine with the oxygen in the iron ore and carry it away, leaving iron metal. In a bloomery, the fire doesn't get hot enough to melt the iron completely.

## Iron Making: Smelting (U.S. National Park Service)
Bog ore is an iron-rich sedimentary rock that was harvested locally from bogs and similar bodies of water. It was also found in fields and meadows that used to be bogs. Bog ore is often considerably less than 50% iron. The rest of the rock was made up of impurities that the workers had to remove. Gabbro was used as a flux;a way to purify the ore.

## Africa's largest steel plant under construction in Zimbabwe
Dec 15, 2021The Mvuma Steel Plants will be split into two locations, one in Midlands for iron ore smelting and the other in Chikomba, Mashonaland East, for the majority of the mining and beneficiation. The facility is intended to employ 5,000 people and will be three times the defunct ZISCO Steel, formerly the continent's largest.
