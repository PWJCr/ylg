## Use Range and Attentions of Gyratory Crusher - Luoyang Dahua
The gyratory crusher is a large crusher which makes use of the gyratory movement of the crushing cone in the inner cone cavity to extrude, split and bend the material for various kinds of rocks and stones. Gyratory crusher is a typical coarse crushing equipment in a large mineral dressing plant. Both gyratory crusher and jaw crusher can be used as coarse crushing machinery.

## Cone crusher, Cone crushing and screening plant - All industrial 
A cone crusher is used to break blocks of mineral matter into smaller pieces of a desired size. The material is crushed between an eccentrically rotating cone and a concave hopper, both reinforced with a wear-resistant surface. Material introduced from above wedges between the cone and hopper surfaces and is crushed.

Gyratory crusher. A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher, consisting of a concave surface and a conical head with both the surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel liners. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but it does not rotate. The movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement.

"Rotary" crushers exploiting "gyration", are significantly developed due to their larger capacity compared to jaw crushers. This type of crusher consists of a concave surface and a conical head with the outer shell being pointed downward and the inner cone standing upward. The outer shell is fixed while the inner cone rotates.
