## Indiana Limestone - Generation Stoneworks
Known as "The Nation's Building Stone," Indiana Limestone is a sedimentary stone formed more than 300 million years ago. Its consistent color and grades, along with workability, make it premier choice for many monuments and buildings since the early 19th century. Indiana Limestone quarries have been in operation since the mid 1800's.
