## Quartz | Common Minerals
Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.

Notes:1. Sand in lime mortar is an adulterant, and reduces its shrinkage. Lime mortar becomes porous allowing air to penetrate and helps the mortar in hardening. 2. Lime mortar is not suitable for water-logged areas and damp situations. Lime mortars have plasticity and placability, good cohesion with other surfacings and little shrinkage.

The garnet mineral almandine is harder than quartz (Mohs 7.5), but its real virtue is its sharpness, giving it cutting power without scratching wood too deeply. Corundum is the workhorse abrasive of sandpaper. Extremely hard (Mohs 9) and sharp, corundum is also usefully brittle, breaking into sharp fragments that keep on cutting.

Abrasive Grain Processing - Abrasive grains for both bonded and coated abrasive products are made by graded crushing and close sizing of either natural or synthetic abrasives. Raw abrasive materials first are crushed by primary crushers and are then reduced by jaw crushers to manageable size, approximately 19 millimeters (mm) (0.75 inches [in]).

A grinding wheel is a precision tool with thousands of cutting points on its surface - abrasive grains that are held in place by a bond matrix (hence these are known as bonded abrasives) and separated by pores.. These pores are hollow spaces between abrasive grains and the bond, which help with the clearance of discarded metal chips in the grinding process.

Quartzite (from German Quarzit) forms when quartz sandstones are metamorphosed. The term quartzite also implies its high quartz content. Most quartzites contain 90% quartz by volume, but the percentage can go up to 99% in the case of the purest quartzite forms. Quartzite looks similar to its parent rock but it is much harder than sandstone.

When a sufficiently hard abrasive particle strikes steel, it deforms the surface into a valley and pushes up peaks. The distance between the top of the peak and the bottom of the valley is known as the depth profile. In the U.S., the depth profile is measured by mils - thousandths of an inch.In the metric system, the micron(one millionth of a meter) is used.
