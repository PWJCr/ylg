## PRIME PubMed | Limestone dosage response of cadmium phytoavailability 
We conducted batch sorption and greenhouse experiments to investigate optimal conditions of pH and amorphous manganese content (Mnox) in limestone treated-soil for suppressing the Cd uptake by rice plants. The adsorption/desorption behavior of Cd in a soil/limestone mixture was dominated by the composition and density of sorption sites

A variety of Manganese Oxides Black dendritic films of various visually indistinguishable black manganese oxides, may consist of birnessite, coronadite, cryptomelane, hollandite, romanèchite, todorokite or other species. Many manganese minerals have similar strong X-ray powder diffraction lines and line-broadening can make X-ray diffraction identification ineffectual.

## Production of Ferro- Manganese - IspatGuru
Ferro-manganese (Fe-Mn) is an important additive used as a deoxidizer in the production of steel. It is a master alloy of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) with a minimum Mn content of 65 %, and maximum Mn content of 95 %. It is produced by heating a mixture of the oxides of Mn (MnO2) and iron (Fe2O3) with carbon (C) normally as coke or coal.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
