## The Most Practical Jaw Crusher Repair and Maintenance Manual
The lubrication of the interface between the parts of the jaw crusher is very important. It can minimize the friction generated during the operation, make the whole jaw crusher run smoothly, and extend its service life. Unlike gyratory crushers, the main lubrication used in jaw crushers is grease instead of oil. When using grease, there may be
