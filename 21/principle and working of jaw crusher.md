Although the structure of the jaw crusher is different, its working principle is the same, that is, the material is crushed by the periodic reciprocating motion of the movable jaw. In the process of swinging the movable jaw to the fixed jaw around the suspension mandrel, the material between the two jaw plates will be crushed, split and bent.
