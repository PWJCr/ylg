## How does a copper smelter work?e.rescrf
How does the smelting process work? Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy to produce a metal from its ore. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind.The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, charcoal, and coal.
