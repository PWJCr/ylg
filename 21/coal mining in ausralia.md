In contrast to most global production, the majority (around 75%) of black coal in Australia is produced from open-cut mines.

## Mining in Australia: Is there a future for coal? - Minedex
The future of coal in Australia. Global demand for coal is growing as energy demand is expected to increase between now and 2030. While some of this energy will be generated from renewables, for the immediate future the need to ensure a reliable supply of energy means that energy is far more likely to come from a proven source, like coal.
