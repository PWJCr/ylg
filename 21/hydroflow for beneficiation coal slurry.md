## Beneficiation of an Indian non-coking coal by column flotation
Beneficiation of non-coking coal is gaining ground in India. It not only reduces the volume of inert content to be transported to the power plant and also lowers the wear in the boiler houses. For special applications such as the fuel for integrated gasification combined cycle plant (IGCC), the ash content in the coal should preferably be below 15 %. Indian coals are characterized by high
