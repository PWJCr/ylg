## How Are Granite and Marble Countertops Made? | Marble
Polishers grind down the naturally rough surface of the stone to whatever finish the consumer desires. Hard stones like marble and granite can be polished all the way to a mirror finish. The polisher consists of rotating pads which are surfaced with an abrasive substance. The finer and smaller the abrasive grits are, the higher the polish.

## production process of granite
The process for granite headstones begins with factory workers first cutting down to size the large blocks of stone that come from granite quarries. After the stone is cut to the appropriate size, for example - 12" x 24" x 4" thick, it is polished as desired (usually just the top face for flat or flush markers).

Manufacturing is the production of a product by processing raw materials. This is accomplished through human labor, the use of machinery and/or other tools and often a biological or chemical process. Manufacturing can be on a large scale, or it can make the pieces that are assembled to build automobiles, airplanes, household appliances and more.
