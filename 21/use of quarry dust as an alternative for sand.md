## Introduction to Quarry-Dust as Partial Replacement Material to  - IJERT
This review study has tried to focus on the incorporation of quarry dust in different ways which has given good and satisfactory results, proved economical to use and also become a low cost alternative material which can be partially replaced with the scarce material i.e cement and sand.

The Udden-Wentworth scale categorizes gravel into either granule with 2mm to 4 mm (0.079-0.157 inches) particle sizes or pebbles with 4mm to 64 mm (0.2-2.5 inches) particles. Granule gravel is sub-divided into very fine and fine, while pebble gravel has three sub-categories, i.e., medium, coarse, and very coarse.

## quarry dust as alternative to sand
Quarry dust is an upcoming alternative for the replacement of sand. Quarry dust according to the global research can effectively replace 50-60% of sand in conventional concrete. Thus the entire purpose of the study was to experimentally determine the feasibility of use of quarry dust in replacement of sand in conventional concrete.

Quarry dust a by- product from crushing process during quarrying activities is good alternative during construction projects. It is used as substitute to sand to make quarry dust concrete which is believed to be stronger and more durable than the regular concrete materials. Uses of Quarry Dust. It can be used as substitute to sand wholly or partly.

## Can we make concrete using quarry dust as a replacement for sand 
Answer (1 of 8): Of course. Quite a standard procedure. We call it crusher dust, or manufactured sand. Dependent on the source rock and type of crusher, the particle shape is unlikely to be nice round grains, which makes for concrete that is not quite as nice to play with, but it is still far fr

Ideally what you want to have is a wide range of aggragate sizes for the best concrete, with a good variation in sizes from small to large. It seems to me that if you took the quarry dust and mixed it towther with a latex fortifier and portland cement you could make a good thinset mortar, which would be better suited for thinner applications and small cracks and joints.

## Feasibility of Quarry Dust to Replace River Sand as Fine  - SLJOL
Use of substitutions like offshore sand in particular to replace river sand is on the rise. Quarry dust is another alternative for river sand. However, full replacement of river sand with quarry dust is viewed with scepticism. Possible loss of workability and increase shrinkage is sighted against use of quarry dust as fine aggregate in concrete.

Add 1 inch of Granite Dust. Next I add up to 1″ of Granite Dust which I rake across the surface of the Type 1 and then compact several times with a Wacker Plate. The more times you Wacker the Granite Dust the less chance there will be of sinkage in the lawn as the air gaps in the dust can potentially fill with water.

Using quarry dust is environmentally friendly and available. Quarry dust is much more accessible and available than regular sand for construction. Regular sand is mined from the river bed but quarry dust is a by-product of stone chippings and a good replacement for sand. Using quarry dust saves the environment by preventing sand mining.
