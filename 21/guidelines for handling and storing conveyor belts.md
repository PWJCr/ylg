## Conveyors | Storage & Handling
Non-powered roller conveyors or Gravity Conveyors are the most economical and common method of conveying unit loads. The conveyors are typically mounted on a slight decline angle, therefore using gravity to assist product movement, especially for long distances. They can also be used in applications where the conveyor is level and operators can

The belt conveyor's role in bulk material handling systems. Designed for continuous operation, a belt conveyor can be used in a wide range of capacities and distances, and its length can be a few meters or tens of kilometers. At either end of the conveyor, the belt wraps around a pulley. This is the most common belt conveyor design.
