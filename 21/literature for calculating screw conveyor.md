Screw Conveyor for Coconut Handling The flow rate or capacity of a screw conveyor is measured in cubic feet per hour. If the capacity is given in pounds per hour, tons per hour, or bushels per hour, it is converted to cubic feet per hour. Since screw conveyors are controlled feed at the entrance, the cross channel load is less than 100 percent.
