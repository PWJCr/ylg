## Patriot® Cone Crusher | Secondary or Tertiary Crusher | Superior Industries
GUARANTEED FOR REAL LIFE. Typically applied in secondary and tertiary stages, the cone crusher produces reduction ratios of 6:1 to 4:1. Bushing cones, like Superior's Patriot Cone Crusher, consist of a rotating mantle inside a steel bowl. As rock is compressed between the mantle and the bowl, the force generated fractures the material.
