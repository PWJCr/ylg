As with crusher run, blinding materials contain a mix of sizes, from the maximum size that the screen mesh can pass, down to dust. Blinding, because it is finer than crusher run, is used for final shaping up of construction sub bases, particularly in road construction, where the sub base is the last unbound layer before coated materials are laid.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
