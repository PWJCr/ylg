Cement is traditionally made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with small amounts of other materials (such as clay) to 1450°C in a kiln. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'Ordinary Portland Cement', the most commonly used type of cement.

## Difference Between Gypsum and Limestone
The key difference between gypsum and limestone is that the calcium sulfate is the main constituent in gypsum whereas calcium carbonate is the main constituent of limestone.. Limestone and gypsum are minerals that form from calcium salts; limestone contains calcium carbonate while gypsum contains CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O. However, their properties and usages are different from each other.

## How is concrete made from limestone? | Shelly Company
To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

## Cement Types
In the most general sense, portland cement is produced by heating sources of lime, iron, silica, and alumina to clinkering temperature (2,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a rotating kiln, then grinding the clinker to a fine powder.  (i.e. grinding and possible blending with gypsum, limestone, or supplementary cementing materials), that

## Gypsum Content - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Depending on the tricalcium aluminate and gypsum content of ordinary portland cement, the maximum ettringite content of the hydrated product at early ages is approximately 15%; cementing systems containing industrial by-products, such as fly ash, with lime and gypsum may have a higher ettringite content of, for instance, 20% (Solem and McCarthy

## COMPARING AGRICULTURAL GYPSUM WITH LIMESTONE AND DOLOMITE (part 1)
By Brent Rouppet, Ph.D. There are two key soil amendments in agriculture: (1) gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate [CaSO4 H2O]), and (2) liming materials such as limestone (CaCO3) and, dolomite ( (CaMg (CO3)2). Liming materials are applied to neutralize soil acidity, but in situations where Ca is required without the need for correcting soil
