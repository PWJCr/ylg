## Relationship between modulus of subgrade reaction & bearing  - Bentley
On the other hand, the safe bearing capacity is the maximum pressure which the soil can carry safely without risk of shear failure. The unit for bearing capacity is KN/m2, whereas the unit for Subgrade modulus is kN/m3. As per Joseph Bowles the modulus of subgrade reaction is a conceptual relationship between soil pressure and deflection.

As nouns the difference between embankment and subgrade is that embankment is a long artificial mound of earth and stone, built to hold back water, for protection or to support a road while subgrade is the layer of native soil on which the foundation of a road is laid.

## Bases and Subbases for Concrete Pavement Performance
The material quality requirements of strength, plasticity, and gradation for subbase are not as strict as for a base. The subbase course must be better quality than the soil subgrade, the subbase is often omitted if soil subgrades are of high quality. Depending on site conditions, subgrade improvements may also be performed.

Certainly there are plenty of other considerations on a stamped concrete project, but these eight in particular always make the top of my list. 1.

## The Importance of Proper Base and Subgrade in Parking Lots
The aggregate base - or subbase - refers to those materials that lie directly below the asphalt surface. This base course is constructed using aggregate - granular materials. This is most likely stone or gravel and is compacted to ensure a solid foundation. In fact, 80-90% of the strength of a road or parking lot is provided by the aggregate base.

## In construction what is a subbase? - Dixie Sewing
What is difference between subgrade and subbase? A subgrade is made up of native soil that has been compacted to withstand the loads above it.  There is no consistency in regards to the terms of subbase and subgrade, but normally the subgrade is the native soil while the subbase is the layer of soil or aggregate on top of the subgrade.

Answer (1 of 2): The difference is in the quality and size of materials. Base is high quality stone aggregates, CBR is around 100%. It is meant to absorb the load from the bituminous layers and support them in staying intact. Poor strength of base will result in settlement of bituminous layers. T

## Differences Between Concrete and Asphalt Pavement - ACPA
Base and subbase courses are usually gravel or stone. These layers rest upon a compacted subgrade (compacted soil).  pavements are made up of portland cement concrete and may or may not have a base course between the pavement and subgrade. The essential difference between the two types of pavements, flexible and rigid, is the manner in which

## difference between subbase and subgrade
The primary structural difference between a rigid and flexible pavement is the manner in which each type of pavement distributes traffic loads over the subgrade. A rigid pavement has a very high stiffness and distributes loads over a relatively wide area of subgrade - a major portion of the structural capacity is contributed by the slab itself.

Concrete slabs are also the most efficient for hydronic radiant heating systems, as the thermal mass of the slab helps hold heat. Concrete slab floors do require that all subgrade utility rough ins be completed before the slab is poured and be accurately located. Retrofits for plumbing or mechanical changes later can be difficult and costly.

## Subgrades and Subbases for Slabs - Concrete Construction
On top of the subgrade, for most industrial slabs, a subbase is placed. Although the subbase is not mandatory, it serves as a work platform for construction of the slab and a cushion for more uniform support of the slab. Most road base material approved by the local DOT is suitable for the subbase.

A sub-base works by distributing a point load over a larger area. The interlock between adjacent particles of the sub-base material ensures that a relatively thin layer of the right sort of crushed aggregate can dramatically improve the ability of the ground to carry comparatively heavy loads.

In highway engineering, subbase is the layer of aggregate material laid on the subgrade, on which the base course layer is located. It may be omitted when there will be only foot traffic on the pavement, but it is necessary for surfaces used by vehicles. Subbase is often the main load-bearing layer of the pavement.
