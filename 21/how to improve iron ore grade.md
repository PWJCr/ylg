Apart from the DRI-Melter-BOF routes, various companies are developing fluidised bed reduction processes that can reduce iron ore using hydrogen rather than via fossil fuels. An advantage of such processes is their ability to use iron ore fines, eliminating the cost and energy used in iron ore pelletisation or agglomeration.
