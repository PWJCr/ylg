Two main factors ultimately led to the industrialisation of Germany: in 1834, 18 principalities founded the German Customs Union on the initiative of Prussia. This created an attractive sales market in a large part of Germany - and when the first train ran from Nuremberg to Fürth a year later, an efficient means of transport was also available.
