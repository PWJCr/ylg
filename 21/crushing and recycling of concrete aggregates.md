## Recycled Aggregate - CalRecycle Home Page
Recycled aggregate is produced by crushing concrete, and sometimes asphalt, to reclaim the aggregate. Recycled aggregate can be used for many purposes. The primary market is road base.  Setting up a new concrete and asphalt recycling plant requires certain State and local permits, such as air and water, and zoning.

## Concrete | Construction & Demolition Recycling Association
Concrete recycling is becoming an increasingly popular way to utilize aggregate left behind when structures or roadways are demolished. In the past, this rubble was disposed of in landfills, but with more attention being paid to environmental concerns, concrete recycling allows reuse of the rubble while also keeping construction costs down.
