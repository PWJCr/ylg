## where does sand and gravel come
Sand and gravel are naturally occurring, typically in pits, while crushed stone is a product of blasting, crushing and processing rock, typically in a quarry. Where does Sand and Gravel come from? Sand and gravel are found in certain geological settings around Texas.

## Why do I Have Sand in My Toilet Tank - Home Zesty
Typically renters find sand in their toilet tanks because of the city source. When repair crews do maintenance, they open up pipes. Resultantly, a little sand can get into the works. Naturally, that sand has to go somewhere. As the water moves around, it picks up whatever is in the pipes.

The word sand is thought to have originated from an Old English word which itself originated from the old Dutch word sant which became zand (meaning you guessed it sand). .

## Sand
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size. Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.. The composition of sand varies, depending on the

## Different Types of Sand and What They Should be Used for
Before we get into exactly what types of sand there are and how each should be used, it would be a good idea to find out what sand actually is and where it comes from. Sand is essentially made from rocks that have been broken up and eroded over time and ground down to form much smaller particles. One of the primary ingredients of sand is silica.

Sand & gravel can be found on beaches or in rivers and streams - these are mostly quartz grains. They can be formed through the process of weather, where the weaker minerals break away, resulting in resistant quartz. These then accumulate in rivers, streams, and on beaches.

Compared to other hardscaping materials, installing pea gravel is relatively easy. Generally, you work the soil about 6 inches deep, remove any weeds, lay down 2 inches of coarsely textured base rock (also called crushed rock), and cover that with a 3-inch-deep layer of pea gravel. The base rock stabilizes the pea gravel to provide a firm surface.

## Sand and Gravel | Indiana Geological & Water Survey
Sand, gravel, and specialty sand are major raw materials mined in Indiana. Weathering of rocks forms pieces of rock of various sizes and shapes as seen in Figure 1. Gravel consists of unconsolidated deposits made of pieces of rock greater than two mm in size and is almost always accompanied by sand deposits made of smaller pieces of sand.

## Sand and Gravel | The Canadian Encyclopedia
Sand and gravel are unconsolidated, granular mineral materials produced by the natural disintegration of rock caused by weathering. The terms sand, gravel, clay and silt relate to grain size rather than composition. Sand is material passing through a number 4 (4.76 mm) sieve and remaining on a number 200 (74 µm [micron]) sieve.

## Where does desert sand come from? | Questions | Naked Scientists
Answer. Sand is tiny fragments of rock. When rock wears down you get smaller bits of rock, or pebbles, and when they wear down you get even smaller bits and eventually you get down to sand, or silica. The reason it ends up washing up on the beach is that the sea or wind can move sand around very easily while rocks are more likely to stay put.

That's because mountains end their lives as sand on beaches. Over time, mountains erode. The mud, sand, gravel, cobbles and boulders they shed are washed into streams, which come together to form rivers. As they flow down to the sea, all this sediment is ground up and worn down in nature's version of a rock tumbler.
