## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.

## Iron | Geoscience Australia
The iron-ore bearing rock is first blasted and dug up from open pit mines. The ores from the major mines in Western Australia's Pilbara region are hauled from working faces to crushing and screening plants using trucks that can carry over 300 tonnes. There are three major Pilbara iron ore producers: BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP), Rio Tinto Ltd (Rio

## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
What is iron mining? Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking.  Australia makes up half of the world's iron ore exports.
