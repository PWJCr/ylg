## How to Measure Surface Finish | Surface Roughness Conversion Chart 
The method (technology) for measuring surface finish: - Profiling techniques: use a high-resolution probe to measure the surface. - Area techniques: measure the finite area and calculate a statistical average of the peaks and valleys. - Microscopy techniques: utilize the measurement of contrast to obtaining information about peaks and
