## Cyclone furnace
A cyclone furnace is a type of coal combustor commonly used in large industrial boilers.. Background. Developed in the early 1942 by Babcock & Wilcox to take advantage of coal grades not suitable for pulverized coal combustion, cyclone furnaces feed coal in a spiral manner into a combustion chamber for maximum combustion efficiency.

## Coal Bottom Ash/Boiler Slag - University of Wisconsin-Madison
There are two types of wet-bottom boilers that produce boiler slag: slag-tap and cyclone. The slag-tap boiler burns pulverized coal while the cyclone boiler burns crushed coal. Wet-bottom boiler slag is a term that describes the molten condition of the ash being drawn from the bottom of the furnaces. Both boiler types have a solid base with an

Pulverizer is operated by a prime mover as shown in the figure and the coal is sent to the furnace where combustion process takes place. Cold air is supplied separately on the way of hot air coming from the furnace and an primary air pump serves the purpose of reducing heat considerably.

Pulverized coal (pulverized fuel-pf) has been fired in rotary cement kilns (see Kilns) and boiler furnaces (see Boilers).The latter are basically boxes lined with tubes in which water is evaporated and contain a water/steam mixture. The coal is pulverized to a fine powder, usually so that 70% is less than about 75 μm in size, before being carried by part of the combustion air stream to the

## Predicting Fly Ash and Bottom Ash Combustibles in Pulverized Coal Fired 
In boilers with pulverized firing systems, about 80% of the ash in coal being fired is carried as fly ash. The other about 20% get collected as bottom ash. During the combustion of coal, some portion of the hydrocarbon, mainly char, leaves the furnace as unburned particles.
