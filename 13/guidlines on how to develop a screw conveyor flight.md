## Screw Conveyor Design, Application and Selection Guidelines, History - USA
The design of the screw is based on the theory of the inclined plane. The screw conveyor began to evolve in the late 1800s and was used as a means of increasing food and grain production to meet the needs of the rapidly growing American population. The first feed mills used screw conveyors throughout the process.
