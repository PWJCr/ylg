## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
The economic limit for open-pit mining is reached when the preparatory and stripping costs per ton of ore plus the open-pit mining cost per ton of ore plus the cost of equipment, interest, and amortization charges equal the cost per ton by mining underground plus equipment and development cost and interest and amortization charges.

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, [1] is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Open-Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, one of the most common forms, is one of the most damaging. Miners hollow out a section of land, digging down to create a workable area and extract valuable raw materials. This method leaves behind large pits in the earth and can contaminate the groundwater with chemicals used in the mining process.

Open-pit is one of the most common mining methods used and starts from the earth's surface, maintaining exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped sides to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel, allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the site.

Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where
