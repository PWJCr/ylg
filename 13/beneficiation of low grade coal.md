## Beneficiation of Low Grade Chromite Ore and Its Characterization for 
Chromite ores are primarily used for extraction of chromium, which is an expensive metal. For low grade chromite ores (containing less than 40% Cr 2 O 3), the chromium extraction is not usually economically viable. India possesses huge quantities of low grade chromite reserves. This deposit can be utilized after proper physical beneficiation.

## Chemical Beneficiation of Low Grade Coal - A Review
India is having large reserves of low grade coals. The use of low-grade coal in various industries like power plants, metallurgical plants, cement units etc. leads to environ-mental pollution because of generation of large amount of solid and gaseous pollutants. Therefore, it is of impor-tance paramount to clean the coal before its utilization. There are a number of upgrading technologies to

## beneficiation of low grade coal
The low-grade coals due to their poor washability nature do not respond efficiently toward existing coal beneficiation techniques, making the cleaning process challenging. Inefficient cleaning of such coals could potentially lead to environmental problems such as solid waste generation and gaseous emissions during combustion.

## Chemical Beneficiation of High-Ash Indian Noncoking Coal by Alkali 
Coal mined from the Talcher region of Odisha, India is known to be high-ash, surface-oxidized, and noncoking in nature. It is quite challenging to beneficiate such low-grade coal by physical or physicochemical processes due to its oxidized nature and the presence of complex ash forming mineral matter in its matrix. Chemical beneficiation is one of the alternative process to such problems

## Beneficiation of a Low Rank Coal to Produce High Quality Clean Coal
Abstract. A process was developed for the beneficiation of a low-rank coal containing relatively high ash (25.97%) and sulphur (5.78%) content. The low-rank sub-bituminous coal of Makerwal Area, Surghar Range, Punjab Province, Pakistan was cleaned by froth flotation technology to get high quality clean coal for commercial applications.

## [PDF] Bio-Physiochemical Beneficiation of Low Grade Coal from Lakhra 
Isolated microorganisms were applied on low grade reduced size/powdered coal collected from mines site. Chemical evolution of coal revealed that this sample has 44.45% of ash and 7.03% of sulfur along with 2.3% of Iron. Microbial processing was continued for maxim 36 days which successfully reduced up to 57.33% of sulfur, 75.21% ash and 87.7% iron.
