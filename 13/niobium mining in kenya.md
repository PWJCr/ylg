## How to Invest in Niobium - Element Investing
As much as 97% of 2008 world niobium production resulted from the mining pyrochlore mineral [(Na,Ca)2Nb2O6(OH,F)] in Brazil and Canada. Steelmaking, primarily high-strength low-alloy and stainless steels, accounted for about 90% niobium use.

The area also has niobium deposits estimated to be worth $35 billion. Kenyan government will earn three per cent royalties from the nobium project and five per cent from the rare earths mining. The global demand for niobium, used to strengthen steel, is rising rapidly, with Mrima Hill now positioned in the world's top six deposits.

The government of Kenya revoked the mining license issued to Cortec Mining Kenya Ltd in March 2013, stopping further exploration and mine development. The license issue has not been resolved to date, but with rising global demand for niobium and REE, the Mrima Hill deposit remains one of the largest undeveloped niobium-REE deposits in the world.

## Niobium and tantalum - USGS
Niobium and tantalum are transition metals that are almost always found together in nature because they have very similar physical and chemical properties. Their properties of hardness, conductivity, and resistance to corrosion largely determine their primary uses today. The leading use of niobium (about 75 percent) is in the production of high-strength steel alloys used in pipelines

## How to buy and export Niobium, Tantalum, Vanadium and Zirconium Ore 
The main markets for Kenyan niobium ore are Europe and North America. In these two markets, the price of the mineral is typically in the range of $60-70 per kg. Importing niobium ore into Kenya is also a viable option. It can be imported as pure niobium or as a mixture of about 70% and 30% by weight at an average price of around $60 per kg.
