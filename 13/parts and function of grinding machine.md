## What is a Drilling Machine - Drilling Machine Definition, Parts, Types 
A drilling machine, also called a drill press, is a powerful tool used to cut a round hole into or through metal, plastic, wood, or other solid materials through turning and advancing rotary drill bits into a workpiece. This drilling cutting tool is held in the drill press by a chuck and fed into the work at variable speeds.
