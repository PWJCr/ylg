Worldwide, 69 - 77 per cent of barite is used as a weighting agent for drilling fluids in oil and gas exploration to suppress high formation pressures and prevent blowouts.Its global production in 2017 was estimated at 9.5 million tonnes. China has the highest production estimated at approximately 43 per cent of global production and consuming 19 per cent of its total production.

## Despite huge deposit, Nigeria spends millions on barite import
May 13, 2021Despite abandoned barite deposit in Nigeria, the country still spends about $29.9 million to import 13,000 tonnes of the mineral resources annually to meet the consumption gap, a document from the Raw Materials Research and Development Council, has shown. Barite is the primary ore of barium, extracted to make a wide variety of barium compounds.

The United States is a net importer of barite, a critical mineral for the oil and gas industry; more than 80 percent of current domestic consumption of barite is imported from China. Nearly all of the domestic production of barite comes from stratiform deposits in Nevada.
