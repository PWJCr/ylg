May 20, 2022Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

## Turning Copper Ore into Copper: What are the Processes?
Feb 24, 2022Copper mining has typically been performed through open-pit mining, where stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the ground over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery drills holes into the rock, and even explosives are used to break the rock apart. Globally, approximately 80% of copper production is taken from various sulfide sources.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.
