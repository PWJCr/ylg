Apr 25, 2022The chemical reaction that creates iron ochre happens due to the presence of iron in the soil and is drawn up when mixed with water. Iron hydroxide is created when this mixture meets the air. The biological reaction creates the presence of an iron-containing bacterium within the water table, and this is known as Ferro-bacteria.

Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen.Several iron oxides are recognized. All are black magnetic solids. Often they are nonstoichiometric. Oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust..

The blast furnace is filled with iron ore, coke and limestone. A very hot blast of air is blown in, where it causes the coke to burn. The extreme heat makes the carbon react with iron ore, taking off the oxygen from iron oxides, and making carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is a gas and it leaves the mix. There is some sand in with the iron.

## Answered: A 0.5962 g sample of iron ore is. | bartleby
A 0.5962 g sample of iron ore is dissolved in perchloric acid (HCIO4). All iron present is oxidized to Fe3. The solution is filtered to remove solid matrix materials and made basic with addition of ammonium hydroxide. The iron precipitates as the Fe (OH)3.XH2O gel. The precipitate is collected in a cistern crucible and ignited to produce Fe203.
