## Copper goes green - Australian Resources & Investment
At the same time, copper mining and exploration activity is increasing in Australia, which ranks third in the world for copper reserves, according to US Geological Survey data. Copper exports from Australia brought in record revenues of $10.4 billion last year and forecasts point to that figure rising in the coming years.

## Australia's top producing copper mines in 2012 - Mining Technology
The Prominent Hill mine is located 650km north-west of the South Australian capital Adelaide and is wholly owned by Australian mining company Oxiana, which later became OZ Minerals. In 2011, copper production at the mine stood at 107,744t and gold production was 160,007oz. Prominent Hill's 2012 output is expected to reach 100,000t of copper
