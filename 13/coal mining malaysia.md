## Effects of coal mining on groundwater in Mukah, Sarawak, Malaysia 
With the present trend of increasing crude oil price globally, coal will be an attractive alternative of energy resource for electricity power generation in Malaysia. The presence of major elements such as SiO2 Al2O3, Na2O, K2O, Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, P2O5 and SO3 and several trace elements such as (As), Cu and Pb in the coal bodies contaminate both groundwater and surface water.

As much as 38% of global electricity generation continues to rely on coal, while Malaysia's reliance is even higher: Coal made up 50.6% of the fuels burned to generate electricity in 2017. Shockingly, just 20 years before in 1997, coal only contributed a meagre 7.4% as a source of electricity because natural gas dominated at 63.4%.
