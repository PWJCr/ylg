When materials such as concrete, stone, brick, or granite are cut or ground by workers, it can create extremely fine dust particles, which can make their way deep into the lungs if inhaled. These silica dust particles can cause scarring in the lungs, leading to a serious and irreversible lung condition known as silicosis.

## use of crushed sand in concrete
Nov 11, 2019· Parts of crushed stone are commonly used as aggregates for ready mix concrete. Concrete plants keep large quantities of different parts of crushed stone on hand to make their concrete batches. Crushed stone with stone dust in it is highly compactable and is therefore commonly used when making any kind of base for construction.
