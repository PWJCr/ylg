## Density of Cement Sand and Aggregate in Kg/m3 - Civil Sir
the relative density (specific gravity) of an aggregate is the ratio between its Mass and the Mass of an equal volume of water. Relative density = Mass of the aggregate / Mass with an equal volume of water. Most aggregates have a relative density between 2.4-2.9 with a corresponding particle density (Mass) of kg/m3 ( lb /ft3).

##  Aggregates for Concrete
Aggregates may be broadly classi fied as natural or artificial, both with respect to source and to method of preparation. Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water, while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.

5. Size and Shape. The size of aggregates less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate and beyond 4.75mm is called coarse aggregates. The size and shape of the aggregates impact the strength and durability of the concrete. The workability of concrete might be affected when using large size aggregates.

Therefore aggregate to be used in cement concrete should not be weaker than the strength of hardened cement paste.

COARSE AGGREGATE. Coarse aggregates refer to irregular and granular materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone, and are used for making concrete. In most cases, Coarse is naturally occurring and can be obtained by blasting quarries or crushing them by hand or crushers. It is imperative to wash them before using them for producing concrete.

##  A Study on The Use of Crushed Stone Aggregate and Crusher Dust  - Ijser
Crushed stone aggregate was obtained from nearby stone crusher plants of Visakhapatnam. After brushing the aggregate it was washed and dried. A set of sieves such as 53mm, 26.5mm, 9.5mm etc. have identified for the gradation of stone aggregate and for the fine aggregate 4.75mm, 2.36mm, 0.425mm, 0.075mm sizes were identified. Various percentages of
