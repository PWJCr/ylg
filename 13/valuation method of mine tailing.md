## Evaluation of metal mobility from copper mine tailings in northern 
in this context, the main objectives of this work were to (1) evaluate the effect of two amendments (caco 3 and compost) and their mixtures on the mobility and bioavailability of specific elements, using column leaching experiments and (2) compare the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil and the tailing under study as a .

## Effect of the Class C Fly Ash on Low-Reactive Gold Mine Tailing 
Beneficiation of industrial wastes, such as mine tailings (MTs), through development of alternative eco-friendly geopolymer binders for construction composites offers a twofold environmental benefit, as it reduces the demand for cement and it increases the sustainability of industrial processes by creating a value-added product from an industrial byproduct.
