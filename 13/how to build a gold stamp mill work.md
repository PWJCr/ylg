Interior of the Deadwood Terra Gold Stamp Mill. Crushed ore is washed over mercury-coated copper sheets, and fine gold particles form an amalgam with the mercury. The amalgam was scraped off and the gold then separated from the amalgam by heating and evaporating the mercury, which was then recovered by a condenser for reapplication to the plates.

In 1864, when the area was still a part of Arizona, the territory's first stamp mill was built near the steamboat landing. The 10-stamp, steam-driven mill, then processed the ore from the area mines before shipping to Yuma. The lawlessness continued as factions of Northern and Southern sympathizers developed among the miners during the Civil War.

Stampers were generally in demise by the 1890s, as gold from the mill was being lost through the use of stamper technology. The problem was addressed when John Sutherland, a graduate metallurgist who had studied at the Ballarat School of Mines, adapted the filter press from the sugar mills and adopted the use of cyanide, as recommended by the chemists, to extract the gold .

Once the rock is crushed into tiny pieces then it gets spread across a mercury-coated table. This mercury coating attracts any gold that may be present.
