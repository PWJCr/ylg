## Understanding Conveyor Systems - Types, Applications and  - Thomasnet
A conveyor belt is susceptible to static electricity as the belt is continuously pulled against the end pulleys. If electrical components are being conveyed, static electricity can be hazardous. Anti-static conveyor belt measures such as conductive belts or static control brushes should be considered to protect products.

Belt Widths The belt widths are as follows: 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 72, 84, and 96 inches. The width of the narrower belts may be governed by the size of lumps to be handled. Belts must be wide enough so that any combination of prevailing lumps and finer material does not load the lumps too close to the edge of the conveyor belt.
