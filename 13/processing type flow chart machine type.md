## What is a Process Flow Diagram | Lucidchart
A Process Flow Diagram (PFD) is a type of flowchart that illustrates the relationships between major components at an industrial plant. It's most often used in chemical engineering and process engineering, though its concepts are sometimes applied to other processes as well. It's used to document a process, improve a process or model a new one.

Grey Fabric. A cloth of flexible planar substance constructed from solutions, fibres, yarns in any combination. Textile fabrics can also be produced directly from webs of fibres by bonding fusing or interlocking to make non-woven fabrics and felts. Grey fabric is the fabric before finishing such as dyeing, printing or any other finishing terms.
