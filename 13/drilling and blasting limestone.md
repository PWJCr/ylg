## limestone drilling and blasting
One of the most fundamental stages in open pit mining is drilling and blasting A good fragmentation and a minimum ground vibration are characteristics of a successful drilling and blasting operation In this study, 78 blasting events of AlvandQoly limestone mine located in Kurdestan cement company in west of Iran were investigated The vibrations induced blasting was recorded by seismograph .

## Solved Estimate the hourly production and unit cost of rock - Chegg
Estimate the hourly production and unit cost of rock excavation by drilling and blasting. The rock is a lime-stone having a seismic velocity of 6000 ft/s (1830 m/s). Trial bloating indicates that 3 1/2 -in. (8.9-cm) holes drilled in an 8-ft (2.44-m) rectangular pattern will provide the desired fracturing.
