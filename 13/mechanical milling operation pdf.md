Milling Machine Definition. The milling machine is defined as perhaps most widely used in manufacturing industries after the lathe machine.. However, In the case of lathe machine tools, the tools used there single-point cutting tools but In the case of this machine, the tool used is multi-point cutting tools.. The milling is a process of metal-removing by feeding the workpiece passes through

The slots or cut-outs are created through the milling process. A PCB file usually contains several layers, and the mechanical layer is used to indicate the information about the PCB manufacturing and PCB. PCB milling is the process of metallic portions being removed from a board material pad. It should be accomplished if you want to design pads
