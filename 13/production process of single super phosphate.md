The production process One of the basic materials needed to make superphosphate is sulfuric acid. This is produced by burning sulfur and dissolving the fumes in water. Rock phosphate is then dissolved in the acid. The chemical reaction (which takes about half an hour) produces phosphoric acid and calcium sulfate.
