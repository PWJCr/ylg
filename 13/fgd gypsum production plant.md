##  Gypsum Association
Today, almost half of all gypsum used in the United States is "FGD" gypsum, which is derived from ﬂue- gas desulfurization. This process removes polluting gases from the stacks of fossil-fueled power plants and puriﬁes them into a hard sub- stance. This puriﬁed, solid material can then be manufactured into gypsum board.

##  Gypsum to Gypsum: From Production to Recycling
Now-a-days, synthetic gypsum produced by the Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) process of fossil fuel-fired power stations (FGD gypsum) is widely used as an alternative feedstock in the gypsum industry. Moreover, most plasterboard manufacturing plants traditionally recycle their own production waste.

FGD gypsum, also known as synthetic gypsum, is manufactured through the process of flue gas desulfurization. Flue gas desulfurization is a technology used to eliminate sulfur dioxide (SO2) from exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plants. The process keeps the air clean and provides sustainable and ecologically sound source of pure gypsum.

FGD Gypsum Production Process. Mineralogically identical to natural gypsum, FGD gypsum, or synthetic gypsum, is produced from gas captured within emission control systems at coal fired electric utilities. An emission that would compromise air quality, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) gas, is the primary contribution coal makes to FGD gypsum.

## Gypsum Board: Are Our Walls Leaching Toxins? | BuildingGreen
Domestic manufacturers are quick to point out that gypsum board manufactured in the U.S. has not been linked to indoor air quality problems, but potential leaching of heavy metals and biocides included for mold resistance are among the issues that need to be addressed more thoroughly by the gypsum board industry. Synthetic gypsum and mercury
