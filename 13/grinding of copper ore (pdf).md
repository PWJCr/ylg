It is a material cutting process which engages an abrasive tool whose cutting elements are grains of abrasive material known as grit. These grits are characterized by sharp cutting points, high hot hardness, and chemical stability and wear resistance. The grits are held together by a suitable bonding material to give shape of an abrasive tool.

Copper ore with a particle size between 0-1 mm was used in the experiments. A model was created that determines the relationship between the processing time and efficiency of the grinding, and can be used for the optimization of the process. A comparison of the relative growth of particle size fractions in milling products was performed.

3. Processing of Copper Ore. The next step is to feed the crushed ore into a wet grinding process in tumbling mills. These mills contain the ore, water and steel balls and further reduce the particles to the optimum size for the flotation process which follows. About 80% of copper from ore is generated using flotation, smelting and refining

Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to
