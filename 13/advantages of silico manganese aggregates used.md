## Manganese Slag - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A.T.M. Marsh,  S.A. Bernal, in Waste and Byproducts in Cement-Based Materials, 2021 11.4.5 Manganese and silico-manganese slag. Mn slag is generated in the electrolytic production of ferromanganese alloys. The specific gravity of Mn slag is in the range of 2.88-3.17 g/cm 3.Mn slag contains considerable amounts of Si and anhydrite and smaller amounts of Mn residue.

Manganese removes oxygen and sulfur when iron ore (an iron and oxygen compound) is converted into iron. It also is an essential alloy that helps convert iron into steel. As an alloy, it decreases the brittleness of steel and imparts strength. The amount of manganese used per ton of steel is rather small, ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms.

## technology for silico manganese production
Jun 19, 2018 · Medium C Fe-Mn can be produced either by refining high C Fe-Mn with O2 or by the silico-thermic route, where the Si in Si-Mn is used to reduce additional MnO added as ore or slag. Refining of high C Fe-Mn with O2 - The process is also known as the manganese oxygen refining (MOR) process and is patented by Union Carbide.
