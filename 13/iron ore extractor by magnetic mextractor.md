Preparation of Wrought Iron. This is done by heating cast iron with haematite (Fe 2 O 3) which oxidizes C to CO, S to SO 2, Si to SiO 2, P to P 4 O 10 and Mn to MnO. Fe 2 O 3 + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO. Where CO and SO 2 escape, manganous oxides (MnO) and Silica (SiO 2) combine to form slag. MnO + SiO 2 → MnSiO 3.

The extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process, that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag.  In this part, Haematite (Fe 2 O 3) and Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) are reduced to Ferrous Oxide (FeO). Reactions in the Blast furnace at 500 - 800 K, In the upper parts with lower temperatures,

Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.
