Dolomite as a ceramic material is a uniform calcium magnesium carbonate. In ceramic glazes, it is used as a source of magnesia and calcia. Other than talc, dolomite is the principal source of MgO in high-temperature raw glazes. 'Dolomite matte' stoneware glazes, for example, are highly prized for their pleasant 'silky' surface texture.

Fire Clay Bricks. The Al2O3 content of the fire clay bricks is 30% ~ 40%. Fire clay bricks are kind of weak acid refractory brick products, which can resist the erosion of acid slag and acid gas. They have weaker resistance to alkaline substances. Clay fire bricks have good thermal properties and are resistant to rapid cooling and heat.

## Fire Resistance of Concrete Materials and Structures
An excellent resistance to fire is shown for a temperature greater than 1000 degree Celsius. A better performance is given by aggregates that are of carbonate type like limestone, lime rock and dolomite. These tend to perform good in fire as these exposed to heat will heat up the calcine and will liberate carbon di oxide.

Fire-Resistant. Fire-resistant and flame-resistant products are designed to be nonflammable at a chemical level, and to self-extinguish without melting or dripping when directly exposed to extreme heat. To determine a material's flame-resistance, a product must be tested and rated using the ASTM F1959 standard.

## Dolomite Powder Mainly Used As A Fire Retardant
Dolomite has not been widely known by WPC industry, although it has siginifcant advantages such as effective fire retardant, white color, low cost, easy-supply. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of dolomite powder content on the water resistance, mechanical properties, and the relative flammability (limiting oxygen
