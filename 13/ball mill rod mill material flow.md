## ball mill material flow
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed system, with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.

The geometric restrictions on the axial and radial movement of the rods inside the drum, in addition to the restricted particle-rod interactions affected the axial and radial dispersion of the material flowing through the rod mill. On the other hand, particulate segregation in the ball mill is almost eliminated among all material components

## Highly Efficient Rod Mill | Fote Machinery
Rod mill on working site. 1 The rod mill usually uses a steel rod with a diameter of 50-100 mm as a grinding medium. The length of the steel rod is 25-50 mm shorter than that of the cylinder, and is usually made of high carbon steel containing 0.8%-1% carbon. 2 The loading amount of the rod is about 35%-45% of the effective volume of the rod

## Rod mills, how they function - Mine Engineer.Com
The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6. Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size range of 3000 to 270 mm (-4 to -35 mesh).

## material flow ball mill
Jan 25, 2012 As mentioned above, the difference in the material flow behavior between the ball mill and the rod mill partially explains the well known difference in the product particle size distribution of ball mills and rod mills. In the case of ball mills, the axial dispersion is higher and the mean residence time is shorter than those in rod mills.Jul 18, 2008 In a ball Mill material is
