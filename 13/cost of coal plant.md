## Ammonia plant cost comparisons: Natural gas, Coal, or Electrolysis 
A recent feasibility study compares the costs of building and operating a new ammonia plant using one of three technologies: natural gas, coal, or electrolysis. Unsurprisingly, natural gas is the most competitive today. However, it might surprise you how closely competitive electrolysis has become. I've written variations on this theme before

## Operating Ratio and Cost of Coal Power Generation, Ccc/272
The cost of coal-fired power generation differs not only from one country to another but also from one power plant to another. However, current coal-fired power generation is in competition with renewable energy and thus generation has shifted in many countries from baseload to load following mode necessitating flexibility in power plant
