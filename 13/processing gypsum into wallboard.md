## Gypsum Processing India
Raw gypsum ore is processed into a variety of products such as a portland cement additive, soil conditioner, industrial and building plasters, and gypsum wallboard. To produce plasters or wallboard, gypsum must be partially dehydrated or calcined to produce calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4 H 2O), commonly called stucco.
