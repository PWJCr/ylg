## Understanding creepage and clearance in harsh industrial and automotive 
Creepage, as shown in Figure 4, is the shortest path between two conductive materials along the surface of an isolator. As an example, according to Table 10 in IEC, the minimum creepage distance for a working voltage of 1,080 V RMS, insulating material group I, pollution degree II, and reinforced isolation is 10.8 mm.

Ravi S. Gorur, in The Electrical Engineering Handbook, 2005 5.7.1 Additional Units and Longer Leakage Units. If the line or station is in the design stage, increasing leakage distance by adding additional bells or using longer leakage distance bells (such as the fog-type insulator) in a string is a practice followed routinely by users for both line and station insulation and is quite successful.

Determination of creepage distance: According to the working voltage and insulation level, check the table 6 to determine the creepage distance But usually: (1) Primary AC part: L-N≥2.5mm before the fuse, L.N earth ≥2.5mm, there is no requirement after the fuse, but try to keep a certain distance to avoid short-circuit damage to the power supply.

## Creepage Distance of Insulator - Electrical Concepts
Creepage Distance is the shortest path between two conductive parts measured along the surface of the insulation as shown in figure below. When a flashover occurs in the system this distance helps the flashovers not to interfere with the live systems.

What is creepage: The distance measure of along the surface of the solid insulating material is called creepage distance. The creepage distance is depending upon the weather condition. Minimum creepage distance are 16-25 mm/kV. For high pollution area, these value must be increased.

Abstract: The influence of a number of ionic liquid contaminants and of some oils upon the tracking behavior of three typical insulants, (phenolic-bonded paper board, cellulose-filled alkyd molding and glass-filled polyester dough molding compound), is measured in terms of electrode separation (creepage) and resistance to tracking as determined by the wet contamination test of IEC 112. For any one contaminant the IEC test predicts the correct order of the tracking resistance of the insulants

Minimum creepage distances have been established for two classes of insulating materials which are used in marine electrical equipment and are susceptible and resistant to tracking. These distances are given for items of equipment with rated voltages of 500, 660, and 760 V as the result of tests on insulating elements contaminated in a naturai way during many years' service on ships.

## creepage distance in electrical plant equipment
Creepage Distance. Creepage (Leakage distance) is the shortest path between two conductive parts (or between a conductive part and the bounding surface of the equipment) measured along the surface of the insulation. A proper and adequate creepage distanceprotects against tracking, a process that produces a partially conducting.

## creepage distance in electrical plant equipment
Creepage distance and clearance requirements are tied to a variety of electrical and environmental factors addressed by safety standards. Equipment intended to be approved to IEC standards must be designed with spacings between conductive parts that are sufficient to ensure user safety in the presence of hazardous voltages.
