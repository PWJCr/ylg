Weir Minerals offered a cost-effective solution to reduce the number of crushing stages in their circuit to produce fine material. A new Trio® TV95 crusher comprising of four port rotors was installed. The crusher increased the material amount passing through the critical sieve immediately, from 36% to 41%, resulting in finer material.

Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars, and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used, the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.

23 May 2017. The two most important factors when producing sand and aggregate is shape (referred to as cubical crushed particles) and maximum yield of highest value product. Every successful aggregate producer can achieve both with the right raw materials, the right equipment, the right flow sheet and the right operation of equipment.

## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
For this reason, companies typically deploy cone crushers as part of a more extensive system of crushing equipment. A first-stage crusher, such as an impact or jaw crusher is used to break raw material down to a size that the cone crusher can accommodate. Cone crushers are typically looked at as a secondary or tertiary stage of crushing.
