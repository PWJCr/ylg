## Why is iodized salt is easier to dissolve in water than the rock salt 
Salt Type. For example, rock salt diffuses less readily than table salt or canner's salt. This is because rock salt has more impurities, which take more time for water molecules to break up. Does rock salt dissolve easily? Salt will dissolve in room temperature or cold water as well, but heating the water speeds up the process. Place the rock

## Asphalt
Asphalt, also known as bitumen (UK: / ˈ b ɪ tj ʊ m ɪ n /, US: / b ɪ ˈ tj uː m ə n, b aɪ-/), is a sticky, black, highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch.Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos.

## Why does iodized salt dissolve faster than rock salt? - Heimduo
Yes! The crushed salt dissolve faster than table salt, since when the salt in crushed into small crystal, its surface area is increased therefore it dissolve faster as compared to table salt which has large surface area. If you are asking 'how long' it would take to dissolve salt in water, it is therefore a question of mass transfer kinetics.
