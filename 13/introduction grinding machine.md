## Introduction to Metallographic Grinding and Polishing
Metallographic grinding and polishing processes differ depending on the sample material. These differences usually affect the consumables required or the number of necessary grinding and polishing steps. For example, steel with a hardness between 35 and 65 HRC (medium-hard to hard steels) is relatively easy to prepare.
