## Gold leaching from ores using biogenic lixiviants - A review
Jan 1, 2022Groudev et al. (1999) used solutions that contained amino acids of microbial origin and thiosulphate to leach the gold and silver from oxide ores that contained 3.5 g/t of gold and 14 g/t of silver. First, an alkaline solution (pH 10-10.5) was irrigated on the top of the heap to stabilize the pH.

Gold heap leaching is applicable for processing auriferous quartz type sulfide ore. Hence, the metal sulfide ore flotation concentrate with higher gold content cannot use cyanidation process before calcinations. The total recovery for the above ores that pass through the flotation-cyanidation process is about 95%.

In the short-term gold heap leaching process, the ore is usually crushed to less than 20 mm. When processing gold-bearing quartz veins, it is often crushed to less than 6 mm.

Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

01 Granulation. To make the gold heap leaching process successful, the heap leaching material must have good permeability so that the cyanide solution can evenly pass through the ore pile. Most ores need to be crushed to 25.4mm or finer before granulation in order to expose the gold contained in the ore and improve the gold recovery rate.

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.

## Rcovery of gold in pyritic ores - Mine Engineer.Com
Using cyanide to recover gold from sulfide ores generally results in 30 to 35% recovery, and the best I have heard of is around 50% recovery. The fine coating of a iron compound definitely appears to be a key component of the inability of cyanide to efficiently leach low grade pyritic ores. Perhaps there is some room here for a pretreatment, to
