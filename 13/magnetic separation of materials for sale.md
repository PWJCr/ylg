## Magnetic separation of waste is also possible for heavy materials
Magnetic separation of waste based on density can now be taken to a whole new level. As researchers from the Dutch cities of Utrecht and Nijmegen have demonstrated that it is also possible to separate heavier elements this way. Consider, for example, precious metals in a discarded telephone. Magnetic Density Separation (MDS) is a phenomenon

Results from the magnetic separation using a59.12 ± 0.05 mT magnet is presented in Table 3. From the table, it is observed that for coarser particlesizes, less iron content is recovered. This is due to interferences from gangue materials surrounding the magnetic particles making it less exposed to the magnetic field to be attracted.

Abstract A review of the basic concepts and mechanisms related to the electronic phase separation and the formation of nanoscale inhomogeneities in magnetic materials is given. We put the main emphasis onto strongly correlated electron systems such as manganites, where phase separation occurs due to the competition of ferro- and antiferromagnetic states, as well as cobaltites, where the spin

## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and paramagnetic.
