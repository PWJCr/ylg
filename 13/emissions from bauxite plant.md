## Emissions for Manufacturing - Baux
BAUX products are produced and manufactured in Sweden. However, we have established local factories in the USA and Australia to shorten lead times and reduce transportation emissions. As a product based company, manufacturing will always play a big role in our total CO2 emissions. Today, 75% of our factories run on renewable energy.

## TENORM: Bauxite and Alumina Production Wastes | US EPA
Bauxite is used to produce alumina, which is then used to produce aluminum. Wastes can be generated at several points in the production process, including during the mining of the bauxite ore, and during the refinery production process. The refinery processes used to produce aluminum generates about 2 - 2.5 tons of solid waste for every 1 ton

## The Transformation of Bauxite to Aluminum (and the Products in Between)
An electrical current is run through the mixture, causing the carbon from the carbon anode to attach to the oxygen component in the alumina, yielding aluminum and carbon dioxide: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C > 4 Al + 3 CO2. This process takes place at temperatures between º C and yields an aluminum of high purity.
