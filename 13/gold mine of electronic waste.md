If done correctly, recovering precious metals from e-waste is not only environmentally friendly but also more economical than mining it from the earth. According to UN data, the deposits found in e-waste are estimated to be between 40 and 50 times richer and decrease the need for further tapping of natural resources.

## Recycling Gold From E-Waste: Is It Profitable?
Feb 19, 2021Recycling gold from e-waste is a great alternative to consigning old electronics to landfills. According to a United Nations report published in 2019 the world produces as much as 50 million tonnes (metric tons) of electronic waste every year. These are items that can hurt the environment and lead to bigger landfills.

## Electronic waste: a hidden gold mine | Press room
Incessant demand for electronic equipment produces huge amounts of waste, and in 2016 alone, e-waste amounted to 44.7 megatonnes - including 724 kilotonnes from Canada. Although e-waste contains substances that are hazardous to health and the environment, it also contains precious metals that are financially appealing to the recycling industry.

## Electronics Recyclers: The Gold Mining Stocks You've Never Heard Of
That smartphone you dropped in the toilet last month. Electronics recycling is a surprisingly cost-effective way to "mine" precious metals.

If one million smartphones sounds like a big number
