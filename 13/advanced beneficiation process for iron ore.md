## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
Beneficiation process. Magnetite is the most important iron ore mineral. Cut-off grade is 20%, and the industrial grade is 25%. There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process
Iron Ore Beneficiation Process. During the last ten years great strides have been made, on the Mesabi range, in the practice of beneficiating low grade iron ore material. By beneficiation is meant all methods of removing impurities, and raising the iron content to a point where it can be sold in open market, the principal impurities being
