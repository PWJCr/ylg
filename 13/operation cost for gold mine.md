## Operating Cost for Miners | SRK Consulting
Opening a new mine or expanding an existing operation can be a challenging and daunting task. Aside from assessing and evaluating social-environmental concerns and designing the mining and material movement approach, the first question often asked is, "how much will it cost us to mine?" This may need to be determined even before you decide that there is a potential project.

## The Real Cost of Mining Gold | Kitco Commentary
The Real Cost of Mining Gold. Since the bull market for gold began in 2003, the world's major gold mining companies have produced tens of millions of ounces of gold and have raised (and written-off) many billions of dollars for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Despite a gold price that appreciated from $344 to $1260 an ounce from 2003

These numbers report that the cost of extracting an ounce of gold is actually over $1,000 per ounce, well above the aforementioned numbers. And since gold is currently trading at just over $1,200 per ounce, it explains why mining companies have had less-than-stellar profits. Determining the costs of mining largely depend on the region as well.

Successful gold mining is generally done in two steps: First is sampling or prospecting, and then, production. While some gold-bearing creeks and rivers tend to have gold values dispersed throughout their entire streambeds, there is generally not enough gold to make a small-scale mining operation payoff very well.

The Giant Mine was a gold mine located on the Ingraham Trail, 5 km (3.1 mi) north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.Giant Mine is within the Kam Group, which is part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt. Gold was discovered on the property and mineral claims staked in 1935 by Johnny Baker, but the true extent of the gold deposits was not known until 1944, when a massive gold-bearing shear
