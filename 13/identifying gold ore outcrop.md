## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.

Jul 20, 2022Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

## How to Identify Gold Ore?
Aug 31, 2022The gold ore can be identified if the heavy metal is a bright yellow color. The first step in determining whether you have struck gold ore is to identify what type of gold ore you have. There are several ways to do this, including using a metal detector. Some gold detectors can detect gold as small as a half-grain diameter.
