## Quikrete vs. Portland Cement: What Are The Major Differences?
Portland Cement is formed by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln. This process forms clinker, a solid material, and is then ground and mixed with about 2 to 3 percent gypsum to create a fine powder. The fine powder that results is Portland cement. There are many different types of Portland cement available, with ordinary Portland
