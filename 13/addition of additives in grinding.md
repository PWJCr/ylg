## Understanding the Function of Additives in Industrial Painting
Additives play a very important role in how the resin cures within the coating as it is exposed to air. When first applied, the coating is typically uneven due to the irregular shape of the materials within the paint. However, as it lays on the target surface, the particles slowly mesh together and form a tight seal against outside elements.
