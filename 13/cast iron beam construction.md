## Step 2. Design asscontainer
Step 2. Design a beam width based on the fact that the typical width of an LVL beam is 1 3/4 inches. The width can be increased by laminating in multiples of 1 3/4 inches. Beam width should be 1/4 to 1/3 beam depth.Beam spans in these tables range from 15-feet to 45-feet, in 5-foot increments. Girder spans also range from 15 feet to 45 feet in 5-foot increments for each of the beam spans noted.

In a building, a cantilever is constructed as an extension of a continuous beam, and in bridges, it is a segment of a cantilever girder. It can be constructed either cast-in-situ or by segmental construction by pre-stressing methods. Cantilever construction allows overhanging structures without additional supports and bracing.

Cast-iron architecture was a popular type of building design used throughout the world in the mid-1800s. Its popularity was due, in part, to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness — a regal exterior facade could be mass-produced inexpensively with cast iron. Entire structures could be prefabricated and shipped around the world as "portable

Cast Iron. Cast iron was  Figure 2 - steel core construction, New York c.1930. Using steel as a building material is not without its disadvantage, good in both compression and tension due to the ability to dictate a specific cross section profile, it softens at high temperatures so to prevent the collapse of buildings in the event of fire

In this method, the strain distribution in the cast- iron cross-section is defined. Based on this, the stress distri- bution is calculated, which can then be used to obtain the bending moment capacity of the cast-iron beam. A strain- based approach is developed in this paper.
