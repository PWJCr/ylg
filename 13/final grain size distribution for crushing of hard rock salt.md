## sedimentary rock - Grain size | Britannica
Grain size. Particle size is an important textural parameter of clastic rocks because it supplies information on the conditions of transportation, sorting, and deposition of the sediment and provides some clues to the history of events that occurred at the depositional site prior to final induration. Determining the sizes of the discrete particles that constitute a sedimentary rock can be

## How to Crush Grains - Midwest Supplies
A properly cracked grain has a range of particle sizes that create a compromise between extraction and lautering. You are looking to crack just the outer shell of the grain. A Grain Mill is the ideal way to crack grain, but a rolling pin, beer bottle, etc., will work as well. Just place the grains in a zip lock bag and crack away.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed. WW2 expedited the development of this machinery, and crushed stone began to be widely used in construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s.

For example, difficulties with filtration are minimised, and the tendency of crystals to bind together or cake into large solid lumps during storage is reduced, if the crystals are of relatively uniform size.

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
The Bond' Crushing Work Index is common to calculate the power needed to crush rocks from a given F80 size to a resulted P80 product size. Bond's impact method comes from a double mirrored pendulum impact crusher test on <76mm but >51mm (3″ and 2″) square rock pieces.

## What's the Difference Between the Real Salt Grain Sizes?
The only difference in the type of salt we offer is the grain size. However, grain size makes a big difference depending on what you want to do with the salt. For example, you don't want to use coarse salt on popcorn; you want to use powder salt. Similarly, you don't want to use fine salt for seasoning meat; it's better to use kosher.

Grain size is the diameter of singular sediment grains, or the lithified particles in clastic rocks. The term may apply to other granular materials, too. This differs from the size of a crystallite, which refers to the size of a single crystal within a particle or grain. Many crystals can be composed of a single grain.

Grain—A rock or mineral particle. Gradation—Relative size distribution of particles Well graded—No sizes lacking or no excess of any size range, poorly sorted. Poorly graded—Skip grades or excess of certain size ranges, may be well sorted. Silt and clay—Particles smaller than Number 200 mesh sieve, identified by behavioral characteristics
