Some barite-rich zones are more than 30 m (100 ft) thick. Some of these deposits contain millions of tons of barite easily beneficiated for use in drilling fluid and chemical plants. The structural configuration of the ore bodies and enclosing rocks make many of these deposits amenable to surface mining methods.

## Barite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ). It receives its name from the Greek word "barys" which means "heavy." This name is in response to barite's high specific gravity of 4.5, which is exceptional for a nonmetallic mineral. The high specific gravity of barite makes it suitable for a wide range of industrial, medical, and

##  Barite (BARIUM) - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Most barite is mined from layers of sedimentary rock which formed when barite precipitated onto the bottom of the ocean. Some smaller mines utilize barite from veins, which formed when barium sulfate was precipitated from hot subterranean waters. In some cases, barite is a by-product of mining lead, zinc, silver, or other metal ores.

## Environmental Impact of Mining Exploitation: A Case Study of Some Mines 
On safety: the deep trenches left by artisanal exploitation constitute a real danger to the lives of local residents and animals of the area. This risk is important during mining operations and after the abandonment of the mine site (Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(b)).On recovery rate: one of the main commitments of the mining operators before starting a mine is to ensure the maximum exploitation of

## Baryte Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
Baryte Mining usually applies wet magnetic separation to beneficiate some iron-bearing mineral, like siderite, which applies to barite ore that is used in barium-based medicine requiring low iron barite. Floatation: As for the barite with fine particle size and gravity tailings, JXSC Mining applies the process of floatation.
