The Compressive strength of specimen can be calculated by dividing maximum load carried by the specimen by cross-sectional area of the specimen cubes. The surface area of specimen: = 150 x 150 = 22500mm² = 225cm². Assume, The Max compression load is 450KN. 1KN = 1000N ; 450Kn = 450×100 = 450000N.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

## how to crush a concrete cube
· The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures. The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix. Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength. When you crush it the result should be equal or more than 60 Mpa.
