## Forklift Hydraulic System | Forklift Service | Forklift Parts | ProLift
Forklift hydraulic systems, using cylinders, operate similarly. The hydraulic fluid is pumped from a reservoir or sump, into a system of tubing. The pressure with which this fluid moves is equal to the flow introduced by the pump. This flow is measured in gallons-per-minute (GPM). Since the liquid will not compress, the pressure introduced by

Bottom ash is most commonly conveyed in a hydraulic system in which the ash is entrained in a high flow, circulating water system and delivered to either an ash pond or to a remote dewatering device. Alternatively, mechanical drag systems have been used to convey bottom ash to the dewatering storage bin because they use less water and usually have a lower initial cost.
