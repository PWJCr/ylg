Typical open cut grades. Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.

Sep 28, 2020Overview of Open Pit Mining Process. Open pit mining, which is also known as open cast or open cut mining, is a type of surface mining process that extracts rock or minerals from the ground from an open-air pit. This type of mining process is mostly used in the mining industry around the world as it does not require the presence of tunnels.

## The Four Main Methods of Mining - OreFlow
Surface mining is done in five ways: Strip mining - Strip mining is the most common surface mining method used to mine coal and lignite. The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral. Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface. Open-pit mining - Open-pit mining is

Open pit mines can be used in coal mining, and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores, copper, gold, iron, aluminum, and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine, the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation, since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.
