Hydraulic Elevators have a low initial cost but are limited by a slow travel speed of 200' (61 m) per minute and a limited distance of approximately 60' (18.3 m). Hydraulic Elevators have an elevator pit depth of 4'-6' (1.2-1.8 m) and require an additional machine room at the ground floor adjacent to the elevator shaft.

## Bucket elevator chain specification
 Bucket elevators operate by using an endless belt or chain on which rectangular buckets are mounted. This belt or chain revolves between a top and bottom pulley and the buckets move with it.  At the bottom, the buckets pick up product fed into the elevator boot and at the top the product is discharged as the bucket turns downward over head.
