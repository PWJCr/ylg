Installing a crushed limestone driveway can set homeowners back by about $1.25 to $2 per square foot of driveway space. A 16×48 foot crushed limestone driveway can cost between $960 and $1,536. A smaller driveway may only require a budget of $300 to $350, while a longer and larger driveway may require up to $60,000 in budget.

These hot gases rise up in the blast furnace and cool down. From a maximum of 2000 °C at the level of the hot-blast nozzles (tuyere), the temperature decreases to around 200 °C up to the throat. At this temperature, the filled charge are first dried and preheated. This zone of the blast furnace is therefore called the preheating zone.

Apr 12, 2022The smelting process was performed using a Mini Blast Furnace pilot plant with a capacity of ten tons of ore per day or 350 kg per batch. In the interest of modifying the properties of slag and enhance selective reduction, limestone and coal were used.  Selective reduction proved can be enhanced by amount of limestone fed into Mini Blast

Blast furnace slag is a combination of silica and other non-ferrous components of iron ore, ash from coke used as a reducing material, and limestone auxiliary material. Because its specific gravity is less than that of pig iron, during the heating process the molten slag rises above the pig iron allowing it to be easily separated and recovered.

A blast furnace can be used to extract iron from its ore. Components other than just the ore are added to the furnace to extract the iron. One of these key components is limestone, which is primarily composed of calcium carbonate, CaCO3. The heat from the blast furnace causes the calcium carbonate to decompose into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.

This wouldn't melt at the temperature of the furnace, and would eventually clog it up.  Most of the molten iron from a Blast Furnace is used to make one of a number of types of steel. There isn't just one substance called steel

## Lime in the Steel Industry | Graymont
Lime is used to convert iron into 'pig iron'. In the blast furnace, finely ground or granular limestone (with a low sulfur and alkali content) is used together with finely ground lime to convert ore into pig iron. The pig iron is later processed into steel. Lime is used as a fluxing agent in electric arc furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces.

## Iron and Steel | Lhoist - Minerals and lime producer
Fine-crushed limestone is used as a flux in iron ore sintering. It adjusts the overall chemistry of the iron burden and plays a vital role in the formation of slag in the blast furnace process. Lime-based binders - sometimes including special clays - increase sinter plant productivity. Higher percentages of ultra-fine ore can also be combined

## Blast Furnace - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The main outputs of blast furnaces includes pig iron and slag, which is formed by combination of limestone with sulfur and other impurities. Pig iron is typically tapped every 3 to 5 hours in quantities of 300 to 600 tons.After tapping, the pig iron is transported, typically in liquid form, to steel-making operations.
