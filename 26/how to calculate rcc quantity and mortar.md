## How to Compute Brick Quantity in Wall | Calculation of Bricks
Therefore, brick and mortar volume: (Brick length + Mortar thickness) x (brick width) x (brick height + mortar thickness) = 9.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 = 149.65 inch3. Convert cubic inch to cubic feet = 149.65 inch3/1728 = .0866 FT3. Bricks and mortar volume = .0866 FT3
