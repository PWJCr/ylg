## econemic importance of hematite
Hematite Economic Importance. Although other minerals such as magnetite have higher iron concentrations hematite is so much more abundant that it is easily the most economically important iron ore. In North America over 90 of our iron comes from hematite deposits and without hematite our steel-based society could not exist.

## Hematite Crystals Benefits (Explained) - Hobbyist Geek
Hematite is found in large quantities on Earth's surface and crust. It is an important ore of iron. Hematite is an iron oxide and is composed of around 70% iron and 30% oxygen. It is widely found in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. Hematite crystal belongs to the class of the rhombohedral lattice system.

However, the most significant use of magnetite lies in its status as an ore of iron and its industrial importance in manufacturing steel. Magnetite is an important material component of power plants as it is used to generate electricity. Magnetite, owing to its magnetic properties, is widely used in compasses and other navigation devices.

Hematite is the most important ore of iron.  Hematite has a wide variety of other uses, but their economic significance is very small compared to the importance of iron ore. The mineral is used to produce pigments, preparations for heavy media separation, radiation shielding, ballast, and many other products.

Hematite is dense and hard, it is the most important ore of iron because of its high iron content and its abundance.The mineral occurs in various habits: steel-gray crystals and coarse-grained varieties with a brilliant metallic luster are known as specular hematite; thin, scaly forms make up micaceous hematite; and crystals in petal-like arrangements are called iron roses.

Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.
