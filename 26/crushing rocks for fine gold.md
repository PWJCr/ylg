There is no substitute for micro classifying, especially when running powdered rock.

Once the ore has been broken up into fine dust, testing for free gold content in hardrock ore can be done using some type of gravity method. A simple gold pan can be used to sample small amounts of crushed ore, or if a decent water supply is available then it can be run through many types of separation devices.

## In What Rock Formations Can Gold Be Found? | Sciencing
Alluvium is a deposit of eroded materials and sediment that is gathered into one area. As gold and other materials are eroded, the small pieces are pushed by water and other forces into creek and river beds and other depressions. Because gold is heavier than most other naturally occurring materials, it settles at the bottom of these deposits.
