## The geology of coal - Mining for schools
The coal measures are generally shallow, largely unfaulted and lightly inclined, making their exploitation suitable for opencast and mechanised mining. The largest reserves of coal are found in Europe (30%), North America (28%), East Asia (13%), South East Asia (12%) and South and Central Asia (11%).

All five coal seams are developed on Goedgevonden. The No. 1 Seam is of low quality, thin and only developed in paleo-low areas.

The No. 3 Seam is of good quality but, with an average thickness of only 0.3 metres, is uneconomic.

Underground coal mine: When the coal is too deep to surface mine, a mining company will build an underground mine. They can tunnel into the coal seam or drill a large shaft down to the mining level. These shafts are large enough to lower mining equipment and workers into the mine and remove coal. Extra shafts must be built to ventilate the mine.

of the faults are small. At present, the large operating coal mines are on the western side of the anticline. The coal in the Henryetta and Morris beds is of high volatile A and B bituminous ranks. Coal from the Henryetta bed was being used in 1952 in blends for the manufacture of coke at the Sheffield steel plant at Houston, Tex.

## Coal Geology - Ohio Department of Natural Resources
Coal is formed from the accumulation of undecayed plant material that once grew in swampy mires over long periods of time. Burial of this plant material under sedimentary rocks generates heat and pressure, which in turn causes physical and chemical changes to the plant material. The material is first transformed it into peat and then into coal.

## Coal mining | GeoKansas - University of Kansas
Coal was likely mined from a hillside near Fort Leavenworth in northeastern Kansas as early as 1827, the year the fort was established. By the late 1850s, Missourians were mining coal for use by blacksmiths near what is now Weir, in southeastern Kansas. Just before and after the Civil War, coal production became central to the expansion of

## Geology and Mineral Resources - Coal Mine Mapping - Virginia
Key objectives of Virginia's mine mapping program are: To develop as complete a collection as possible of all known maps of coal mines in the Southwest Virginia Coalfield. To make all mine maps available in digital format through a searchable database. To develop a spatially accurate GIS dataset representing active and abandoned coal mines
