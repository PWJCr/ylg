## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

## Effects of surface coal mining and land reclamation on soil properties 
The processes of surface coal mining inevitably cause the degradation of minesoils. Factors such as soil compaction, contamination, weathering and bioturbation result in drastic changes in the soil horizon, texture, hydraulic properties, and productivity. Inappropriate mining and reclamation measures may aggravate the minesoil functional

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Mining can often be devastating — causing water acidification, soil erosion and the degradation of local ecosystems. While some methods have less impact than others, it almost always has a serious and lasting environmental impact. Fortunately, there is some hope that mining will become more sustainable in the future.
