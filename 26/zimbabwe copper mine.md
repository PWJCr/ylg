## Zim to resume copper mining - Zimbabwe Situation
Jul 18, 2021He warned of a supply side "that is completely under-prepared". Zimbabwe last produced copper at Mhangura around 2000 before the mine was closed due to subdued international prices. The depth of the mine increased costs of production. Copper is currently trading at US$10 000 per tonne — the highest in a decade — on the London Metal Exchange.
