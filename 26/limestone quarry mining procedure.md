Mining. Limestone has been a valuable resource since Missouri became a state. In early open pit operations, limestone was mined and crushed by hand and removed from the quarries by mules, carts and tramways. Limestone is now mined using surface and underground methods. Surface quarrying is the most common method of producing limestone in Missouri.
