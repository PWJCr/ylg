As high-grade iron ore deposits are gradually being depleted, more difficult-to-process ores such as goethite-rich, low-grade iron ores and tailings are now being processed. These ores often contain impurities and require some form of beneficiation in order to achieve the typical grades required for sale to downstream steel producers.

## Gold Ore Beneficiation Process and Equipment - Xinhai
With the depletion of high-grade gold ore reserves, research on medium and low-grade, refractory gold ores and strengthening of traditional gold beneficiation processes have become the mainstream trends in global gold beneficiation. Gold ore has high mining value, and its beneficiation process is relatively complex, and the beneficiation process and equipment are not the same.

Iron ore pelletizing systems.Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel. India's KIOCL considers building iron ore plants in Iran.

Therefore, prime objective of beneficiation is to meet the physical standards as required for iron making. The entire run of mine (r.o.m.) iron ore is processed, Comprise: 1. Dry-Processing high-grade (> 65% Fe) hematite iron ore are subjected to dry process of beneficiation to obtain calibrated lumps i.e., -40+ 10 mm (for blast furnace); -18+6
