## What is Frac Sand? And how is it used in fracking? - Black Mountain Sand
Frac sand is a naturally occurring crystalline silica (quartz) sand that is processed from high-purity sandstone. In its make-up, frac sand differs only slightly from other types of sand, as grains of quartz silica are a major constituent of most inter-coastal sands.  Frac Sand Mining Step 4. Once the sand has settled, it is conveyed to a

##  Silica Sand Mining EIS Meeting.gov
Not all silica sands can be used for hydrofracking. To meet the industry specifications, frac sand needs to be nearly pure quartz, very well rounded, and must meet tight size gradation standards. The sand must also have a high compressive strength, generally between 6,000 psi and 14,000 psi. Sands that meet these specifications are mined from

## Sand mining
These minerals are often found in ordinary sand deposits. A process known as elutriation is used, whereby flowing water separates the grains based on their size, shape, and density. Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife. [5]
