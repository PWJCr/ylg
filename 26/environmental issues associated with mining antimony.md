## Geochemical behaviors of antimony in mining-affected water environment 
Antimony (Sb) is a harmful element, and Sb pollution is one of the typical environmental issues in China, meaning that understanding of the geochemical behaviors of Sb is the key to control the fate of environmental Sb pollution. Sb tends to migrate in soluble form in the water-sediment system, but the fate of dissolved Sb is poorly known. Duliujiang river basin, located in southwest China

## Antimony in the environment: a review focused on natural waters: I 
Antimony is present in the aquatic environment as a result of rock weathering, soil runoff and anthropogenic activities. Typical concentrations of dissolved antimony in unpolluted waters are less than 1 μg/l. However, in the proximity of anthropogenic sources, concentrations can reach up to 100 times natural levels.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.
