## Concrete Mix Design | Different Grades of Concrete - CIVIL READ
The following formula is used to find the quantity of coarse aggregate in 1m 3 of concrete. Volume of Aggregate = Aggregate ⁄ Cement+Sand+Aggregate x 1.57. Density of aggregate may go higher if void spaces decreases. 5mm aggregate has more density when compared with 20mm size of aggregate. Hence We require 1326Kg of 20mm aggregate for 1m 3 of

The basket and aggregate are weighed while suspended in water, which is at a temperature of 22 0 C to 32 0 C. The basket and aggregates are removed from water and dried with dry absorbent cloth. The surface dried aggregates are also weighed. The aggregate is placed in a shallow tray and heated to about 110 0 C in the oven for 24 hours. Later
