TYPES OF CHEMICAL ADMIXTURES. These are normally categorised as follows - 1.

## The Role Of Concrete Admixtures In Special Concrete Preparation
Types of Concrete Admixtures. Concrete admixtures fall into two broad categories depending on their nature; chemical admixtures and mineral admixtures. Chemical admixtures, as the name suggests, are manufactured substances that are added to concrete during the mixing process to improve its quality or quicken some processes such as curing.

## Definition EN 934 Part 2:otive-ev
Definition EN 934 Part 2: Admixture which, without effecting the consistence, permits a reduction in the water content of a given concrete mix, or which, without affecting the water content increases the slump/flow or produces both effects simultaneously. This type of admixture improves the dispersion of cement particles resulting in an increase in workability.

## 7 Types of Concrete Chemical Admixtures and Minerals - Civil Click
To modify the concrete properties, mineral admixtures were used under the permits of IS: . Those are. 1: Fly Ash. 2: Silica Fume. 3: Rice Husk Ash. 4: Metakaoline. 5: Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag. The following materials may be added in concrete either as an admixture or as a part of cement.
