## Which method of extracting coal is safer for miners?
Longwall mining accounts for 50 percent of coal mines in the world and is much safer than other methods of coal mining. If done right, the process is much more profitable as resource recovery is dramatically improved (about 80 percent compared with about 60 percent for room-and-pillar).

## Retreat Mining, Room and pillar mining, Underground Mining, Mining 
Room and pillar mining proceed inner, away from the entrance of the mine. When the coal seam goes out or the mine's property line is reached, retreat mining is a method that recovers the supporting coal pillars, working from the back of the mine through the entrance, thus the word "retreat."

## Room And Pillar Mining - Ciner
The Room and Pillar Method, also referred to as the Pillar and Stall Method, is one of the world's oldest mining systems. Dating beyond the 1840s, this method has been commonly used in mining coal, iron, and other base metals. In the 1970s, over 50% of coal mining in the United States used this method. Today, it remains the most popular coal

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Most underground coal is mined by the room and pillar method, where by rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air.Generally, rooms are 2,000 feet wide and the pillars up to 300 feet wide. At least 60 feet of coal was left between an underground mine and the surface, if not the surface had a higher

The underground mining of coal has evolved. Most older abandoned mines were developed using room-and-pillar methods. This method involved extracting the coal first by manual excavation and later by mechanical means. After coal extraction, this method left voided areas that contained unextracted coal (i.e. pillars) to support the mine roof and

"Room and pillar is a non-subsidence plan for a mine, preserving the precious farmland above. It is among the safest and one of the most ecologically-friendly approaches to mining coal

## Method of recovering room-and-pillar coal pillar by using external 
The room-type coal pillar mining method has advantages including low production cost, high efficiency and easy management. However, the coal recovery rate is low, and the coal pillars have a risk of chained instability that may lead to disasters. Safe recovery of room-type coal pillars can improve the utilization of coal resources and prevent

## Failure Propagation of Pillars and Roof in a Room and Pillar Mine 
The experiments were conducted as follows: (1) the room and pillar method was used to form the pillar and roof system in the No. 2-2 coal; (2) the extraction was advanced in the No. 3-1 coal seam by 50 mm in each step to simulate the LW mining process, and then stopped to observe and record the roof movement and crack propagation using the camera.

Operating in a "room and pillar" (also known as "bord and pillar") system—where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30 foot (5-10 m) "rooms" or work areas cut into the coalbed—it can mine as much as five tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day.

Room-and-pillar mining. Room-and-pillar mining is the most common type of system for mining coal. In this system, the mine roof is supported mainly by coal pillars left at regular intervals. Rooms are places where the coal is mined; pillars are areas of coal left between the rooms. Room-and-pillar mining is done either by 1) conventional mining

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
There are two main methods of underground mining: room-and-pillar and longwall mining.  In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can be up to 40% of the total coal in the seam - although

## Pillar Stability Analysis for Partial Pillar Extraction. A  - OnePetro
The Room-and-pillar (R&P) method is a widely utilized underground mining method used in coal, limestone and metal mines. The basic premise is that a series of rooms (i.e., long horizontal openings) will be extracted, while leaving behind pillars of ore.

## Mining 101 - West Virginia Coal Association
Underground mining coal extraction methods can generally be divided into two categories: room and pillar mines and longwall mines. The type of extraction practiced is dictated by the characteristics of the coal seam and its related geology. Generally, longwall mining is restricted to seams with uniform geology and coal seam thickness while room
