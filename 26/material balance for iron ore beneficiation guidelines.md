## Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation | ST Equipment & Technology
Iron Ore Beneficiation. Iron ore is the fourth most common element in earth's crust. Iron is essential to steel manufacturing and therefore an essential material for global economic development. Iron is also widely used in construction and the manufacturing of vehicles. Most of iron ore resources are composed of metamorphosed banded iron

## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
Beneficiation process. Magnetite is the most important iron ore mineral. Cut-off grade is 20%, and the industrial grade is 25%. There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.

Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.
