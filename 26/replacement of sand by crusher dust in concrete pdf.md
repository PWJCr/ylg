## What are the advantages and disadvantages of stone dust in concrete 
Answer (1 of 6): Stone dust - if you are talking about the finer particles than 150 micron - it is not recommended to use in concrete. Almost everywhere, concrete is done using crush stone sand. Cement is normally passing through 90 micron. Dust have particles finer than 90 micron. Some have

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.
