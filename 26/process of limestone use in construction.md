The following are 25 most common uses of limestone; 1.) Construction and Architecture. This is the most common use of limestone. After quarrying, the limestone is sliced into slabs or blocks of predetermined sizes. These slabs and blocks can then be used for the construction of things such as sculptures, tiles, pyramids, or even stair treads. 2.)

## Algae-grown limestone could be the key to 'carbon negative' cement 
Spotted: The current process for creating portland cement—one of the world's most common building materials—consists of heating limestone to high temperatures.Today, limestone for cement production is quarried. As a result, the heating process releases carbon that would otherwise be locked away in the earth into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.

## How is Limestone Used in a Building? | Stamford Stone
Limestone is a pale-coloured stone that may appear in a number of shades when weathered. This is due to the number of sediments it contains such as clay, as well as its high fossil content. They made up of at least 50% calcite. As an architectural stone, it is popular due to its graceful ageing; the beauty of limestone is timeless.
