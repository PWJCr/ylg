## The processing of granite: Step by step - CKP
Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

## How is Granite Mined? Everything You Need to Know.
Granite slabs are attained from specific sites that are known as quarries. Normally, miners choose quarries that are as close to the surface of the earth as possible. The layers of earth above which the stones are formed are firstly removed to uncover the granite. After this, an open cast mining process is used to extract it from the earth.
