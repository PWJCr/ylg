## minimum compressive strength of hollow blocks
The minimum compressive strength shall be 75 N/mm2 for non-load-bearing block work and 125 N/mm2 for load-bearing block work, using Sulphate Resisting Cement and suitably graded fine and coarse aggregate, for use below damp-proof course level The minimum compressive strength shall be 75 N/mm2 for non-load-bearing block work

## What Is The Crushing Strength Of Brick
Strength Brick Crushing Bouwwerkendekleermaeker. strength brick crushing For ASTM C90 concrete block the assembly compressive strength only increases 250 psi when the mortar is changed from Type N to Type S from an f m of 1750 psi to 2000 psi for CMU units with 2000 psi compressive strength The compressive strength of the masonry units is the largest factor by far in masonry assembly
