## Efflorescence: Causes and Solutions - Concrete Construction
Causes. Usually, efflorescence is primarily composed of calcium carbonate formed when leached calcium hydroxide (CH) from within the concrete reacts with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. CH is one of the hydration products created by the chemical reaction between portland cement and water. It is readily soluble in water and easily leached.

It will be possible to remove some efflorescence from the surface, but more extreme cases will not be removable. Some removal tips to keep in mind: The standard removal process is through abrasion. A brush can be used to remove the less resilient crystals. Brush with added sand for extra abrasiveness, and make the sand damp for even more.

An auto scrubber or swing machine will help rinse the mineral residue from the surface. If the floor has been sealed with a topical sealer (like acrylic or clear epoxy coating), then the sealer will need to be removed to clean the surface. The efflorescence is trapped in between the concrete slab and the topical sealer.

CAUSES: A combination of circumstances causes efflorescence. First, there must be soluble salts in the material. Second, there must be moisture to dissolve soluble salts. Third, evaporation of hydrostatic pressure must cause the solution to move toward the surface. And fourth the solution must evaporate to leave salts behind as efflorescence.

Efflorescence is the result of a chemical reaction occurring in your concrete flooring. Water soluble salts combine with moisture as they move through the concrete flooring material to its surface. The result: white dust-like residue (Source: Nitterhouse Masonry Products ). Efflorescence has several causes. The two most common are the concrete

Removing Efflorescence. Most efflorescence can be removed by pressure washing with water or scrubbing with water and a brush. The water will dissolve most of the salts but must be rinsed away completely. Tougher deposits can be removed with special cleaning products.

Wind-driven rain, sprinklers, and frequent wetting and drying cycles are often the cause of efflorescence on walls. Cold and damp areas, like garages, and shady patios and walkways, are more prone to efflorescence - water evaporates more slowly allowing more salts to reach the surface.
