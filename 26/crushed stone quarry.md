Granule gravel is sub-divided into very fine and fine, while pebble gravel has three sub-categories, i.e., medium, coarse, and very coarse.

## Crushed gravel size chartngdafo
The angle of internal friction of a crushed stone will be directly influenced by type of rock and grain size . Forty-one (41) seems to me possible, but dangerous. I would use a safe 36 degrees unless a direct shear test is performed on a sample. There's at-rest earth pressure and active earth pressure.
