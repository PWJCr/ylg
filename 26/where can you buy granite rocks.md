## Buy Decomposed Granite for Your Yard - SoilDirect
The cost is about $3, which should suffice for adding decomposed granite to a location that already has this type of rock. However, if you need decomposed granite delivered at your home for a major landscaping project, buying it by cubic yard is advisable. You can purchase this material for about $35 up to $50 per cubic yard or a 3-foot cube.

## Authentic original antique Japanese garden rock, stone for sale 
In Japanese landscaping, rocks are classified as either tall vertical, low vertical, arching, reclining or flat. For creating mountain-like compositions, usually igneous volcanic rocks, rugged mountain rocks with sharp edges are used. Smooth, rounded sedimentary rocks are on the other hand used for the borders of dry rivers of gravel.
