## When should PHAs (HAZOPs, etc.) Be Performed During Major Projects?
The short answer is you need to perform PHAs in phases, from conceptual stage, through preliminary and detailed design, and then complete these during the pre-commissioning stages (as mentioned by Bryan). The PHAs build upon each other and the completion of the final phase PHA becomes the Baseline PHA. The tools used change from phase-to-phase
