## Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences
In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap. This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.

Compression crushers include jaw crushers, cone crushers, gyratory crushers and roll crushers. Impact crushers include vertical shaft impactors or horizontal shaft impactors. Compression crushers require much less maintenance; high impact crushers undergo more wear and tear due to the material colliding within the crusher.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

## Cone Crushers - SolidsWiki
A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones.A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.

The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t/h. To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher, the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier. Therefore, primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation. The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.

Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
