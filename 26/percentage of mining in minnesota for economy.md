For the United States, Mexico's mining sector represented a USD 1.25 billion market by the end of 2020. Mexican imports of U.S. minerals and ores dropped 21 percent in 2020, compared to the previous year. While COVID-19 may have played a role in this drop, Mexican imports of mined materials from the U.S., have been falling since 2016.

By the 1920s, mining had become a major player in the economy of Minnesota. A century later, iron ore takes up a large chunk of mining activities in the state. Sadly, the industry is on a gradual decline and currently accounts for a minuscule percentage of Minnesota's GDP. There are about 210 mining businesses that employ roughly 5,700 people.
