## The Unit: Seek and Destroy Mass Market Paperback
An unnecessary portrayal. But the reading is easy and each of the Unit's soldiers exhibit their skills and professionalism throughout the book. "Condition Red" situation a little cheesey; I think the author could have written a better exit strategy for the situation, one that depended on the Unit's superior soldiering and leadership skills.

## civilization beyond earth - Earliest unit needed to capture city 
1 Answer. Sorted by: 4. I've captured a city with the first infantry unit (soldier) you can get. However it would be best to use other units (especially siege units) to do most of the damage otherwise it would take a lot of the low level units to take a city as you would loose several of them.
