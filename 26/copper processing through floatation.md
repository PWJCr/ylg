A high pressure watertube boiler (also spelled water-tube and water tube) is a type of boiler in which water circulates in tubes heated externally by the fire. Fuel is burned inside the furnace, creating hot gas which boils water in the steam-generating tubes.In smaller boilers, additional generating tubes are separate in the furnace, while larger utility boilers rely on the water-filled.

## copper froth floatation
Answer. Copper is extracted from copper pyrites by froth flotation process. Froth flotation method is used to separate particles based on the differences in the ability of air bubbles to selectively attach to specific mineral surfaces in a mineral-water slurry. A finely crushed ore is suspended in water and a blast of air is passed through the

## Copper Processing: The Quest for Efficiency at Scale | E & MJ
Copper processing operations are some of the most water and energy-intensive within the mining industry that, as a whole, is responsible for 11% of worldwide energy usage, according to the World Bank's 2020 Minerals for Climate Action report.  Today, the majority of copper is produced as a concentrate through conventional flotation, with a

In this process, the property of ore minerals solubility is used. Froth floatation technique is used in primary that is un-weathered and secondary that is supergene sulphide ores to separate gangue from ore. Using simple gravity circuit, the mineral can be recovered from local copper with ore bodies that are rich in supergen copper.

##  Separating Minerals by Floatation - ABB
A high pH is important in the processing of copper ore to maximize this mineral's floatation properties. Most copper ore slurries tend to be acidic. Plants typically add lime to the slurry in the mill or floatation circuit, increasing its alkalinity. A typical copper operation contains many floatation cells, often with a pH sensor in each cell.

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper.

## Copper Processing | Multotec
Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.
