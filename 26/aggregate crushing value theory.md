## crushing strength test on aggregates
TESTING OF AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE Aggregate crushing value is an indicator of the crushing resistance of the aggregates when a compressive load is increased. It is tested in accordance with BS 812:110, 1990 and aggregate passing a 14mm test sieve and retained on 10mm sieve are considered for the testing. The allowable range is 17 41.

## Theory Aggregate Crushing
Determination Aggregate Crushing Value Theory determination of aggregate crushing value METHOD B2 THE DETERMINATION OF THE 10 PER CENT The 10 per cent Fines Aggregate Crushing Value is the force in kN required to crush a sample of -13 29 5mm aggregate so that 10 per cent of the total test sample will pass a 2 36 mm sieve.

## aggregate crushing value test for ppt
The aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of an aggregate under a gradually applied compressive load. It is a numerical index of the strength of the aggregates. This test is helpful in the construction of roads and pavements.  Theory The elongation index on an aggregate is the percentage by weight of
