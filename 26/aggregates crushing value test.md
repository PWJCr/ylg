Because aggregate, the most mined resource in the world, is nonrenewable, using RAP conserves the virgin resource itself, as well as the energy and transportation costs that go into obtaining it. In addition, using RAP greatly reduces the amount of construction debris going into landfills. Because RAP can be used again and again, it creates a cycle of asphalt reuse that optimizes.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - The Constructor
Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions

## How to Find Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure?
Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure: One of the test in which concrete material can fail is due to crushing under compressive stress. Aggregate crushing test is standardized by IS: 2386 part-IV and used to verify the crushing strength of aggregates. The aggregates should be oven dried, which can passes through 12.5mm and retained on

## Aggregate crushing value Test and Procedure
With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher, the result may be anomalous, and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead. Crushing value is strength of the aggregates against crushing load. Aggregates undergo crushing in road construction and road operation work. If it gets crushed easily then road

##  Method B1 the Determination of The Aggregate Crushing Value Scope
The aggregate crushing value (ACV) of an aggregate is the mass of material, expressed as a percentage of the test sample. which is crushed finer than a 2,36 mm sieve when a sample of aggregate passing the 13,2 mm and retained on the 9,50 mm sieve is subjected to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load of 400 kN. 2 APPARATUS 2.1 An
