## Although level 15 Smithing is required to smith iron bars, level 60 is 
The blast furnace process is primarily used in the carbothermic reduction of oxides, such as iron, zinc, and lead. Most of the iron ore bodies commercially explored consist of iron oxides. Consequently, rich iron ore and/or iron oxide pellets formed from concentrate can be added directly to a blast furnace (see Iron Production ).

## Blast Furnace Process - Steel Museum
Molten iron is produced in a blast furnace by the following steps: 1. Charge (solid iron ore, coke, and limestone) is constantly dumped into the top of the furnace. 2. A blast of hot air is blown into the furnace from the bottom. 3. Coke is the fuel that supplies additional heat, increasing the temperature of the charge. 4.

The metallic iron content of these ores ranges from approximately 30 % in the bog ores to 72 % in some hematites. All iron ores are mixed with other compounds in the earth which are undesirable in the smelting process. Beginning in the 1700s, iron ore was roasted with charcoal in open pits or enclosed kilns.

How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

Blast furnaces are used continuously and are only shut down when their brick lining needs replacing. As the mixture of iron ore, coke and limestone heats, the hot waste gases are collected and cleansed. They are then used to help heat the air blast, required if blast furnace is to reach the high temperatures needed to produce molten iron.
