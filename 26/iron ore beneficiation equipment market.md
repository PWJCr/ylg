## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology (Ⅱ)
There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## 5 Refractory Iron Ore Beneficiation Processes - Xinhai
01 Refractory siderite beneficiation method. The grade (theoretical grade) of siderite is low, only 48.02%, and it is often symbiotic with calcium, magnesium and manganese. The available beneficiation methods for this type of iron ore include gravity separation, strong magnetic separation, flotation, roasting and combined beneficiation.
