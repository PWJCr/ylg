## A Guide to Magnetic Separation | Eclipse Magnetics
A magnetic separator applies basic magnetic principles to remove ferrous based and paramagnetic metals from a range of substances including powders, granules, liquids, pellets or pastes. They are usually installed within the product stream at key HACCP or inspection points. See our guide to selecting the right Magnetic Separator.

## Agglomeration behaviour of magnetic microparticles during separation 
Jun 24, 2021A positive aspect of agglomeration, however, is that it leads to improved separation in the magnetic separation process [33, 41 - 44]. In order to be able to make statements about the agglomeration behaviour of oligo(dT) 25 -functionalized and mRNA-loaded magnetic particles, particle size distributions were determined.

## Theory of Agglomeration of Ferromagnetic Particles in Magnetic Fluids
Abstract. For some magnetic fluids, large agglomerates of magnetic particles are formed when a weak magnetic field is applied. In this paper we regard this phenomenon as a kind of gas-liquid phase

## Agglomeration behaviour of magnetic microparticles during separation 
Jun 24, 2021In contrast, no significant agglomeration was detected in the lysis/binding buffer. With regard to magnetic particle recycling, the influence of different storage and drying processes on particle size distribution was investigated. Agglomeration occurred in all process alternatives. For de-agglomeration, ultrasonic treatment was examined.
