## USA - Hydrometallurgical extraction and recovery of copper, gold 
A hydrometallurgical process for treating copper feed materials containing gold and/or silver by simultaneously leaching copper, gold and/or silver into an aqueous cyanide solution, recovering copper in metallic form by electrowinning and regenerating cyanide ions is provided, wherein high current efficiencies are achieved at high current densities and at low copper concentrations.

## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

## How Is Copper Extracted - Realonomics
How is copper extracted and from which minerals? Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels called adits to reach the ore.

Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process. The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity. With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand. Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust. Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

## copper gold extraction process
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into

## removing gold from copper? - Gold Refining & Metal Extraction Forum
Actually refining is easy, and safe, when done properly. Removing most of the lead from a copper pipe solder joint would be fairly easy. Just heat and use acid flux and a brush to brush it off then some sand paper. Separating copper and gold would not prove so easy with heat.
