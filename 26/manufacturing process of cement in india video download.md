## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

The most fundamental raw materials necessary for cement production are usually the portion of igneous rocks. The raw materials components range from lime stone, (one of the main components of cement) clay and marl or shale. With the technological evolution, the components of cement contain some supplementary components.

Initial estimates suggest that 4.3 Gt of cement were produced globally in 2020. This is a modest increase from 4.2 Gt the previous year, driven in large part by infrastructure-related stimulus projects in China. China is the largest cement producer, accounting for about 55% of global production, followed by India at 8%.

The manufacturing process of cement consists of mixing, drying and grinding of limestone, clay and silica into a composite mass (M.B. Alia, 2011). The mixture is then heated and burnt in a pre- heater and kiln to be cooled in an air-cooling system to form clinker, which is the semi-finished form.

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.
