## process of mining of lime stone - Capabuild
Limestone mining is done out in the open. Once studies show the existence of stone at the site, the extraction is made by separating the rock in quarry benches and dividing it into blocks. Before beginning the quarrying process, a resource analysis is made.

## Limestone Treatment of Acid Mine Drainage
The cheapest small particle size material in mining areas is "rock dust" of which 60 to 70 percent passes a 200 mesh. To obtain a smaller size, a cost in excess of that paid for lime may be required.  This process may have a cost advantage over lime alone and the desired sludge characteristics of the limestone process. Holland, et al

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
