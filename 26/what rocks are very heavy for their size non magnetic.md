Miniature horses are herd animals and take comfort in having at least one other horse friend, so keep that in mind if you are thinking of housing your newly adopted Miniature horse on your own property.Horses are also grazing animals that naturally will walk on average 20 miles a day. The tasks or work the animal does must be directly related to the person's disability.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed. WW2 expedited the development of this machinery, and crushed stone began to be widely used in construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s.

Iron-rich sedimentary rocks are sedimentary rocks which contain 15 wt.% or more iron.However, most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees. The majority of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3800 to 539 million years ago), the early Paleozoic (539 to 419 million years ago), and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago).

## I think I found a meteorite. How can I tell for sure?
Meteorites are fragments of rock or metal that fall to Earth from space. They are very rare, but many people find unusual rocks or pieces of metal and wonder if they might have found a meteorite. Meteorites have several properties that help distinguish them from other rocks: Density: Meteorites are usually quite heavy for their size, since they contain metallic iron and dense minerals.

One of the Earth's softest minerals, graphite will easily leave marks on paper, which is why it is used for fine artist pencils. Even modern pencil 'lead' is composed of graphite mixed with clay. Paradoxically, even though graphite is

## What's as dense as lead but non magnetic? This odd rock I found.
It looks like a chert nodule, which is very possible in carbonate territory. If this is chert, a chunk the size of a 2 liter bottle should weigh about 11.5 pounds - that seems the right ballpark for your rock. If it was really the density of lead, a 2-liter sized chunk would weigh almost 70 pounds. So I vote for chert.

## A mixture contains three different substances, X, Y and Z. They are of 
A very large quantity of mixture contains tiny particles of three different substances X, Y, and Z. They are of the same size, cubical in shape and yellow in colour. X particles are very heavy, insoluble, non-magnetic and contribute to 50% of the mixture. Y particles are very light, insoluble, non-magnetic and contribute to 40% of the mixture.
