Metallurgical Tests by Size. Hibbing Taconite production pellets were separated into the major screen fractions and evaluated, Table 2. Pellet size had no affect on swelling, but reducibility increased as the pellets got smaller. Figure 3 shows a direct relationship between reducibility and a ratio of pellet area to volume.

What is the smallest soil particle size? Clay Particles Clay is the smallest soil particle. If blown up to an easily visible size, compared to other soil particles, a clay particle would be the size of a golf ball. Soils classified as clay typically contain zero to 45 percent sand, zero to 45 percent silt and 50 to 100 percent clay by volume.
