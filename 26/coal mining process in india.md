2. Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

## Coal Sector in India - Drishti IAS
History of Coal Mining in India. India has a long history of commercial coal mining covering nearly 220 years starting from 1774 by M/s Sumner and Heatly of East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of river Damodar.; However, for about a century the growth of Indian coal mining remained sluggish for want of demand but the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853

## Toxic chemicals from theiddelburgelectro
Toxic chemicals from the mining process have been known to leak into water supplies. Researchers in Nevada found that fish as far as 150 miles downstream were being impacted by mining operations.Lithium-ion batteries also need a lot of cobalt - typically around 14kg per car battery.Extracting this is dirty and dangerous.

Primarily, there are two types of mining methods being used for the extraction of minerals and ores - surface/opencast mining and underground mining. The choice of method is largely determined by factors such as depth, geology of the mineral deposit and the cost of equipment. In India, surface mining is more prevalent, producing most of the
