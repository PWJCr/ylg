Bryophytes are also called amphibians of the plant kingdom because these plants can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities. They play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil. The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae.

Well, it is a combination of gold and silver that can occur in nature, an alloy also known as electrum. The green tint in this form of gold is very subtle, meaning only a trained eye would be able to spot it quickly. A weakness of green gold is that alloying gold and silver gives it an interesting color, but it does not make it stronger.
