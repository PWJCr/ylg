## Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working Principle, Operation 
A grinding machine is a production machine tool used in the manufacturing industry in which the grinding wheel is attached in the tool post and the workpiece is fixed to the work table and when the operation starts it removes the unwanted material to get the desired surface finish, correct size, and accurate shape of the workpiece.

Multiple grinding wheels can be used (each with a different form, abrasive grit size or bond) to rough grind, finish grind, and polish—all in one setup. For example, multiple ODs can be ground, then the machine can switch to a different spindle by using a turret and precision Hirth coupling to auto index 0 to 180 degrees, thereby enabling an

Maybe it is not strong enough to push the collar because it is not getting a full vacuum. Check the actuator itself and make sure it will hold a vacuum, that it is not leaking. You engage the 4wd by pulling back on the transfer case stick. That will activate the actuator on the front axle and the front axle will engage.

Or if you are driving with the hubs unlocked and you hear the noise, you should be able to kick the transfer case into 4wd and the noise will go away. If this is not the case then you are probably dealing with a different problem.

## Toyota Prius growling or grinding noise from front wheels  - CARspec
 Toyota Prius vehicles can be prone to a growling or grinding noise from the front wheels, a noise that gets louder with speed or worse when turning. The most likely cause outside of a brake concern (meaning brakes that are worn to the point of abnormal noise like metal on metal contact) is excessive wear of the front wheel bearings.

## Grinding noise after wheel bearing installed - 2CarPros
I recently had a vibration in the front end (vibration meaning grinding). I took it to a mechanic as I no longer possess a hydrolic press and my friend also operates a machine shop. So, after installing the wheel bearing I reassembled the spindle and strut, lower ball joint, half shaft and tie rod end. The grinding reappeared three miles down

## Help, scraping/grinding noise coming from front drivers side!
Well I was able to work on my Trailblazer this past weekend. I changed all 4 rotors, all sets of brake pads, and I solved the grinding noise. I noticed right away when I removed my drivers side wheel that my tie rod end was shot. I replaced, got an alignment, and the noise is no longer.

RoverGuy7. Actually the front fluid is called for change at 150k, but yeah, do it every 75. Usual cause of an intermitent noise is the hub bearing being loose, turning the wheel can somewhat reseat the bearing, and the noise will go away. Check it before you drive much more, as complete failure is a very bad thing.
