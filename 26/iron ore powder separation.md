## separation of iron ore from copper ore
Copper processing Ores Britannica. Extraction and refining. The extraction of copper from ore is normally carried out in three major steps. The first step, mineral processing, is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituentssuch as alumina, limestone, pyrite, and silicaso that the copper minerals and other nonferrous minerals of value are concentrated into a product containing

Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process!  During pelletizing, ore powder is rolled into iron ore green pellets in rotating drums together with water, binding agents and additives. Globules with grain sizes of approx. 15 mm are produced, which are then baked
