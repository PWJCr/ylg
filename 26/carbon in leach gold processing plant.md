## Carbon Adsorption In Recovery Of Gold - Mine Engineer.Com
The gold adsorbs onto the surface of the carbon. The loaded carbon is periodically removed from the columns, and sent to the stripping circuit. The carbon is then generally subjected to a heated solution (200 deg to 250 deg F) of (1%) sodium hydroxide and (0.1%) cyanide and the gold is re-dissolved and removed from the carbon surface.

## Gold Leaching | Carbon in Leach - JXSC Machine
Gold Leaching ( carbon in leach) was developed from CIP ( Carbon In Pulp), is characterized by less process flow, timesaver in the leaching process, thus reducing the production expenditure. Besides, advanced extraction technology improving the efficiency of gold extraction. The CIL production line is wider use than CIP in the mineral industry.

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.2-0.5 µm of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach. For large gold particles and nuggets, this is too slow to be fully dissolved in a typical processing plant. Much simpler and less expensive gravity methods are available to recover this gold.

ENGLISH SUMMARY: Carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuits have been the primary methods used for treating gold ores for many years. Although inherently robust processes, there is still often much room for optimisation to improve gold extraction efficiencies and to reduce reagent consumption and operating costs.

## Estimation of gold inventory in large carbon in leach tanks
Approximately 50% of the total gold processed by the plant gold is dissolved and recovered onto the carbon. Each tank is charged with a target concentration of 15.0 g/L of carbon. Gold that dissolves from the ore is continuously adsorbed onto the activated carbon. The discharge of the last tank flows to the tailings ponds.
