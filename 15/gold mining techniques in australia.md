## Gold Rush: : Mining Techniques | Picture This
The change in mining techniques is really the story of the evolution of the Gold Rush from an individual to a corporate phenomenon. A few years after 1849, when hydraulic jets were the main mode of mining, an individual could no longer go to California to "strike it rich." Large corporations essentially ruled the Gold Rush and literally had the

The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as doré - typically containing between 60-90% gold. During its life, a number of factors - such as the

## Gold diggers - Earth Resources
Early mining methods involved human labour and water to free gold from clay and soil. A diggers' toolkit included a wide tin pan, pick axes, spades, shovels, a wheelbarrow, felling axes, trowels, iron wedges, crowbars, metal buckets and a cradle. Miners purchased these tools from store keepers or exhausted diggers leaving the goldfields.

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

Cut and Fill Mining: It is one of the most utilised mining methods in the industry, which relies on a simple cutting of the ore, excavation and filling. The ore is cut into different sections and removed via controlled detonations. The voids created by the detonations are filled usually with waste rock/tailings or cement.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Underground Mining in Australia & Primary Methods
Aug 9, 2021Cut and Fill Mining: It is one of the most utilised mining methods in the industry, which relies on a simple cutting of the ore, excavation and filling. The ore is cut into different sections and removed via controlled detonations. The voids created by the detonations are filled usually with waste rock/tailings or cement.
