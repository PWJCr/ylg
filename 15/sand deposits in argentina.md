According to state-run company YPF, which recently announced plans for significant investment in the Vaca Muerta, the development of even a small portion of the deposit, which is about 30,000 km2, would be enough to alleviate the country's energy deficit. But part of successfully developing the Vaca Muerta relies on an economic source of sand.

## Emphasis on the economical aspects of the glass sand deposits 
The sandstones that crop out below the marine Cenomanian beds are represented by stratified beds. Kerdany and Cherif ( 1990) suggested that the Malha Formation is made up of river deposits that carried clastic materials during a low stand of sea-level from the positive areas.

Sand and gravel resources in the Lake Erie basin are generally restricted to nearshore littoral deposits and offshore glacial moraines. A survey to explore for sub-surface sand deposits in western Lake Erie (Fig. 1) has revealed an extensive formation of well-sorted sand, presumably deposited as a delta at the mouth of the an-cestral Detroit River.

SANDSTONE DEPOSITS The silica bearing sandstone must be mined or quarried much in the manner for handling hard rock. The mined ore is reduced by a Jaw Crusher to about 1″ size for the average small tonnage operation. For larger scale operations two-stage crushing is advisable. The crushed ore is reduced to natural sand grain size by Rod Milling.

## Sand and sand mining - Michigan State University
In Michigan, there are three important dune areas where industrial sand is mined. These are 1) inland dunes, 2) coastal dunes, and 3) coastal sand strips. A mineral resource with similar characteristics to dune sand is sandstone; the Paleozoic Sylvania sandstone is mined in only one very limited area of the state.

## Gold in placer deposits | U.S. Geological Survey
The Seward Peninsula has produced more than 6 million ounces of placer gold, including about 4,000,000 ounces from the Nome district. Most of the gold was derived from raised beach deposits. Source of the gold probably is Tertiary-mineralized faults and joints in metamorphic rocks of late Precambrian age.
