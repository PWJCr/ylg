Asphalt plant process flow - Batch and continuous plants. Continuous asphalt plant process flow. The starting point of the asphalt drum mix plant process is the continuous feeding of cold aggregates into the feeder bins. Aggregates have to be fed as per the size into different feeder bins. The number of bins are three, four or even more.
