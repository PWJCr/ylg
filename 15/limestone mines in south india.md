## Crucible steel
Methods of crucible steel production. Iron alloys are most broadly divided by their carbon content: cast iron has 2-4% carbon impurities; wrought iron oxidizes away most of its carbon, to less than 0.1%. The much more valuable steel has a delicately intermediate carbon fraction, and its material properties range according to the carbon percentage: high carbon steel is stronger but more
