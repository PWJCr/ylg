These findings were consistent with a growing body of evidence that iron concentration is considered a driving factor in the induction of ferroptosis and that iron-dependent ferroptosis is implicated in the pathological process of many fibrosis-related diseases (Fang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020a; Tadokoro et al., 2020).

The cast iron is usually extracted from its oxide ore (haematite). This process involves the following steps: 1) Concentration. The ore is crushed in jaw crushers and is broken to small pieces of about 1 inch in size. The crushed ore is concentrated by gravity separation process in which it is washed with water to remove clay, sand, etc.

## IRON PROBLEMS | American Ground Water Trust
The first step in solving an iron problem is to determine if the iron is in particle form (oxidized state) or dissolved (reduced state). The color of the water is a good initial clue for the presence of oxidized iron. Iron that is oxidized forms small "rust" particles that can give the water running out of a faucet a red, brown or yellow color.

## Physiology of Iron Metabolism - PMC - PubMed Central (PMC)
Iron metabolism is finely regulated. Males contain about 4,000 mg of iron, of which 2,500 mg is within erythrocytes; 1,000 mg is stored in splenic and hepatic macrophages, and the rest is distributed in various proteins such as myoglobin, cytochromes or other ferroproteins.
