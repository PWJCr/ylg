For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

Excavators are brought in for big, messy jobs like demolition or dredging a river. They are, of course, also relied on for excavating foundations, as well as holes and trenches. The excavator is a vital piece of equipment in the mining and metals industry, and is used across industries for tasks such as installing pipes and moving heavy materials.
