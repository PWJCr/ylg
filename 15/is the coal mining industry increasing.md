## History of coal mining
The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years, with early mines documented in ancient China, the Roman Empire and other early historical economies. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today

Iron ore, coal, potassium, and copper are the most exploited commodities in terms of volume. The top three coal-producing countries are China, Indonesia, and India.  According to mining industry trends in 2021, the increase is primarily due to companies reorganizing their operations and recovering from the impact of COVID-19.

Oct 8, 2021T he price of coal has exploded this year as worldwide demand has surged, but mining operations in the United States are struggling to keep up. The price of central Appalachia coal averaged $73.25 per short ton, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's most recent report. That is an increase of $2.20 from the week before, $7.

## Mining industry increasing production | Rubber News
Feb 25, 2022Coal mining. U.S. coal production increased 8 percent in 2021, driven by increased demand due to rising natural gas prices. Coal's comparatively lower prices made it more economical for use in electric power generation compared with natural gas, according to the EIA. In 2020, U.S. coal production fell to its lowest level since 1964.

## Why is the demand for coal in the world always increasing?
The coal mining industry appeared relatively early and developed from the second half of the nineteenth century. Coal mining output varies widely between periods, between regions and countries, but in general, there is a tendency to increase in absolute numbers. In the past 50 years, the average growth rate was 5.4% / year, the highest rate in the 1950s and 1980s was 7% / year.

Why mining should be stopped? Mining activities increase the volume and rate of exposure of sulfur-containing rocks to air and water, creating sulfuric acid and dissolved iron.This acid run-off dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead and mercury which leach into ground water aquifers and surface water sources, harming humans and wildlife.
