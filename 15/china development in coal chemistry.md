## Coal in China
China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. It is also the largest user of coal-generated electricity, with over a thousand coal-fired power stations. The share of coal in the energy mix declined during the 2010s, falling from 80% in 2010 to 58% in 2019.

China remains the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. The proportion of coal in the diversified Chinese energy structure has been declining gradually year by year, but the characteristics of China's energy resources and development status indicate that the dominant position of coal in primary energy production and consumption would not change for a long period time.

## China suspends coal-to-oil projects | News | Chemistry World
China suspends coal-to-oil projects. Just two plants escape the Chinese ban on converting coal into liquid fuels. China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has banned the practice of converting coal to liquid fuels (CTL). But experts say that the move is unlikely to damage China's expanding coal-to-chemicals industry.

## Coal chemical industry and its sustainable development in China
The coal chemical industry will play an important role in the sustainable development of China's energy resources in the next twenty years, which will alleviate environmental pollution and reduce this country's dependence on oil imports. In a word, there will be great demand and opportunities for the coal chemical industry in China.

## Coal power transition in China: A discussion paper | Ember
The main purpose of this report is to review the development of coal power in China during the 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period (), focusing on its underlying drivers, as well as to identify possible policy entry points to shift the future trajectory of coal power development (i.e., mid-steps between goals and mixes of policy instruments for achieving the goals).
