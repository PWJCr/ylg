## A laboratory study of the pollution of formaldehyde in cemeteries 
The main sources of pollution from cemeteries are (1) human bodies; (2) embalming fluids, which primarily contain formaldehyde (Guttman et al. 2012); and (3) the fabrication materials of coffins, which may contain harmful and toxic metals that could seep into the soil (Jonker and Olivier 2012). The pollution potential of cemeteries has received increasing attention over the past few years.
