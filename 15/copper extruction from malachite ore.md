Copper can be extracted from its ores by reduction. One of the common copper ores, malachite, which is composed of mainly copper carbonate, CuCO3xCu(OH)2, is heated to produce copper oxide with the release of carbon dioxide. CuCO3xCu(OH)2 → 2 CuO + CO2 + H2O The copper oxide is then heated with carbon to get copper. 2 CuO + C → 2 Cu + CO2

## copper extraction from ore malachite
leaching of malachite ore in ammonium sulfate solutions and the copper from the ore. however, malachite ores often contain high levels of contaminants depending on the ore source, such as fe, zn, al, pb, silica, and various clay minerals. therefore, when sulfuric acid is employed as lixiviant to extract copper from the ore, other metals in the ore matrix are also dissolved together with the

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Copper extraction from malachite - Rdsto Mining Machinery
Copper extraction from malachite. Copper can be extracted from its ores by reduction. One of the common copper ores, malachite, which is composed of mainly copper carbonate, CuCO3 Cu (OH)2, is heated to produce copper oxide with the release of carbon dioxide. The final product is between 99.94 and 99.96% Cu. contact us get quote
