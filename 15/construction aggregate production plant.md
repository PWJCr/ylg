Introduction. The aggregate production industry is a fundamental contributor to the infrastructure and construction sector by providing building materials for road, railways, housing construction, etc. Aggregates production processes are driven by market needs which however may fluctuate during a year, e.g. for the Swedish market, the demand for aggregates varies between summer and winter season.

Aggregate production dates back to the Roman Empire, and it has been critical to the growth of our world ever since. Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up over 90% of an asphalt pavement and up to 80% of a concrete mix.

Water-to-Cement Ratio and Aggregate Moisture Corrections. If the coarse aggregate has a moisture content of 1.5% we will instead need to batch about 1946 pounds of coarse aggregate per cubic yard of concrete (1917 lb/yd3  1.015 = 1946 lb/yd3). Similar calculations also apply to fine aggregate moisture adjustments.

HMA production is the first step in construction. The basic purpose of an HMA plant is to properly proportion, blend, and heat aggregate and asphalt to produce an HMA that meets the requirements of the job mix formula (JMF) (Roberts et al., 1996). There are two basic types of HMA plants commonly in use today: the batch plant, and the drum mix

## Construction Aggregate Crushing Plant - DSMAC
DSMAC is a premier supplier of crushing and screening equipment, and related auxiliary equipment in China. We provide complete crushers and screen machines for producing all types of aggregate. One unit of DSMAC aggregate production line can produce up to TPH, the grain size will be 0-5mm, 5-10 mm, 10-20mm, 20-40mm, 40-60mm and even

## Configuration and design of 1000tph limestone aggregate production plant
In order to facilitate the subsequent quantitative explanation, we take an existing limestone mine in a cement factory as the background. The processing capacity of the production line is 1000t/h, 10% of the soil is removed, and the finished aggregate product is 20-31.5mm, 18%; 10-20 mm, 25%; 5-10 mm, 17%; 0-5 mm, 25%.
