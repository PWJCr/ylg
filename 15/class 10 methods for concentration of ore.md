## Metallurgy Meaning, Concentration of ore Preparation & Methods - Aakash
Naturally, ores come along with a lot of impurities mixed with the mineral. The process of removing these impurities is known as dressing. It is also known as the concentration of ore. This helps increase the concentration of the metal present in the mineral ore. The concentration of ore can be carried out in two methods: 1. Physical methods

## what is froth flotation process for class 10
The Froth Floatation method is a method used for the concentration of metal ores. It is used for the concentration of sulphide ores. In this method, water is added to powdered ore. To this, substances called collectors (such as pine oil ) are added so that the ore particles can be separated from the gangue particles.

Haematite ore is a combination of Iron and oxide and also it is a heavy mineral oxide. Hence, gravity separation is used. ‚à¥ Haematite ore is concentrated by "Gravity separation method". The correct option is (A). Note: Carbonate ores can also be concentrated by gravity separation methods. It is also called hydraulic washing.

In this method the ore is soaked in a particular solution for long time. The ore dissolves in that solution due to specific chemical reaction. The gangue, however, does not react and therefore does not dissolve in that solution. It can be separated easily. For example, concentration of bauxite, the aluminium ore, is done by leaching method.

The concentration of ores is the first step in the extraction of metals. Ores Concentration There are a lot of contaminants in the ores that need to be filtered out. Concentration is the filtering of these contaminants from ores. Gravity separation, hydraulic washings, and the froth flotation process are all options for concentration.
