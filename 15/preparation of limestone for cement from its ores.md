Answer (1 of 2): Of course not. It's one of the most common rocks in the Earth's crust. We would have to mine out most of the historical seabeds that have ever existed in Earth's history since multicellular life began. That's functionally impossible. Even if we were to get rid of current shallow-

The composition of cement determines its performance. cement is produced by heating various materials including chalk or marl, shells, and limestone combined with clay, shale, blast furnace slag, slate, iron ore, and silica sand. the outcome is a powder that mainly contains oxides of silicon, calcium, magnesium, iron, aluminum and other trace.

Blast furnaces produce pig iron from iron ore by the reducing action of carbon (supplied as coke) at a high temperature in the presence of a fluxing agent such as limestone.Ironmaking blast furnaces consist of several zones: a crucible-shaped hearth at the bottom of the furnace; an intermediate zone called a bosh between the hearth and the stack; a vertical shaft (the stack) that extends from

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

The hardness of marl is lower than the hardness of limestone The more clay substances, the lower its hardness. This is an excellent raw material for cement production. Each of these materials has different grinding

## Raw materials for cement manufacturing - Cement Plant Optimization
Lime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominantly fine grained crystalline structure, its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2. To 2.8. Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron compounds, which influences its color.
