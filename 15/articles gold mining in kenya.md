## Artisanal gold‐mining in a rural environment: Land degradation in Kenya 
Artisanal gold-mining (AGM) is one of the most important activities in the districts of Migori and Transmara (Kenya). Gold-mining, however, is known to release vast quantities of arsenic and metals (some of which are very toxic like As, Hg, Cd, or Pb), which poses a serious threat to not only miners but also to the ecosystem and local populations.

This work considered the environmental impact of artisanal mining gold activity in the Migori-Transmara area (Kenya). From artisanal gold mining, mercury is released to the environment, thus contributing to degradation of soil and water bodies.
