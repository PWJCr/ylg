## Chemical Beneficiation of Phosphate Rock | E & MJ
By Dr. Fathi Habashi. Figure 1—Typical phosphate losses in Florida. Great effort is spent by the phosphate industry to beneficiate the rock to obtain a concentrate containing 30%-31% P 2 O 5 . [1] During this process, much of the phosphate values are lost to the tailings stream. For example, to obtain 1 ton of rock containing 31% P 2 O 5
