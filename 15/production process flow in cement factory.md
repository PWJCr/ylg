## Cement
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Manufacture of cement - consists of mixing, burning, and grinding processes. 1. Mixing: It may be a wet process or by dry process. In a wet process wash mill is used which is a heavy cylinder of 2.5 to 3.0 m in diameter and 9 to 12 m in length. It is kept slightly inclined to the horizontal and can rotate at 15-20 revolutions per minute.

## Analysis of material flow and consumption in cement production process 
The LN cement plant, located in the south-west of Shandong Province, was considered as a case study for the mass flow and balance analysis. This cement plant operates on a dry process line with a five-stage suspension pre-heater and an inline pre-calciner. The kiln is 4 m in diameter and 60 m in length.
