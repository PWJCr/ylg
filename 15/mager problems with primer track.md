Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys.Each pair consists of a public key (which may be known to others) and a private key (which may not be known by anyone except the owner). The generation of such key pairs depends on cryptographic algorithms which are based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.

## PCR Troubleshooting | Bio-Rad
Using too few PCR cycles can lead to insufficient amplification. Use 20-35 cycles. Use fewer cycles when template concentration is high, and use more cycles when template concentration is low. Extension time was too short. If the extension time is too short, there will be insufficient time for complete replication of the target.

## Need help: SP Primers flipping in primer cup/550
The problem is, the 550 spills decapping residue on the end of the primer slide bearing. The slide then spreads the residue out and eventually wears tracks through the surface coating of the bearing. Then the primer slide starts sticking and jerking. I had a friend who does some metal work make one of these for me.
