## Gyratory VS Jaw Crushers: Advantages & Disadvantages
The jaw crusher will handle sticky,'or dirty feed better than the gyratory, there being no diaphragm below the crushing chamber on which such material can pack. Routine maintenance and repair jobs are generally more easily accomplished on the jaw crusher than on the gyratory. Major repairs are about a stand-off.

## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The capacity of jaw crushers is a measure of the mass or volume of crushed material produced in unit time of operation. The capacity is primarily a function of: 1. crusher design characteristics such as width and depth of the crushing chamber, 2. open and closed side settings, 3.

## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
The gap between the jaws becomes narrower farther down into the crusher. As the moveable jaw pushes against the stone in the chamber, the stone is fractured and reduced, moving down the chamber to the opening at the bottom. The reduction ratio for a jaw crusher is typically 6-to-1, although it can be as high as 8-to-1.

## how a jaw crusher works and what it is used for
A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.

The crusher contains a certain amount of hammers that are pinned to the rotor disk and the hammers are swinging to the edges because of centrifugal force. The feed is dropped to the crusher from the top of the casing and it is crushed between the casing and the hammers. After crushing the material falls through from the opening at the bottom.

Due to the rubbing action of both the vertical and horizontal components of the jaw, the plate wear is accelerated and the power efficiency is lowered. This motion does give an advantage when handling sticky materials where a DT jaw crusher would not do well as its motion is perpendicular to the fixed plate.
