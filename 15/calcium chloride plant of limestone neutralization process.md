In water at neutral pH, the predominant form of bromine is hypobromous acid (HOBr). Above pH 8.7 and at 25⬚C, the hypobromite ion (OBr⫺) is the major form of bromine. At lower pH values (below 6), Br2, Br3, bromine chloride, and other halide complexes form. Bromine and bromine chloride react with basic nitrogen compounds to from bromamines.
