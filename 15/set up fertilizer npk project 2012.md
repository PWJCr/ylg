## What Is NPK in Fertilizer and Why Does It Matter?
What are NPK Fertilizers. NPK stands for "nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium"— the three nutrients that make up NPK fertilizers, and it's one of the first things you'll notice on fertilizer packets.

Apply a slow-release fertilizer to your plants— it is less likely to cause any harm. Analysis Numbers Fertilizers with high analysis numbers can be used in lesser quantities than the ones carrying lower value concentrations. In other words, five pounds of fertilizer equals ten pounds of 5-10-5 fertilizer in terms of nutrient value.
