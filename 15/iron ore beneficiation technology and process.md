## Characteristics Of Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology | STET
Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology. Within dry iron ore separation, there are a few techniques that can be used. They include gravity separation, dry magnetic separation, and STET dry electrostatic separation. Gravity Separation is largely dependent on how well the crushing and sizing portion of the process went. With this technique, gravity

There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

The process uses coal gas for pre-heating & for partial reduction. Hematite / limonite / goethite ores get converted into magnetite ore in 1-10 minutes depending on the size of iron ore, at temperatures of degree C. The left-over heat, after reduction, is utilized for 3 stage pre-heating of iron ore.
