## Prediction of fuel consumption of mining dump trucks: A neural networks 
Thus, prediction of fuel consumption for mining dump trucks is a viable tool for both cost and GHG reduction in surface mining. Cyclic activities determine the amount of fuel consumed per cycle of dump truck's operation. A feed-forward neural network with back-propagation algorithm was used to predict the fuel consumption per cycle.

## How to Effectively Reduce Dump Truck Fuel Consumption - TruxNow
By using a trailer skirt, you can expect to save 1 to 5% on fuel. You can attach disks on wheels to better withstand aerodynamic drag around the tires. These optimize aerodynamics for fuel savings and minimizes the need for maintenance. If you spec your aerodynamic devices, you can potentially see a 1-10% reduction in dump truck fuel consumption.
