## 9 Important Problems faced by Coal Mining in India - World's Largest 
The coal dust in the mines and near the pit-heads creates environmental pollution, adversely affecting the miners and their families. vii. The burning of coal in factories and thermal plants releases many toxic gases in the atmosphere. The safety measures are expensive. viii.

## What Is the Environmental Impact of Mining and Burning Coal?
Coal is composed almost entirely of carbon, so burning coal unleashes large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into the atmosphere. These emissions have been shown to increase the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere and lead to global warming. Subsurface coal mining is dangerous. Coal is often mined in subsurface mines, which may collapse and

## 12 Environmental Effects of Coal Mining - Environment 911
Possibly one of the scariest environmental effects of coal mining is the threat of acid rain. The high acidity of AMD remains in the water supply even through evaporation and condensation, which enables it to stay in the atmosphere and eventually return in the form of "acid rain," thus perpetuating the cycle of pollution. #2 Radiation

The destruction of vegetation and soils when land is cleared for mining results in the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Another important consideration relates to the quantity of greenhouse gases released per unit mass of mined material, as some less concentrated mineral deposits require proportionally higher energy usage.

4 Conclusion. Mining has a tremendous impact on the economic, social, and environmental fabric of the surrounding area. Mining activities contribute to economic development in the area, but they also degrade the land, causing ecological and socio-economic issues. Mining harms the ecology as a whole.

## Environmental issues from coal mining and their solutions
Mining ten thousand tons of raw coal will result in 0.2 hectares of subsiding land in China. Land subsidence not only reduces crop production but also causes other environmental problems, such as utility failures, plant death, surface fracture and soil loss, drainage system failure, building damage and so on.
