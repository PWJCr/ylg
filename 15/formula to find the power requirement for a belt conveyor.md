The primary equation for Effective Tension, Te, is as follows: Te = LKt (Kx + KyWb + 0.015Wb) + Wm (LKy + H) + Tp + Tam + Tac. The Rulmeca Power Calculation Program will enable you to: Calculate Belt Conveyor Power Requirements.

Belt Pull = Total Weight x frictional coefficient. Belt Pull = 280 lbs x 0.5. Belt Pull = 140 lbs. Then, convert this to required power. Required Power = Belt Pull x Belt Speed. Required Power = 140 lbs x 50 fpm = 7,000 ft-lbs/min. Convert that to a useful unit of measure. One horsepower (HP) equals 33,000 ft-lbs/min.

## how to calculate power requirement for screw conveyor
The formula can also be used to roughly check the capacity of an existing screw conveyor power calculation. The driving power of the loaded screw conveyor is given by: P = PH + PN + Pst Where, P H = Power necessary for the progress of the material P N = Driving power of the screw conveyor at no load.
