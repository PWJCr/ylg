Hence impact crushers are not recommended for use on ores containing over 15% silica (Lewis et al., 1976). However, they are a good choice for primary crushing when high reduction ratios are required (the ratio can be as high as 40:1) and the ore is relatively non-abrasive. 6.5.3 Vertical Shaft Impact (VSI) CrushersBarmac Vertical Shaft Impact

Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule, jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept.
