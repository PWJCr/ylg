Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## What is the Beneficiation Process?
The beneficiation process can be defined as a treatment process of ore which results in a more concentrated form of the product. It is often used in the preparation of iron ore for smelting. This is an essential process as it helps improve the yield from a deposit of ore, thereby increasing the potential profits that can be obtained from the

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
Several methods/techniques such as jigging, washing, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are being used to enhance the iron percentage in the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content. These techniques are used in various combinations for the beneficiation of iron ores. Iron ore is normally beneficiated utilizing the
