## Characteristics and Comparison of Four Types of Jaw Crushers
The universal jaw crusher combines the principles of both Black and Dodge jaw crushers. The pivot is slightly above the bottom end of the movable jaw and therefore it provides two strokes per revolution.  it will generate aggressive force feed action to reduce the size of material. can crusher material with different hardness Outstanding

Jaw Crusher Operation Principle. The jaw crusher is the main component of the crushing plant. It incorporates an electrical motor to dive a rotating shaft that throws the stones and rocks. Inside the chassis of the machine, there are two or tree impact plates where the rocks and stones impact and are broken to obtain smaller parts.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has, basically, two shafts and two toggle plates.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - StudiousGuy
Working Principle of a Jaw Crusher. A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces.
