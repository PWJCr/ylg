Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments.  Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining. Some underground mines do exist, but, wherever possible, surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.  Concentration refers to the methods of producing ore fractions

Present Practice and State of Development. The largest development in the iron-ore industry, using magnetic concentration, is at the plants of Witherbee, Sherman & Co. at Mineville, N. Y., where about 1,200,000 tons of crude ore were mined and separated in 1916. The dry process of separation is used.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Reuse of iron ore mineral wastes in civil engineering constructions: A 
Approximately 18,000 ha of land is currently under mining operations in Goa (Kumar, 2000).The present mining rate of 16-21 million ton of ore, with high ore-over burden ratio of around 1:3, means that there is a need of removal and disposal of 40-50 million m 3 of waste per year. Having exhausted the available area for waste dumps within leasehold area, the mining companies had to procure
