The CSS effect on gradation is as it becomes smaller the gradation gets finer, see Figure 6. Figure 6. Crusher operated on 16 mm, 18 mm, and 20 mm (from left to right curve). In addition to finer gradation the capacity will also decrease. If you remember that the size of the choke zone determines the capacity.
