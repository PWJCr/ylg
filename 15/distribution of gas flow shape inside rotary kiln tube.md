Within a rotary kiln heat can be transferred by conduction, convection and radiation, from gas to wall, gas to bed and wall to bed. The mechanism whereby the gas heats, by direct contact, the exposed wall of the kiln, which then rotates to be under the bed and thereby heats it, is sometimes referred to as regenerative heat transfer.

The rotary kiln is a long tube that is positioned at an angle near horizontal and is rotated. The angle and the rotation allow solid reactants to work their way down the tube. Speed and angle dictate the retention time in the kiln. Gas is passed through the tube countercurrent to the solid reactant.
