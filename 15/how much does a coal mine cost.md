This coalbed methane must be vented out of mines to make mines safer places to work. In 2019, methane emissions from coal mining and abandoned coal mines accounted for about 8% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 1% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (based on global warming potential). Some mines capture and use or sell the coalbed
