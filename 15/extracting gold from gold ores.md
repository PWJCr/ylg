With ores of higher gold content (i.e., greater than 20 grams of gold per ton of ore), cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching, which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent for several hours in large tanks equipped with agitators. For extracting gold from low-grade ores, heap leaching is practiced.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Ammonia extraction of gold and silver from ores and other materials 
Abstract: Gold and silver are extracted from their elemental state or from complex ores and alloys by leaching them with a solution containing ammonia, ammonium salts and one or more oxidants. The process is particularly effective for refractory gold ores including sulfide and carbonaceous ores.

Step 6. Shake to Reveal the Gold. When the mining pan is fully submerged, shake it until you see the gold resting at the pan's bottom. While you do this, you will see the other particles start to drift away from the pan, mixing with the water. This makes it easy to see the gold better. Lift the pan out and remove any clear gold piece you see.

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam.

## Gold Extraction Process Methods Summary - JXSC Machine
In this paper, I will detail the methods of the gold extraction process, including gravity separation, flotation, cyanidation, and amalgamation.. The content of gold in the ore is extremely low. In order to extract gold, we need to crush the large ore rock into small pieces first, grind it, and then use appropriate gold processing methods to separate the gold from the ore, get the gold

## Gold Processing Methods & Gold Ore Extraction
Whole-of-ore CIL extracted between 28 and 79 percent of the gold in feed, with an average of about 61 percent. These results would indicate there is some degree of refractory gold, which would require alternative processing to recover.  Here, the gold extraction method selected was gravity/flotation as the flowsheet to pursue. by David

## Easy Ways to Extract Gold from a Rock (with Pictures) - wikiHow
May 20, 2022Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.
