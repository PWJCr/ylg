## About Sioux Quartzite | Sioux Quartzite
About Sioux Quartzite. Quartzite is a metamorphic rock formed from layers of small to medium rounded grains of quartz that have been cemented together by silica, it is so strong that it breaks across the grain instead of around it. Quartzite is between 1.6 and 1.7 billion years old, making it some of the oldest and hardest rock in the world.

Quartz is so abundant that almost every rock contains at least a small amount of it. Quartz weighing 90,000 lbs. has been mined in Brazil. Because it contains pure silicon, quartz is used to make many computer components. Quartz occurs in virtually every color. Common colors are clear, white, gray, purple, yellow, brown, black, pink, green, red.

Quartz has a scratch hardness of 7 and often forms hard, tough fragments that withstand all sorts of mechanical and chemical attacks. Crystals form clear hexagonal (6-sided) forms when space allows (Fig. 1). Quartz is a major component of many types of rock. Quartz is abundant in certain igneous rocks.

Quartz is extracted by open pit mining, which involves extracting minerals from a burrow. Most of the time mining operations involve using bulldozers and backhoes to remove the soil and clay around the quartz to expose to the surface. On rare occasions, miners have to use explosives when the quartz they need to expose is deep underground.

Quartzite is a compact, hard, nonfoliated, medium to coarsely crystalline, and almost mono mineral metamorphic rocks with granoblastic texture. The isometric grain shape and their jagged contacts are a consequence of the process of recrystallization and loss of primary forms and contacts of grain under high pressure and high-temperature conditions.

## Quartzite | Minerals Crushing in Mining - JXSX Mine - JXSC Rock Crusher
The intense heat and pressure of metamorphism cause the quartz grains to compact and become tightly intergrown with each other, resulting in very hard and dense rock. Relation to Mining, Because it is so dense and resistant to both physical and chemical weathering, it is a poor bedrock on which to form soil.
