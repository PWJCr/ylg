## Gold and climate change: An introduction | World Gold Council
Gold is rare and, as with other precious metals, a lot of ore is mined and processed to produce small amounts of pure metal. The gold production process therefore uses a relatively high level of energy to bring finished gold to market and has a higher greenhouse (GHG) emissions intensity per tonne of finished product than many other bulk metals. But the relatively small volumes of gold

gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

## production plant of carbon gold ore
Production Of Carbon Gold Ore. Production Of Carbon Gold Ore. Manganese Processing. Highcarbon ferromanganese. The primary product of the smelting process outlined above is a carbonsaturated ferroalloy containing 76 to 80 percent manganese, 12 to 15 percent iron, up to 7.5 percent carbon, and up to 1.2 percent silicon.

## production of carbon gold ore
This process removes up to 93 percent of the gold and 70 percent of the silver from the ore. Carbon granules are then added to the solution. The gold attaches to the carbon and is pulled from the solution. We then "strip" the gold from the carbon by washing it with a caustic cyanide solution. The carbon is later recycled.
