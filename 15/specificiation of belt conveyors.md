## Steel cord conveyor belts - Metso Outotec
A typical carcass with 7 x 7 hot-galvanised steel cords provides a tensile strength of up to 2,000 N/mm. Also available as 7 x 19 for higher tensile strength (10 000 N/mm). Standard cords have an elongation of 0.22 - 0.28%. High structural strength and pull-out strength ensure good resistance against fatigue.

## Belt Conveyor - Datasheet | Vention
As an example, a conveyor needs to move a load of 20 kg at 500mm/s up a 10 degree incline. The conveyor must occasionally be able to accelerate the mass at 0.5m/s^2. The width of the belt conveyor is 457mm. In this case our variables are 20kg for mass, 0.5m/s^2 for acceleration, 10 degrees for angle theta, and 120N for deformation force.

## How to Specify Conveyor Belts | Cisco-Eagle
It's always important to understand your load for conveying applications. You should know the dimensions, shape and weight of your loads. Your load should be the right size for your belt and fit comfortably on it. If it weighs too much for the conveyor's specifications, it may fail to convey, convey slowly or even damage your drive.

Jan 26, 2021Before proceeding to design a conveyor belt system, engineers must set a design specification. Common design specifications set during the early design stages include the volume flow rate of bulk material, conveyor capacity, transporting distance and the material lump size. These will serve as a guide for the design of the conveyor belt to be made.

## Conveyor Systems Specifications - Redline Systems
In the world of belt systems, drives reverse the direction of a conveyor. They can be found at various locations on a conveyor belt. Head and end drives are the most common drives, located at whichever side of the belt is responsible for product discharge. Different Types of Conveyor Belts. The conveyor belt considerations vary per system type.

Recommendation: Include belt cleaning performance specifications in the conveyor requirements. Allow adequate space for scavenger conveyors if the head chute design is such that at least 3 cleaners cannot fit in the available space and the carryback can be captured in a dribble chute with near-vertical walls. 9.
