The mines produced a fortune in the next few years but were closed again in 1891. Opened again in 1906, ore production lasted until 1940.  Butte district was actually a copper mine, but it also produced 2.9 million ounces (or more than 90 tons) of gold in the 1990's, most as byproduct of copper production. . Discussion.

## Where copper can be found?145
How is copper mined? Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.

Native Copper was the only source of copper until the turn of the century, when extraction methods were improved. The copper ores are far more abundant than Native Copper, and are the main source of copper today. Even though, Native Copper is sometimes mined on its own for the copper content. Copper ranks second as the most-used metal in the world.

Mining. Although large copper deposits are mined by open-cut methods in many of the major producing countries, most of the copper ore produced in Australia comes from underground mines. The traditional method used at most mines involves the ore being broken and brought to the surface for crushing.

Copper was discovered in China around 2800BC. Central America about 600 AD, and W. Africa nations about ninth or tenth century. Investment casting was discovered between 4500 - 4000 BC in S.E Asia, and carbon dating has provided evidence of copper mines at Alderley Edge, Cheshire and UK around 2280 - 1890 BC.

Availability & Mining. Copper was easily found in its metallic state in many areas of the ancient world, albeit in relatively small quantities. The shiny red, orange or brown metal was first used in the Balkans, Middle East, and Near East from 8000 to 3000 BCE. Egypt and Europe later followed suit and began to make their own copper artefacts.

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

The process of mining copper begins with drilling and blasting. Large drilling rigs bore a carefully designed pattern of holes approximately 12 inches in diameter and 60 feet deep into the rock. The holes are filled with an explosive compound of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate which blasts thousands of tons of ore in a single detonation.
