Zinc (Zn) is an essential component of thousands of proteins in plants, although it is toxic in excess. In this review, the dominant fluxes of Zn in the soil-root-shoot continuum are described, including Zn inputs to soils, the plant availability of soluble Zn 2+ at the root surface, and plant uptake and accumulation of Zn. Knowledge of these fluxes can inform agronomic and genetic

## zinc ore concentration plant
Zinc Ore Concentration Plant. Zinc ores contain 5-15 zinc.To concentrate the ore, it is first crushed and then ground to enable optimal separation from the other minerals.Typically, a zinc concentrate contains about 55 of zinc with some copper, lead and iron.Zinc concentration is usually done at the mine site to keep transport costs to smelters
