January 01, 1962 Limestones and dolomites form the economically important and exceedingly complex family of carbonate rocks. They are set distinctly apart from related rock families by their intrabasinal and highly local origin, their genetic dependence upon organic activity, and their extreme susceptibility to post- depositional modification.
