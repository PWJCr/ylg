## What is Limestone? - WorldAtlas
Limestone is a sedimentary rock, although it has a hardness of 3-4 Mohs and a density of 2.5 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The rock is primarily composed of calcite or calcium carbonate, with most of these rocks being around 95% calcium carbonate. Being so high in calcium makes limestone rock polish and smooth better.

Blue Chrysocolla. Beside green, chrysocolla occurs as blue stones. This blue gemstone is very bright in color, and ranges in clarity from translucent to opaque. However, the blue stone is quite soft, with hardness pegged at 2.5 to 3.5 in the Mohs scale, making chrysocolla rather unsuitable for jewelry.

As the Earth's crust began to expand and erode heat and pressure pushed the solid minerals up to the Earth's surface which formed colossal rock beds.
