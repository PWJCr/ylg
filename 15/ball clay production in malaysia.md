## About Ball Clay
Ball clay is a highly plastic variety of kaolin having high binding power, tensile strength and shrinkage. Ball clays or plastic clays are fine grained, highly plastic sedimentary clays, which fire to a light or near white colour. They are used mainly in the manufacture of ceramic white ware and are valued for their key properties of plasticity
