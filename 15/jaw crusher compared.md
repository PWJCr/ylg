## Compare Gyratory Cone Crusher with Jaw Crusher
Primary jaw crusher is required to be evenly feed and needs the help of ore bin and feeder. When the ore fragment is larger than 400mm, jaw crusher should be equipped with heavy kind feeding machine. 3. Gyratory crusher has the advantages of deep crushing chamber, continuous work, high production ability and low power consumption.

Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
