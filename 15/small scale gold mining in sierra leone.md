## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

In 1989 when the Government of Sierra Leone regularized small-scale gold mining operations in the country, it was estimated that about 60,000 to 80,000 ounces of gold hitherto produced by Small Scale miners were smuggled out of the country annually.

Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) has largely been dismissed as an economically insignificant, subsis- tence based activity in Sierra Leone. This is in sharp contrast to the artisanal diamond sector, which has historically been seen as a much more significant livelihood option.

Unlike most countries on the continent, however, Sierra Leone has a long history of mining at the small-scale and artisanal level. Minerals, particularly diamonds, are in fact widely believed to have been one if not the main factor at the root of Sierra Leone's decade-long civil war in the 1990s.

The Pampana River is one of many rivers in Sierra Leone that have become heavily polluted due to gold mining in its headwaters (Akiwumi 2014; Kamara 2015; Chimange 2018). Active and abandoned gold mining operations vary from commercial mining operations up to several square kilometers in size to local small-scale artisanal mining operations.

Sierra Leone's burgeoning artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sector provides critical livelihoods for women and young men in a place where viable income-generating options are few. But the country's ASGM sector is also largely informal and associated with a range of serious social and environmental challenges, including mercury use.

This paper argues that a formalised small-scale gold mining sector could ameliorate Sierra Leone's emerging 'crisis of youth'. Burgeoning pockets of unemployed young men now found scattered throughout the country, the mobilisation of whom proved instrumental in prolonging civil war in the 1990s, have fuelled fresh concerns about renewed violence.
