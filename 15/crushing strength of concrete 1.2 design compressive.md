## Compressive strength of rocks - PetroWiki
Estimating compressive strength. General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis, so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0. C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities, but many

## Concrete Core Compressive Strength | The Structural World
Table 1.1 Example Core Tests Results. Notice that a series of coring samples are obtained as per table 1.1. According to ACI 318, as stated in ACI 214-4R-03 Chapter 7, the suspected concrete is considered adequate if the average corrected strength of the three cores exceeds 0.85fc' and no individual strength is lesser than 0.75fc'. Therefore to calculate the compressive strength fc' for
