Classification of Sand: According to the size of grains, the sand is classified as fine, coarse and gravelly. ADVERTISEMENTS: The sand passing through a screen with clear openings of 1.5875 mm is known as the fine sand. It is mainly used for plastering. The sand passing through a screen with clear openings of 3.175 mm is known as the coarse sand.

## River Processes - Geography AS
In the case of a river, the agent is water. The water can erode the river's channel and the river's load.  Cavitation is an interesting method of erosion. Air bubbles trapped in the water get compressed into small spaces like cracks in the river's banks.  As an example, a river flowing at 10cms-1 will transport clay, silt and sand

Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
