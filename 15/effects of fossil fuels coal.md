## Fossil Fuels - Types, Uses, Advantages & Disadvantages - BYJUS
Disadvantages. Fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide when burnt which is a major greenhouse gas and the primary source of pollution. This has contributed to global warming. They are a non-renewable resource, i.e., once used they cannot be replaced. Combustion of fossil fuels makes the environment more acidic.

Fossil fuel is essentially fossilized organic compounds, that have been subjected to extremes of temperature and pressure, which results in these dead organisms (both flora and fauna) being transformed into oil, gas and coal. As a result of earth's geological activity, this transformation takes place and this essentially becomes the fossil fuel.

The amount of carbon stored in fossil fuels is considerably larger--on the order of 5000 Gt--and the vast majority is in the form of coal. The oceans contain even more carbon--some 38,000 Gt--but the greatest part of these vast stores are held effectively out of circulation in the form of dissolved bicarbonate in the intermediate and deep ocean.

Overview. Fossil fuels—including coal, oil, and natural gas—have been powering economies for over 150 years, and currently supply about 80 percent of the world's energy. Fossil fuels formed millions of years ago from the carbon-rich remains of animals and plants, as they decomposed and were compressed and heated underground.

The burning of fossil fuels releases several harmful pollutants into the air. These include carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2), mercury, lead, and particulate matter. Most air pollution is caused by the burning of non-renewable sources of energy such as coal, gas, and petroleum.

## Fossil fuel
The burning of fossil fuels has a number of negative externalities - harmful environmental impacts where the effects extend beyond the people using the fuel. The actual effects depend on the fuel in question. All fossil fuels release CO 2 when they burn, thus accelerating climate change.Burning coal, and to a lesser extent oil and its derivatives, contribute to atmospheric particulate matter
