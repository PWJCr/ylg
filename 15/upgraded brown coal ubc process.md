## Change of combustion characteristics of Indonesian low rank coal due to 
UBC process can produce upgraded coals with better combustion characteristics compared to those of raw coals. 1. The ignition temperature (Tig) of all the upgraded coals increased. The slight increase in Tig indicates that the decrease in the volatile matter due to the UBC process was not obviously changed. 2.

## Mine mouth power generation system based on upgraded brown coal (UBC 
Kobe Steel has developed a process for upgrading brown coal by applying a unique slurry dewatering technology. A study has been conducted using the upgraded brown coal (UBC? ) made from Indian lignite to verify its applicability in improving the efficiency of mine-mouth power generation. As a result, it has been confirmed that UBC-based power

## Kobe Steel to Start Indonesian Trial Project to Upgrade Brown Coal into 
The UBC Process raises the heat value of brown coal 1.5 times, to the same level as high-rank bituminous coal and has only one-third the ash. At the same time, it solves the problem of shipping and storage limitations, making possible the utilization of upgraded coal as a substitute for high-rank coal.
