## How Aluminum Works | HowStuffWorks
­After th­e ore is discovered, open-pit mines typically provide the bauxite that will eventually become aluminum. First bulldozers clear land above a depos­it. Then workers loosen the soil with explosives, which bring the ore to the surface.  The steps in aluminum smelting are described below: Alumina is dissolved in molten cryolite at

## Aluminium Mining And Processing | Mining Informations
Aluminium is mined from bauxite-contained mining areas since the production of aluminium is entirely reliable on extraction from bauxite. It is not found in free form and is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust. Bauxite is the only ore containing 20-25 percent of aluminium from where the metal is extracted and commercially

Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.
