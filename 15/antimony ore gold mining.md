Antimony, is a key ingredient to powering our lives and the Stibnite Gold Project site is the largest known deposit of antimony in the United States. Americans use 44,000,000 pounds of antimony each year. As a metal strengthener, antimony is used in batteries, from cell phones to hybrid vehicles, and cable sheathing. Antimony is also a fire

The rate of oxidation of stibnite is strongly dependent on pH with appreciable dissolution at pH 12, reducing to low levels at pH 10. Figure 52.1 shows Hedley and Tabachnick's (1958) results of the cyanidation of a synthetic ore containing 0.25% stibnite at pH values of 10, 11, and 12. At higher pH values, higher levels of antimony pentoxide have been observed on gold surfaces, which then

Antimony (Sb) was utilised over several millennia as the prime material to opacify or decolour glass and glazes, as well as an accompanying element in copper (Cu) alloys. Metallic antimony objects are rare, and mostly confined to Chalcolithic Central Italy and to the first millennia BCE in the southern Caucasus.

Stibnite is also a minor constituent of gold-bearing sulphide reefs of the Bendigo Zone and there is bournonite (PbCuSbS 3) in the silver-lead ores of eastern Victoria.

As of 31 December 2019, 100% of Australia's Ore Reserves of antimony are attributable to the Costerfield mine in Victoria (Table 2). Costerfield produces antimony as a by-product to gold and is Australia's only antimony producer. Ore Reserves were down 73% from 2018 levels owing to reclassification of the Hillgrove deposit in New South Wales.

Much of the ore is stibnite, with quartz as a minor impurity, and assays show the tenor to vary from 40 to 65 percent antimony. Sulphantimonites are less abundant but likewise occur as disseminated crystals and as kidney-shaped bodies.
