Concrete strength also comes into play, but most slab concrete is around 3000 to 4000 psi, so it's not a major factor. The tensile strength of concrete is typically taken as 10 to 15% of the compressive strength, so only about 400 or 500 psi. Compare that to the tensile strength of Grade 60 rebar, which is 60,000 psi.

General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis, so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0. C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities, but many

## LABORATORY TESTS TO DETERMINE STRENGTH OF ROCKS - The Constructor
The specimen is placed in compression testing machine and subjected to compression with a stress rate of 0.5 to 1.0MPa per second. Note down the peak load value (P) where it fails and find out the strength of rock using below formula. Where A = initial c/s area of specimen. q u = P/A
