## Primary & Secondary AG Autogenous Grinding
Liner wear in primary mills is reported to be greater than the wear on crushing surfaces and mill liners in a crushing and grinding circuit. Overall savings in steel consumed are estimated to be 55% to 60% of the cost of rod and sometimes ball wear. Savings in semi-autogenous milling should be less due to ball wear and increased liner wear.

A different philosophy applies to the crushing and grinding of Gypsum. Gypsum as a mineral (CaSO4·2H2O) is number 2 on the Mohs scale of hardness; only Talc is softer. This would lead one to believe that it should be easy, to crush, like coal for example, and our equipment was formerly designed on this basis.

## Rock Crusher - Eastman Rock Crusher
Eastmancrushing understands crushing and grinding machines well. We are one of the leaders in rock crushing in China for about 40 years.  In most aggregate crushing plants, primary crushing is carried out in a jaw crusher, although a gyratory primary crusher may be used. If material is easily crushed and not excessively abrasive, an impact

## Mineral processing
Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on "run-of-mine" [3] ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution, the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition.

##  The Efficiency of Blasting Verses Crushing and Grinding
THE EFFICIENCY OF BLASTING VERSES CRUSHING AND GRINDING by Jack Eloranta 1997  Run of mine rock size is measured as it enters the primary crusher through the use of a video camera and a pc-based, digital image analyzer.(Grannes,1994) A size of 80% passing .5 m(19 in.) is used. Crushing is done in three stages, reducing to 80%
