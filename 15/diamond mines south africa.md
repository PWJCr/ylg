## Economic Impacts - Diamond mining in South africa
There is a large economic impact of diamond mining in South Africa as diamonds provide a lot of money to the economy, which provides better living conditions. Diamonds today are mined in about 25 different countries but around 49% of diamonds come from South Africa. South Africa is the fourth largest diamond producer in the world.
