## Coal Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Describing and eliminating the health hazards of coal processing requires an understanding of the nature of the raw materials, products, by-products, the type of pollutants produced, the design of the plant and its operating methods (Wadden, 1976 ). The structure of coal was described in Chapter 6 and is thought to be a highly linked amorphous

Some of its types are used for cooking. 4. Anthracite. This is a type of resin black coal. It has the highest content of hydrocarbon and is hard to ignite, but burns for a long time without soot; it also releases a large amount of heat (more than 9 kW/kg). Anthracite is most often used for heating.

Coal is baked in furnaces to produce coal coke in this process. Manufacturers utilise coal coke to smelt iron ore into iron and make steel after this is generated.

Coke in 10- to 25-millimetre sizes is much used in the manufacture of phosphorus and calcium carbide; from the latter, acetylene, mainly for chemical purposes, is made. Large quantities of the smallest sizes (less than 12 millimetres), known as coke breeze, are suited for sintering small iron ore prior to use in blast furnaces.
