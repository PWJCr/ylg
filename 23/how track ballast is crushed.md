Abstract. Railway track formations generally consist essentially of a layer of coarse aggregate, or ballast, in which the sleepers are embedded (see Fig. 12.1). The ballast may rest directly on the subgrade or, depending on the bearing capacity, on a layer of blanketing sand. The layer of ballast is intended to provide a free draining base

## Looking for ideas about ballasting and secure the track or not
For ballast, I intend to use crushed granite. The road-bed will be contained, with slightly raised sides (I will live with this scenic compromise). I do not intend to glue the ballast.  If you free float your track in ballast as the prototype railroads do, then assemble without gaps. This is one of the reasons I prefer free floating track.
