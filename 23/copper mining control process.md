## Copper Mining, Water and the United Nations' SDGs
A fast-growing population of 780 million people around the world lacks access to clean water. Water scarcity proves one of the greatest challenges of the United Nations-led Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is thus a priority for the Copper Alliance® and its members. Mining is water intensive, particularly during the separation and

## Evaluation of copper resistant bacteria from vineyard soils and mining 
Vineyard soils are frequently polluted with high concentrations of copper due application of copper sulfate in order to control fungal diseases. Bioremediation is an efficient process for the treatment of contaminated sites. Efficient copper sorption bacteria can be used for bioremoval of copper from contaminated sites.

## Copper Processing | Multotec
The physical removal process of copper is dependent on the type of ore (either oxide or sulphide ores). These kinds of ores have different extraction processes, as explained in detail below.  Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes).

The final step consists of fire refining the blister copper to reduce the sulfur and oxygen to even lower levels. This oxidation-reduction process is usually carried out in a separate furnace to ensure that the final smelter product reaches the level of 99.5 percent copper that is required for electrolytic refining.

The process of mining copper begins with drilling and blasting. Large drilling rigs bore a carefully designed pattern of holes approximately 12 inches in diameter and 60 feet deep into the rock. The holes are filled with an explosive compound of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate which blasts thousands of tons of ore in a single detonation.

## The effects of copper mining on local people and ecology
They replied that copper mining requires the use of large amounts of suphuric acid to extract the copper from the ores. Especially in high rainfall areas, this creates the phenomenon of acid mists and acid rains, that can fall many miles from the mine and smelters, causing damage to buildings, crops and most important, human health.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).
