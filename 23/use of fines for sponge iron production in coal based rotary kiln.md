Wednesday, August 3, 2011. During the process of manufacture of sponge iron, coal injection plays a very vital role in maintaining the product quality. Due to highly endothermic nature of Boudouard reaction, heat has to be continuously supplied in entire reduction zone of rotary kiln. Generally the length of reduction zone is 60-70% of total

DRI, also known as sponge iron, is the product of reducing iron oxide in the form of iron ore and steel plant wastes into metallic iron, below the melting point of iron and typically in the range of C. Iron oxide is charged into shaft furnace, rotary kiln, or fluidized beds in the form of pellet, iron ore lumps, or fines.

The Midrex® and Energiron gas-based processes use predominantly iron ore pellets as feedstock, but sometimes with inclusion of lump ore in the furnace charge. The Circored and Finmet / Finored gas-based processes utilize iron ore fines as feedstock.The SLRN coal-based rotary kiln process uses lump ore and, increasingly, pellets as feedstock.

In general -1mm fraction in sponge fines of 0-4mm shall be restricted to less than 30% and +12mm in sponge lumps of 4-18mm shall be restricted to 20-30%. for effective use in induction furnaces . Material Balance and Energy Balance: The typical material balance and energy balance for 100tpd kiln is as given below. RECOMMENDATIONS :

## New Sponge Iron Rotary Kiln Design In Sponge Iron Manufacturing Process
Sep 10, 2020The coarse coal in this part of coal passes through the coarse coal branch into the 30%-60% of the sponge iron rotary kiln body for combustion and heating, and the fine coal passes through the fine coal branch for combustion and heating at the kiln head.

##  Sponge Iron Production From Ore -coal Composite Pellets in Tunnel Kiln
Usually, Iron ore fines and coal fines are introduced into the saggers in the form of separate concentric cylinders for reduction. The iron ore fines forms a hollow cylinder at the middle of the sagger and its outer surface and core is filled with coal fines as shown in Fig 4. The loaded saggers on the trolley enter the tunnel kiln for processing.

## Brief Process Of Coal Based Sponge Iron Rotary Kiln
The carbon content in sponge iron produced by coal based rotay kiln processes are generally low and is in the range og 0.08 to 0.20 .The carbon content in gas based processes can be controllrd to a level of 1.5 to 2.0 based on requirement for steel making.Nov 12, 2020 01.03.2017 2D CFD model of rotary kiln of sponge iron process is developed to
