## Centerless Grinding Process | Total Grinding Solutions (TGS)
Centerless grinding is the process of removing material from the outside diameter of a work piece using an abrasive wheel. In its simplest form, a centerless grinder consists of the machine base, grinding wheel, regulating wheel and work blade. With centerless grinding, the work piece is not mechanically held to drive the part.
