The first process, natural decomposition, usually takes millions of years. The other processes take considerably less time. The processing plant is located in the immediate vicinity of the natural deposit of material to minimize the costs of transportation. If the plant is located next to a sand dune or beach, the plant may process only sand.

## Silica Sand Processing | Silica Sand Washing Plant - LZZG
Silica Sand. Silica sand, also known as silica or quartz sand, is a kind of hard, wear-resistant and chemical stable silicate mineral. Its main mineral composition is SiO2. According to different mining and processing methods, silica sand can be divided into artificial silica sand, water washed sand, scrubbed sand, selected (flotation) sand, etc.

The production of sand fillers is simple because it includes, at most, only washing and classification into grades differing in grain size. Because sand has a negligible degree of porosity, it has an extremely low specific surface area in the range from 40 to 160 cm 2 /g. The material usually contains more than 99.7% SiO 2, with absorbed water being at a negligible level (0.1%).

Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, is mainly composed of silica( SiO2), which is the main raw material for making glass.Silica sand has ordinary silica sand, refined silica sand and high purity silica sand. The content of silica in ordinary silica sand is between 90% and 99%, the content of iron oxide is less than 0.02%, the content of silica in refined silica sand is between 99% and 99.5

## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep
