With the increase in the screen length, the screening percentages of 3-0 mm and 6-3 mm material gradually increases, as shown in Fig. 13. When the screen length increased to 2534.4 mm, the screening percentages of 3-0 mm material under three conditions were 97.77%, 97.58% and 97.46%, respectively, and those of 6-3 mm material were 40.61

Screen Motion. The processes of particle stratification and probability are caused by the vibration of the screen. On inclined screens, the vibration is caused by a circular motion in a vertical plane of 1/8 to 1/2- inch amplitude at 700 to 1000 cycles/min. The vibration lifts the particles up, thereby, causing stratification.

Here, the opening rate of screen surface of vibrating screen can be understood as the effective screening area. That is, the ratio of the screen area to the total area of the screen surface. The larger the effective screen area is, the higher the productivity per unit screen surface is, and the higher the screening efficiency is.

## 「screen screening vibration」
17/06/2020· Screening equipment consists of a drive that induces vibration, a screen media that causes particle separation, and a deck that holds the screen media and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration. It is used during the mechanical screening processes, designed to separate one material from another.

## Basic concepts of vibrating screens: What they are, what they  - Rollier
Also called simply screens, a vibrating screen is formed by a vibrant chassis that supports in its interior one or several surfaces or elements of screening. The screens serve to classify the different particles by size, starting from a bulk product in a continuous process. The inlet material (the raw product) advances from the part where the
