As an example, consider the case when the point is a 9 that is shown in the tree diagram to the right. Once you roll a 9, there is a 4/36=1/9 chance of rolling it again on any roll and a 6/36=1/6 chance of rolling a 7 and losing. However, there is a 13/18 chance that you will roll neither and the game will continue for another round.

A dice is a tool providing a random integer each time you roll it. Something like that: function rollDice() { return / some randomly generated number / } Every programming language has a built-in random function. In JavaScript, it's Math.random: function rollDice() { return Math.random(); } That's a good start: returning a random number.

The distance between the mill rolls can be varied and this gap is known as nip. The speed difference between the rolls is called friction ratio and it allows the shearing action. The back roll moves faster than the front roll; a common friction ratio is 1:1.25. Two roll mill mixing is also known as open mill mixing.

There are five dice, so whatever the first die rolls there is a 1/6 chance that the second die is the same number. If that occurs, there's a 1/6 chance that the third die is the same, ditto the fourth and the fifth. So probability of Yahztee in one roll is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/1296.

Fig 4 Roll configurations in rolling mills. Two-high mill roll configuration - This is the most commonly used rolling mill configuration. In this configuration, there are two horizontally mounted rolls. The rolling mill motor drives either both rolls (top and bottom) or only one roll (normally the bottom roll) with the top roll rotating due to the friction between the roll and the work piece.

4.2.3.1.1 Roll Mills. The roll mill is the simplest batch mixing equipment. The principal design consists of two horizontal rolls, usually of equal size, arranged side by side and rotating toward each other at different speeds. The ratio of the peripheral speeds of the rolls, known as friction ratio, ranges from 1 to 2 but is usually around 1.2.

In the board game Monopoly, we move our token based on the sum of the dice rolls, and if we've rolled doubles, we can roll again. Looking at the example outcomes above, it's obvious that the outcomes cannot be equally likely if we care about the sum of the dice rolls. The outcomes (1, 5), (2, 4) and (4, 2) all have sum 6.

## Javanotes 6.0, Excercises for Chapter 3 - University of Chicago
How many times do you have to roll a pair of dice before they come up snake eyes? You could do the experiment by rolling the dice by hand. Write a computer program that simulates the experiment. The program should report the number of rolls that it makes before the dice come up snake eyes. (Note: "Snake eyes" means that both dice show a value

## Roll mill rolls Basics & How to Choose the Right Roll
There are two types of rolls: hot rolls and cold rolls. The materials of the work rolls in common cold rolls are 9cr, 9cr2, 9crv, 8crmov, etc. The cold rolls require surface quenching and the hardness is hs45~105. The commonly used materials for hot rolls are 55mn2, 55cr, 60crmnmo, 60simnmo, etc. Hot rolls are used in the processing of billets

## Roll Mill 15 1 Double Pairs Of Rolls Sequence
Roll diameter is in the order of 25 cm. Roll length depends on the capacity. Two or three pairs of rolls are provided, mounted one on top of the other. A vibrating conveyor secures feeding of the mill at a uniform rate. The corrugations on the upper pair of rolls are coarser and deeper than those on the lower pairs.
