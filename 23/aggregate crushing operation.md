The aggregate morphology is mainly governed by aggregate mineralogy, type of rock and crushing operation [ 8, 9, 10 ]. For given aggregate type, the associated crushing mechanism plays a decisive role in governing morphology of aggregates. The crushing of aggregates involves three prime mechanisms, namely abrasion, cleavage and impact [ 11 ].

## sand and aggregates, crushing, maximum yield - The Weir Group
23 May 2017. The two most important factors when producing sand and aggregate is shape (referred to as cubical crushed particles) and maximum yield of highest value product. Every successful aggregate producer can achieve both with the right raw materials, the right equipment, the right flow sheet and the right operation of equipment.

Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.
