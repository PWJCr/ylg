## What Is The Difference Between A Closed And Open Circuit?
Such a circuit is called a closed circuit. What is open and closed circuit Brainly? Answer: Closed circuit is meant to be a circuit activated by a switch that "closes" a circuit loop and allows current to flow. Open circuit is a condition when an electrical terminal is not connected to any impedance (facing infinite value for impedance).

Closed, Open, and Short Circuits dummies. You need a closed path, or closed circuit, to get electric current to flow. If there's a break anywhere in the path, you have an open circuit, and the current stops flowing — and the metal atoms in the wire quickly settle down to a peaceful, electrically neutral existence.

## describe an open circuit crushing
Open crushing circuit is often used to achieve an initial degree of size reduction ahead of a closed circuit, which then completes the size reduction and controls product size. Closed circuits are used where the single stage crushing process is relatively inefficient and several cycles of breakage are required [1].
