## 3 Types of Crushers - Optimum Crush
Nov 12, 2021There are two kinds of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. The single toggle jaw crusher uses a Shaft rotation for a compressive action. The double toggle crusher has two shafts toggle plates each. Gyratory crushers. Gyratory crushers are mostly restricted for primary crushing purposes, but they see some usage for secondary crushing

The Cone crusher is the most new and most economical of all the crushers The principle of operation of gyratory & cone crusher is almost same But there are two exceptions. Firstly in Gyratory crusher the outside crushing surface flares in from top to bottom but in Cone crusher it is vice versa. Hence area of discharge gets increased

## Gyratory Crusher-MECRU
The gyratory crusher has a huge output and is often used for coarse crushing operations of large enterprises or large production lines. It can crush the raw material ore produced by drilling and blasting to a suitable particle size for subsequent crushing process or beneficiation process. It is the key to the entire process.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

The two most common primary crushers used for coarse run-of-mine material are the jaw and gyratory crushers. These primary crushers break rock through compressive forces created by a hard moving surface forcing and squeezing the rocks towards a hard stationary surface. A Jaw Crusher reduces large rocks by dropping them into a flat "V

Two jaws of manganese steel are provided in this laboratory Jaw Crusher. The movable jaw produces two blows for every revolution, thus reducing over sizing to a mini. A combination of forward and downward strokes with a rocking action exerts pressure on the coarser material, yet permits the finished material to pass through the jaws.
