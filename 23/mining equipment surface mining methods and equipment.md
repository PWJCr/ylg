## The Benefits of Using Precision Surface Mining Methods
Precision surface mining methods â safe and sustainable Flying rock debris, dust, noise and vibrations â these are a few of the common safety concerns for surface mining operations. For more than a century, drilling holes into hard rock and using explosives is the first step of processing the mineral-rich material and aggregates.

## Analysis of strip mining methods and equipment selection
Mining is required to supply shale to the retorts of aboveground processes. The majority of oil shale mining is expected to be by the underground room-and-pillar method. Surface mining (i.e., open pit mining) may also be used to supply material for surface retorts and may be appropriate for up to 15 to 20% of the oil shale resources.
