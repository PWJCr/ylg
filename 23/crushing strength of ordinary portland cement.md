## Chemical Composition of Portland Cement - Builders Booklet
The most common compounds responsible for strength are tricalcium silicate and dicalcium silicate. They together account for between 70% and 80% of cement. The average C 3 S content of modern cement is around 45%, while C 2 S content is around 25%. The total amount of C 3 A and C 4 AF in current cements has decreased significantly.

Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is by far the most important type of cement. Prior to 1987, there was only one grade of OPC which was governed by IS .  43 grade and 53 grade depending upon the strength of the cement at 28 days when tested as per IS 4031- 1988.

## Composition of cement - Penn State College of Engineering
Portland cement gets its strength from chemical reactions between the cement and water. The process is known as hydration. This is a complex process that is best understood by first understanding the chemical composition of cement. Manufacture of cement Portland cement is manufactured by crushing, milling and proportioning the following materials:

But PPC employs natural and industrial waste which reduces the environment pollution. In OPC cement there are 3 grades available and the strength of PPC matches OPC 33 after the process of curing. PPC has low initial setting strength than OPC but it hardens over time with proper curing. PPC is cheaper than OPC.

## Ordinary Portland Cement: Uses, Advantages & Disadvantages
Introduction to ordinary Portland cement: Ordinary Portland cement is one of the most widely used cement. The name Portland cement was given by Joseph Aspdin in 1824 due to its similarity in colour and high quality when it hardened like a Portland stone. Portland stone is white grey limestone within the island of Portland, Dorset.

## Ordinary Portland cement vs. Sulphate Resistant Cement - Zarea
In the case of 53-grade cement 53 MPa of strength is gained over the same period of time. The 53-grade cement is used in construction projects which are fast and where initial strength needs to be abrupt. Unlike 43 grade cement, the 53-grade cement sets fast. The minimum strength of 27 MPa is attained by 53-grade cement in three days.

##  Re-Investigation of the Compressive Strength of Ordinary Portland 
Keywords: Compressive strength, Ordinary portland cement (OPC), Lime concrete (LC). 1. Introduction Conventional concrete is a mixture of cement, sand, aggregates and water [14]. The overall relevance of concrete in virtually all civil engineering practice and building construction works cannot be over-emphasized. According to [12], concrete is a

## Concrete Strength at 7 Days - CivilWeb Spreadsheets
The rate of strength gain of the concrete will depend on the cementitious materials used. Ordinary Portland cement will gain strength in a manner similar to the below graph with the concrete strength after 7 days around 60% of the 28 day strength. Rapidly setting cements are available which can gain significant compressive strength in a few hours.
