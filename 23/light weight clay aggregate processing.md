Expanded clay is a lightweight aggregate manufactured from naturally occurring clay. It is non-toxic, disease free, chemically inert and has a neutral pH. It is used for a variety of applications including; a construction aggregate in lightweight concrete castings, floors and panels and as a loose lightweight fill.

1. The Weight. One of the first problems that come with concrete roof tiles is their sheer weight. When compared to other roofing materials like asphalt, clay, composite, and metal, concrete roof tiles are significantly heavier. Concrete tiles can weight anywhere from 820 to 1,1100 pounds per 100 square feet, which is all weight that goes on. This self-adhering roofing underlayment is composed

Aug 01, 2006 Light-weight aggregates were successfully produced from blending marine clay and a CaF 2-rich semiconductor industry waste at loadings of 10, 30, and 50%. The mixtures all showed good bloating behavior during firing and the density of the product was well below that required for light-weight aggregates.
