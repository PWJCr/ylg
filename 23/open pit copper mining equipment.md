## Reading: Open-Pit Mining | Geology | | Course Hero
Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.  Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper is extracted at grades as low as 0.15% to 0.2%, generally in massive open-pit mines in Chile, where the

## Open-pit Mining - Mining North Works
To safely open-pit mine the kimberlite, water retention structures (dikes) were constructed in the lake to hold back the lake waters during mining. The main cost advantage of open-pit mining is that it allows mining with more efficient larger equipment. This means faster production and mining of lower grades of ore is possible.

Mar 25, 2021Occasionally, removing a hilltop with explosives to expose the rocky materials beneath is the first step in creating an open pit. Rotary drills create the holes used for inserting the explosives for this process. The third type of surface mining is strip mining, which primarily extracts thin layers of coal from near the surface.

1.What is open pit miningï¼ Open pit mining is the process of removing the covering from the ore body to obtain the desired minerals. Open-pit mining can be divided into open-pit metal deposit mining, open-pit coal mining, and open-pit iron mining.The former mainly mines non-ferrous metals, the middle mainly mines coal and some non-metallic ores, and the latter mainly mines iron ore.

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.
