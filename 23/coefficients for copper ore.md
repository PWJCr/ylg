## Copper Ore - Official Satisfactory Wiki
Copper Ore is a common resource found in the world. It is smelted into Copper Ingots for further processing. Copper Ore can be harvested by hand (default E) in trace amounts from resource deposits scattered across the world, or from inexhaustible resource nodes on which Miners can be constructed to extract automatically. Additonally, Lizard Doggos will ocassionally bring it when tamed. Items

A 12-mile wooden pipeline delivered 100,000 gallons of water from the Colorado River per day. Originally incorporated in 1894 as Hedges, the town was abandoned in 1905. The United Mines Company renamed the town Tumco in 1910, as they unsuccessfully attempted to profitably mine the area.

## Properties: An Introduction to Copper
Copper is tough and ductile, but is valuable due its ability to conduct electricity. While it is suited to many applications most centre around its excellent electrical conductivity (e.g. busbars and electric wire). Other uses utilise its corrosion resistance (e.g. water pipes and heat exchangers).

The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable. The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method. Concentration of Ore: The ore is crushed into a fine powder and a suspension is created in water. To this are added, Collectors and Froth Stabilizers.

## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In most cases, the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3-8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6-40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15-90 days duration for copper oxides and 10-18 months for sulfides. Of note, 80%-85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.

The coefficient of restitution is found by the formula. Coefficient of Restitution = speed up/speed down. In order to find speed we had to use the average height, that we measured, and put it in the formula. v = √ (2gh) Where v = velocity, g = 9.8m/s 2, and h = average height measured.

The coefficient of restitution (COR, also denoted by e), is the ratio of the final to initial relative speed between two objects after they collide.It normally ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 would be a perfectly elastic collision.A perfectly inelastic collision has a coefficient of 0, but a 0 value does not have to be perfectly inelastic.
