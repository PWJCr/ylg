## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical

Milling is a widely used industrial operation common for cases where size reduction of particles is required. It involves the size reduction of particles smaller than 10 mm. There is a vast range of mill types available, such as ball mills, vibratory mills, rod, jet, and cage mills. For a larger diameter, planetary ball mills can be used.

A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

Planetary ball mills are well known and used for particle size reduction on laboratory and pilot scales for decades while during the last few years the application of planetary ball mills has extended to mechanochemical approaches. Processes inside planetary ball mills are complex and strongly depend on the processed material and synthesis and, thus, the optimum milling conditions have to be

## Ball Mills Size Reduction
Size Reduction With Planetary Ball Mills. RETSCH Planetary Ball Mills are used for the pulverization of soft, fibrous, hard and brittle ma-terials. They achieve a very high final fineness down to the submicron range. The feed size depends on the mill and can be as large as 10 mm. If the sample feed size is larger than this then the sample must
