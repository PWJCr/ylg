## Going for Gold: Kenya Promises A More Transparent and Organized Mining 
However, this does not translate to concrete economic gains and mining remains to be only 1% of Kenya's economic output. This is partly because of poor regulation, and this is why the industry is seeking clarity. The New Mining Act. On 27 May 2016, the new Kenya Mining Act came into effect, overhauling the country's existing legislation.

The caving mining method is mainly used to manage the ground pressure around mining by caving the surrounding rock, and then filling it into the goaf to manage the ground pressure. When using this method for deep mining of gold mines, there are mainly the following methods. First, there is the sub-column caving method.
