## The working principle of jaw crusher - Mining Mobile Crushers and 
Although the structure of the jaw crusher is different, its working principle is the same, that is, the material is crushed by the periodic reciprocating motion of the movable jaw. In the process of swinging the movable jaw to the fixed jaw around the suspension mandrel, the material between the two jaw plates will be crushed, split and bent.

## Construction And Working Principle Of Jaw Crusher
Dec 25 2014 The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber.
