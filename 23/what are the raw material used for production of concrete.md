##  Concrete Blocks - Skat
Concrete block construction has gained importance and has become a valid alternative to fired clay bricks. The essential ingredients of concrete are cement, aggregate (sand, gravel) and water. Concrete blocks are produced in a large variety of shapes and sizes. They can be produced manually or with the help of machines.

## RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
The main materials used in cement production are minerals containing calcium oxide, silex, alumina and iron oxide. These components are rarely found in one type of raw material; therefore, for the cement production the raw mix is selected for the following components: CARBONATE COMPONENT (rich in calx) is contained in the raw mix in a quantity

## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
G. Habert, in Eco-efficient Construction and Building Materials, 2014 10.1 Introduction. Cement production has undergone tremendous developments since its beginnings some 2,000 years ago. While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history (Malinowsky, 1991), the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19 th century, first with shaft kilns, which were later

## Portland cement
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin, and is usually made from limestone.It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker

## Raw Material Substitution - Cembureau
The main raw material used in cement production has traditionally been limestone. Limestone is abundantly available, but over 60% of the industry's CO 2 emissions are caused by transformation of limestone into lime, called "decarbonation". Accordingly, part of the route towards a low carbon concrete-built environment can involve limestone substitution.

Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.

## How concrete block is made - material, manufacture, used, components 
The concrete commonly used to make concrete blocks is a mixture of powdered portland cement, water, sand, and gravel. This produces a light gray block with a fine surface texture and a high compressive strength. A typical concrete block weighs 38-43 lb (17.2-19.5 kg).

Importance of Raw Material in Textile Manufacturing: Raw material represents about 50 to 70% of the production cost of a short-staple yarn. This fact is sufficient to indicate the significance of the raw material for the yarn producer.

Concrete manufacturers expect their raw material suppliers to supply a consistent, uniform product. At the cement production factory, the proportions of the various raw materials that go into cement must be checked to achieve a consistent kiln feed, and samples of the mix are frequently examined using X-ray fluorescence analysis.

Aggregates are the main component of concrete, making up over 70 per cent of concrete by volume and 80 per cent by weight. You could say that aggregates provide the frame, and cement acts as the glue between the aggregate particles.
