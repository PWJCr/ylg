## Autoclaved Aerated Concrete - Cement
Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is made with fine aggregates, cement, and an expansion agent that causes the fresh mixture to rise like bread dough. In fact, this type of concrete contains 80 percent air. In the factory where it is made, the material is molded and cut into precisely dimensioned units.

Production. Autoclaved aerated concrete is cured in an autoclave - a large pressure vessel. In aircrete production the autoclave is normally a steel tube some 3 metres in diameter and 45 metres long. Steam is fed into the autoclave at high pressure, typically reaching a pressure of 800 kPa and a temperature of 180 °C.

Cast off-site using the process described above, the blocks are laid on a poured concrete footing. A thin-bed mortar (similar to tile thin-set) is then used to bond them together, with joints staggered between courses. At the top of the wall, a special U-shaped block is laid, which becomes the form for a concrete and rebar bond beam around wall.

Autoclaved aerated concrete, or AAC, is concrete that has been manufactured to contain lots of closed air pockets. Lightweight and fairly energy efficient, it is produced by adding a ing agent to concrete in a mould, then wire-cutting blocks or panels from the resulting 'cake' and 'cooking' them with steam (autoclaving).
