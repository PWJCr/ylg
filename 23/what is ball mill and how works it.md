## News - What is a ball mill used for?
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind, blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

 How a Ball Mill Works. Ball mills work by using balls to grind materials. Materials such as iron ore, pain and ceramics are added to the ball mill. Next, the ball mill is activated so that it rotates — either on its vertical or horizontal axis. As the ball bill rotates, the balls bounce around while striking the enclosed material. More
