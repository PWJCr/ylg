Rare earths are a set of 17 chemical elements in the periodic table that, because of their unique geochemical properties, are typically widely dispersed in the Earth's crust and are not often found in concentrated and economically exploitable forms. This fact requires special recovery and refining techniques to produce useable elements.

The REEs were first commercialized during the 1880s, when rare-earth oxide mixtures were used to make incandescent mantles for gas lights. The REEs were extracted from monazite mined from coastal heavy-mineral placer deposits in Brazil and India. Similar mixtures found applications in steel making.

## Rare earth elements: mining and refining - M i N M E T
Aug 5, 2022Rare earth elements (REEs) are lustrous, silvery-white, soft heavy metals with a vast array of industrial applications. They're used in the electrical and electronic industries, the oil industry, aviation and the manufacture of glass and lasers, among other things.

Rare earths are used in the renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines, batteries, catalysts and electric cars. Current mining, processing and sustainability aspects have been described in this paper. Rare earth availability is undergoing a temporary decline due mainly to quotas being imposed by the Chinese government on export and action taken against illegal mining operations.

## Mining Rare Earth Elements, the Environment, Tech, and the  - ETEKLY
The process of mining REEs is ecologically devastating. Processing one ton of rare earth metals releases 2,000 tons of radioactive materials, carcinogens, toxic compounds, acids, and other pollutants into the environment. Since thorium and uranium often occur alongside REEs in nature, tailings from mines tend to be radioactive.
