## West Coast Mining
In the 1860s gold was discovered throughout the southern half of the region, with alluvial deposits found from the Grey River and south down to Gillespie's Beach in glacier country. Later discoveries led to mining further north in the Grey and Buller Districts. The 1860s also mark the beginnings of West Coast coal mining.

Placer mining. Placer mining is used to extract gold from sand or gravel by using pans and water. Gold, which has a higher density than sand and gravel, will sink faster, making it easier to collect.  Longwall mining is commonly used in coal mines and involves the use of a shearer set on a kilometer long track to grind coal from the mine

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Destruction and poison linger. Bad mining practices can ignite coal fires, which can burn for decades, release fly ash and smoke laden with greenhouse gasses and toxic chemicals. Furthermore mining releases coal mine methane, a greenhouse gas 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.
