## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Sand casting
Sand casting, also known as sand molded casting, is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material. The term "sand casting" can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries.Over 60% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process.

Crystalline silica has a higher melting point (1610 °C) than iron, copper or aluminium and other common metals. This enables castings to be made by pouring molten metal into moulds made from silica sand and a binder. The physical and chemical characteristics of the sand are important. In the past naturally clay bonded moulding sands were used.
