## impact vs jaw crushers - Crushing and Screening Plant
The biggest difference between jaw crusher and impact crusher is: jaw crusher is always used as the primary crusher while the impact crusher is always used as the secondary crusher.. Jaw crusher has the characteristic of high impact resistance. So it is suitable for the primary crushing. The impact resistance of impact crusher is small, but it is good at shaping the product.
