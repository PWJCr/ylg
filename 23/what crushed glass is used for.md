## Can crushed glass be used as sand?elongcpa
The use of crushed waste glass as aggregate in concrete is problematic because of the chemical reaction between the alkali in the cement and the silica in the glass. This alkali-silica reaction (ASR) creates a gel, which swells in the presence of moisture, causing cracks and unacceptable damage of the concrete.

## Glass Beads VS Crushed Glass and When To Use Them
Glass beads and crushed glass are both effective abrasives that produce the desired finish on parts. Glass beads are typically used in blasting cabinets or recyclable types of blasting operations. Crushed glass is best for removing heavy coatings, paint layers or rust to reveal a clean and bare surface.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

Crushed glass sand can be used to partially replace the natural sand to produce concrete with at least equivalent mechanical properties of a concrete mix using natural aggregate only. The optimum replacement percentage is 45 per cent.? Durable concrete is expected when glass sand is used to partially replace natural sand.
