## List of Common Magnetic Rocks & Minerals (with Explanation)
Igneous rocks are not so magnetic to be attracted by magnets. Basic igneous rocks (e.g., gabbro) have a relatively high magnetite content. They are rocks with high magnetic properties (it doesn't mean a magnet can stick to them). The proportion of magnetite in igneous rocks decreases with increasing acidity (increasing SiO 2 content).

Rock magnetism is the study of the magnetic properties of rocks, sediments and soils.The field arose out of the need in paleomagnetism to understand how rocks record the Earth's magnetic field.

There are six basic types of magnetization: (1) diamagnetism, (2) paramagnetism, (3) ferromagnetism, (4) antiferromagnetism, (5) ferrimagnetism, and (6) superparamagnetism. Diamagnetism arises from the orbiting electrons surrounding each atomic nucleus. When an external magnetic field is applied, the orbits are shifted in such a way that the atoms set up their own magnetic field in opposition

Igneous rocks (from the Greek word for "fire") form when hot, molten rock (magma) crystallizes and solidifies. Magma originates deep within the Earth, near active plate boundaries or hot spots. Magma that rises to the surface is called lava. Igneous rocks are classified into two groups depending upon where the molten rock solidifies: Extrusive

## Paramagnetic Igneous Rock Examples
Feb 01, 2019 Because igneous rocks contain a large number of strong paramagnetic substances, such as magnetite, hornblende, and biotite, the susceptibility is significantly higher than sedimentary rocks (Lang et al., 2011). In general, from acid, middle to mafic igneous rocks, the susceptibility of igneous rocks gradually increases.
