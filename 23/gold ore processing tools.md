## nickel processing - Extraction and refining | Britannica
The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a

## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
During the early days of human civilization gold ore was dug out from the ground, crushed using simple tools, then the ore washed in water and then the recovered gold smelted in earthen kilns. The same process used today (with a few improvement) that has come with this same available technology.
