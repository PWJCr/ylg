Stainless Steel: Stainless steel or SS is undoubtedly the most common type of metal used for precision CNC manufacturing. Favored for its corrosion resistance and strength, the metal is used everywhere from surgical equipment to electronics hardware and many more. of the other alternatives such as molybdenum and chromium cannot resist corrosion.

## COAL FLOTATION - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The standard practice on coal in England has been to use cell-to-cell "Sub-A" Flotation Machines of the double overflow type. Several hundred of the large No. 30 cells (100 cu. ft./cell) are in use. Super-charging is not generally used. Flotation is carried out at low solids, usually under 10% dilution.

Physical coal cleaning processes, the mechanical separation of coal from its contaminants using differences in density, are by far the major processes in use today. Chemical coal cleaning processes are currently being developed, but their performance and cost are undetermined at this time.

## Characteristics of Coal | Fossil Consulting Services, Inc.
There are four different types of coal: Anthracite - contains between 86% and 98% carbon by weight and it burns in boilers slowly. Bituminous - contains between 69% & 86% carbon by weight. Sub-bituminous - contains less carbon, more water and is a less efficient source of heat for boilers. Lignite - contains up to 70% water by weight.

These are: Plant material, wood. Peat. Brown coal (lignite) Black coal (sub-bituminous, bituminous and anthracite) .. Each successive stage has a lower water content and a higher energy content. This means that when the same quantity of each material is burned, a greater amount of heat is released for each successive stage.

Scientists estimate that approximately 20 feet of decompressed plant matter may have been needed to form one foot of bituminous coal. Bituminous coals or soft coals are the largest group of coals. It is the most widely used type of coal in the world. It has been named so due to the presence of a gluey and tar-like substance known as bitumen in it.

An important property of coal is its reflectivity (or reflectance )—i.e., its ability to reflect light. Reflectivity is measured by shining a beam of monochromatic light (with a wavelength of 546 nanometres) on a polished surface of the vitrinite macerals in a coal sample and measuring the percentage of the light reflected with a photometer.
