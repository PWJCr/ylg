Professor J. B. Schneewind's recent excellent volume Mill's Ethical Writings has drawn attention to the necessity of studying Mill's notes to chapter XXIII of his father's Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind for a clear understanding of his theory of the moral sentiments.

## John Stuart Mill Quotes about Opinion - Lib Quotes
John Stuart Mill. It is better to be a human dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides. John Stuart Mill.

## Sympathy and Self-Interest: The Crisis in Mill's Mental History
23 Mill's awareness of discrepancies between thought and action, theory and practice, forms a recurring motif in his work. For example, in the Autobiography, as part of his introduction of his father, he points out that their large family contradicted James Mill's belief in Malthusianism.Later Mill declared that his education fitted him more 'to know than to do'.

The anti-self, or shadow as Carl Gustav Jung used to call it, is a precise reflection of man's basically good and constructive nature. When mapped, it seems that for most or even for all the many fine talents of man, there is a corresponding evil intention and talent in the person's anti-self. As man is as evil as he is good, he can only
