## Mining industry of Nigeria
Mining is the extraction or removal of minerals and metals from the earth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining, processing, and sales of coal, lignite, and coke products until 1999.. Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu. It was found by Albert Kitson, a British mine engineer.

The mining sector contributed only about 0.15% to Nigeria's GDP in 2015, a far cry from the 4-5% it contributed in the 1960s and 1970s. Mining, where it has taken place, has often been carried out by illegal artisanal miners working in unsafe conditions.

## An in-depth look at the current state of mining in Nigeria
An in-depth analysis on mining in Nigeria. By Guest Contributor. Oct 27, 2020. The economy in Nigeria has been growing slowly since the oil price slump of 2014. Since then, volatility of global oil prices has negatively impacted growth performance. Between 2000 and 2014, GDP grew at an average of 7% annually.

Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable. Placer mining is used in river channels, beach sands, or other
