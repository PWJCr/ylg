## Gyratory Crushers - Sandrock Mining
Sandrock Mining Gyratory crushers are frequently used in the primary crushing stage and a little less often in the secondary stage. Gyratory crushers have an oscillating shaft. The material is reduced in a crushing cavity, between an external fixed element (bowl liner) and an internal moving element (mantle) mounted on the oscillating shaft
