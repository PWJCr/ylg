Milling Process, Horizontal & Vertical Milling Machines Definition. Milling is a process performed with a machine in which the cutters rotate to remove the material from the work piece present in the direction of the angle with the tool axis. With the help of the milling machines one can perform many operations and functions starting from small objects to large ones.

These types of milling cutters have the cutting teeth on the both sides. We use end mill more in the vertical milling processes. High speed steel or the cemented carbide are used to create end mills. High speed steel is also called as HS or HSS. The high speed steel doesn't loose its hardness when the temperature increases.

Vertical Milling. Vertical milling machines have the spindle in vertical position or parallel to column phase, mounted onto a sliding head for more complexity. The most common tool used in vertical milling is the end mill or a flat-bottomed cutter. In some cases, it may refer to round-nosed cutters as well. Horizontal Milling

A vertical milling machine's spindle axis is aligned in a vertical manner to the machine's bed. That means that the cutting tool is arranged vertically to shape the metal or other material into the desired form. The vertical mill moves while the part remains stationary. The vertical mill has controlled movements, either mechanically (by hand

## Horizontal vs Vertical Milling: What's the Difference? - OneMonroe
