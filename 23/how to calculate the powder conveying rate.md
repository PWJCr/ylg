## Pickup Velocity for Pneumatic Conveying | powderbulksolids
The velocity of the air necessary to convey a material in suspension flow depends mainly on the particle properties of size, shape, and density. For fine powders the minimum conveying air velocity required will be in the region of ft/min; ft/min for cement; and ft/min for fly ash.

Dilute-phase conveying basically means suspending powder in a continuous stream of air. It's most suitable for low-density materials that are not abrasive, heat-sensitive or fragile and that need to move at a high rate; to make dilute-phase conveying work requires an airstream of between 5,000 and 8,000 feet per minute.
