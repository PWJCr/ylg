## What about humic acids? - HumicVet
Humic acid structure. Humic acid can be defined as an organic matter obtained by decomposition and having a long molecular chain with a high molecular weight. Humic acid is insoluble in strong acids and has a pH below 2, dissolving only in an alkaline medium. Why are humic acids valuable? Humic acids have long been used to stimulate plant growth.

##  Plant Health and Soil Changes with Humic Substance Applications
Humic substances compose up to 80% of soil organic matter (Brady & Weil, 2008). Carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur are the most common elements in humic substances (Pettit, 2004). As shown in Figure 1, there are three solubility-determined classifications of humic substances; fulvic acid, humic acid, and humin (Pettit, 2004).

## Humic Acid and Seaweed Extracts: A Powerful Combination
Using a combination of humic acid/seaweed helps the plants build a reserve of SOD and keeps the plants growing at peak efficiency. Using kelp and humic acid together is a wise choice and it can even help save money. Concentrated seaweed extracts are much more expensive than humic acids. So the 5:2 ratio of humic acid to seaweed is a very good deal.

## How to Use Humic Acid for Plants - Global Garden
It's easy to learn how to use humic acids for plants. HA provides a number of benefits to plants and their growing environments. You can break these benefits into three main categories: chemical, biological, and physical. Combined, these benefits lead to increased plant growth, increased vigor, and increased yields.

Now if you want some potassium silicate to emulsify your foliars, then AgSil is your best bet. OMRI certified but I know it's organic status is debated heavily. Rice hulls also are a great source of silica and provide aeration to your soil. As for humic/fulvic acids, I don't think people understand what it is.

## Humic Acid Structure and Properties - PhelpsTek
This liberates humic acid molecules from contaminants such as clay, shale, gypsum, silica, and fossilized organic matter found in the ore. These make up about 15% of the ore. Of course, not all of the remaining humic acid is active. Some is irreversibly combined with crystallized minerals and some is polymerized into insoluble molecules

## Free Humic Acid and Anchored Onto Silica Gel Surface: a Thermodynamic 
Humic acid (HA) obtained from Brazilian peat soil w as attached onto silica gel previously modified with 3-aminotrimethoxysilane to produce a material named SiHA. Thermogravimetric data showed that the anchored HA has a significant increase in its thermal stability. Whereas natural HA presents a thermal st abili y up to 240 C, the anchored compound presents a thermal stability near 800 C.

## The fouling potential of colloidal silica and humic acid and their 
The fouling propensity of an inorganic colloid (silica) and an organic (humic acid) and their mixture was studied in this paper. Fouling propensity was characterized as the modified fouling index (MFI UF) and specific cake resistance in dead-end UF at constant pressure.Experimental results for individual foulants demonstrated that MFI UF increased linearly with increasing particle
