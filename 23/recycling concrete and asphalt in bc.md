Since concrete is extremely heavy, it makes little sense to rent a full-sized 20- or 40-yard dumpster. They're not meant for hauling extremely heavy loads, and they cost more than smaller bins. Rock boxes are typically sized at 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, or 15 yards. Not all trucks can safely and legally carry 15-yard rock boxes.

## Asphalt
Asphalt, also known as bitumen (UK: / ˈ b ɪ tj ʊ m ɪ n /, US: / b ɪ ˈ tj uː m ə n, b aɪ-/), is a sticky, black, highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch.Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos.
