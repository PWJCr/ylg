## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing?
Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor crusher or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that
