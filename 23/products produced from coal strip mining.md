## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
In 1950, underground mines, most of them in Appalachia, produced 421 million short tons, or 75 percent of US coal. Surface mining has since overtaken underground mining, accounting for 64 percent of production in 2016 . In 2016, the largest single source of US coal was Wyoming, with most of it coming from the enormous Powder River Basin [6] .

## Strip Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Andrew P. Schissler, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004 2.3 Strip Mining. Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced, called spoil handling.

Strip mining is used for mining phosphate fertilizer in Florida, North Carolina, and Idaho, and for obtaining gypsum (mainly for wallboard) in western states. However, the most common association of strip mining is with coal . The examples of decimated land in Appalachia have motivated calls for prevention, or at least major efforts at reclamation.
