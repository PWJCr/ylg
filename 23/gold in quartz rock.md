## 5 Rocks That Contain Gold (and Where You Can Find Them)
The rocks are found on the earth's surface everywhere in the world. The likeliest places are water sources where erosion can occur, including riverbeds, coasts, and ponds. 2. Igneous Rocks. The rocks are primarily metal-bearing ornamental rocks. In some cases, gold particles in the rocks are visible to the eye.

## Gold: The mineral native Gold information and pictures
The color of pure Gold is bright golden yellow, but the greater the silver content, the whiter its color is. Much of the gold mined is actually from gold ore rather then actual Gold specimens. The ore is often brown, iron-stained rock or massive white Quartz, and usually contains only minute traces of gold. To extract the gold, the ore is

Gold in quartz is one of the most collectable forms of natural gold. Unlike gold dust and nuggets, gold bearing quartz is still encased in the quartz rock, creating a natural high contrast display of beautiful gold with white quartz. Mineral collectors will gladly pay many times the gold value for certain specimens.

## Why is gold frequently located in quartz rock? - Quora
Answer (1 of 4): Very generally because the solubility of silica and gold in high temperature (hydrothermal) solutions are affected by the same thermodynamic controls at lower temperatures. That is, where both are soluble in higher temperature water (say 300+C degrees), their solubilities drop

Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm. Without exact measurements, this test is more promising than conclusive, but gold will stick out like a sore thumb if you have another, similarly-sized piece of quartz for comparison.

Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander.
