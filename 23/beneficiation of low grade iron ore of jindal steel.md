## Beneficiation of Low Grade Iron Ore: Beneficial to whom?
Nearly 17 per cent of total iron ore produced in India is of low grade. In India, steel mills are known to use premium iron-ore grade of 62 per cent and above; while ores of lower grade, i.e. FE content 58 and below, are preferred for exports. The committee has recommended penalty for failure to adhere to the mandate too.

## Characterisation and Beneficiation of Low-Grade Indian Iron Ore Fines
Indian iron ores with less than 62 per cent Fe are currently unexploited, except for a few sectors which export them to foreign countries. It is anticipated that by 2012 the country's domestic steel production is likely to rise to the tune of 60 million tonnes per annum. To meet this requirement, it is necessary to utilise not only the existing high-grade deposits but it is also necessary to
