## Effects of Crushed Oyster Shell on Strength and Durability of Marine 
results showed that the addition of proper amounts of COS, FA and BS has positive effects on the strength and durability of marine concrete, but excessive COS may have negative effects. Hence, the combined addition of COS, FA and BS up to a certain optimum COS content is a promising way of producing a higher performance and greener marine concrete.

## The effect of slag addition on strength development of Class C fly ash 
This paper presents the effect of slag addition on strength development and workability of fly ash/slag based geopolymer (FASLG) concrete cured at normal temperature. Class C fly ash with high ferrite (Fe) content was used as the primary material. The proportions of fly ash (FA) to slag (SL) are: 1 FA : 0 SL, 0.9 FA : 0.1 SL, 0.7 FA : 0.3 SL
