Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.
