## Abnormal temperature rise of jaw crusher bearings? Pay attention to 
It is a movable jaw bearing, which supports the movable jaw to swing when the eccentric shaft rotates. Two pairs of bearings transfer the crushed material load to the frame when the crusher is running, and are one of the important parts of the jaw crusher. Reasons for bearing damage: For the jaw crusher, the role of the bearing is self-evident

## Lubricating crushing machines in quarries - Rock to Road
The actual crusher can be in the form of a cone, gyratory, impact, jaw, etc. - type machine. Common to all crushers is the requirement for lubrication, be it oil lubrication (e.g. for gear boxes) or grease (e.g. for bearings). The pure nature of crushing rocks produces many possible issues and considerations to tend with on a daily basis.

## Jaw Crusher Lubrication Knowledge Analysis | - DC Velocity
Since the large and medium jaw crusher bearings and the eccentric shaft are pressure cycle lubrication, when the oil pump fails, the jaw crusher needs to swing the power for 15-20 minutes to stop, so it is necessary to press the oil pump to apply oil to the bearing. Keeping it lubricated, there is no accident of burning the bearing. 3.
