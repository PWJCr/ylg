## Methods of Gold Mining - Geology In
Other gold mines use underground mining, where the ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts. South Africa has the world's deepest hard rock gold mine up to 3,900 metres (12,800 ft) underground. At such depths, the heat is unbearable for humans, and air conditioning is required for the safety of the workers. The first such mine to receive air

## Gold Mining Methods
Placer mining takes a variety of forms, including panning, "sluice-boxing", hydraulic mining, and dredging. All of these techniques use gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the lighter sand and gravel. Some modern commercial placer operations are quite large and utilize heavy equipment and river diversions.
