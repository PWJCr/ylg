Quartz is present as very small size grains in siltstone and shale. Sizes and shapes of grains are important variables in sandstones. Indiana produces building stone from sandstone. We also produce pure quartz sand used to make glass. Quartz can form by precipitation from low temperature waters with or without organisms.
