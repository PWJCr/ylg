## Conveyor Belt Systems - Safety Measures | Bit Rebels
Keeping conveyor belt surfaces clean is crucial, not just for the proper running of the machine, but as a safety precaution. Loose items like paper pieces could find their way to the inner parts of the conveyor belts and cause jamming. Once the machine jams, its components can be out of alignment and pose a danger when switched on before repair.

Look at the conveyor belt in the direction of belt travel and steer the idlers in the same way as bicycle handlebars until you move the conveyor belt to the desired position. The training effort is caused by the friction force of the scruffing action of the conveyor belt as it passes over the cocked idler.
