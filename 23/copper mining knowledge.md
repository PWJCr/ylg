Recycled copper is identical to mined copper. Mining & Recycling Nearly 28 million tonnes of copper are used annually. Copper production begins with the extraction of copper-bearing ores in mining or recycling of scrap metal. The ores are processed into copper concentrate, which can be further treated onsite or sold to a smelter.

What is Financial Modeling For Mining Projects? Mining projects require a unique type of financial modeling, as they contain extensive geological and engineering information.To build such a model, an analyst needs to gain access to a technical report (such as an NI 43-101, feasibility study, or preliminary economic assessment), and model out the mining and milling schedules based on those reports.

## Mining | National Geographic Society
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
