## Engineered stone
As with any silica-containing stone, silicosis can result from breathing dust produced when cutting or processing engineered stone made with quartz. The risk of inhaling quartz dust can be mitigated by taking appropriate safety precautions. [10] [11] Risk of silicosis is high when little or no safety precautions or protective equipment are used.

## Why We Need Silica in Our Drinking Water — URBAN WELLNESS
Silica is widely-know as the beauty mineral because it is a building block of collagen - it provides integrity, firmness and elasticity to skin and connective tissue. There are also promising studies about the efficacy of water-soluble silica in helping to eliminate aluminum from the body, and the implications of that for fighting Alzheimer's.

Accelerated silicosis results from short term large amounts of inadequately protected exposure to silica (5-10 years exposure). This was once rare, but is becoming more common in engineered stone workers and is the main reason for this alert. Chronic silicosis results from long term exposure to low levels of silica (10+ years).

Crystalline silica is in engineered stone, quartz, granite, and other stone products. Cutting, grinding, chipping, sanding, drilling, and polishing these products can release hazardous levels of small silica particles into the air that workers breathe. Engineered stone has the most silica so it can produce higher levels of silica dust.

##  Silica (quartz) Silica, SiO2 - California State University, Los Angeles
Silica (quartz); is a naturally occurring minerals that can be found in mines and use in the fabrication of stone and clay products. Silica is odorless and various in color. Silica - comes from silicone after it oxidizes. It helps form most hard things like glass, porcelain, and some concrete. Its found natural in flint, quarts and opal.

Crystalline silica has been classified as a human lung carcinogen. Is flint the same as silica in pottery? The terms flint, quartz and silica have come to be used interchangeably in ceramics and you will see them all employed in recipes; they are all the same thing. However, most correctly, the material used in ceramics is called simply "silica".

Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it
