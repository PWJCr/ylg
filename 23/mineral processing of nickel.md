Copper Solvent Extraction. The separation of copper from nickel is based on the fact that there is an appreciable difference in the pH at which the two metals are extracted. Copper can be extracted, with very small amounts of nickel, at pH 6.0 to 6.5, while nickel is extracted from the copper raffinate at pH 8.0 to 8.2.

Water is essential to mineral processing. It is used in various steps in the process to recover valuable metals from ore. The water use is quite high - for example, around 1600 litres of water are used to obtain the 19 kilograms of copper found in a medium-sized family car. Water is not always readily available for processing operations.

The Mond (or Carbonyl) Process is the most common and efficient method to treat nickel sulfide. In this process, the sulfide is treated with hydrogen and fed into a volatilization kiln. Here it meets carbon monoxide at about 140F° (60C°) to form nickel carbonyl gas. The nickel carbonyl gas decomposes on the surface of pre-heated nickel

From 50 kg of geothite mineral, they extracted 2-3 kg of nickel using sulphuric acid leaching. Of course, it still needs improvement. Fortunately, we have one of the emerging mineral processing technology, namely Step Temperature Acid Leach (STAL). STAL technology is developed by PT. Trinitan Metals and Minerals (NBRI also visited part of this
