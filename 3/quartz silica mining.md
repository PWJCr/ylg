## Silica | Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety
Silica is a common naturally occurring mineral, also known as silicon dioxide. One common type of crystalline silica is quartz. Silica can be found or manufactured in different forms, broadly divided into crystalline and non-crystalline (amorphous). This information focuses on respirable crystalline silica, which is the more hazardous form.

With high-purity silica and correspondingly low levels of impurities such as boron, iron, phosphorous and aluminum, Horse Creek creates minimal by-products and requires less energy to process.

Silica is mined by opencast methods and extracted as silica sand or as lumps from pegmatites (frequently as a co-product of feldspar and mica), quartz massifs, veins or quartzites. Silica is produced synthetically, as a by-product of the zirconia fusion process and zirconium basic sulphate process.

Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.
