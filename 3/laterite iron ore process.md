## Laterite
Laterite is both a soil and a rock type rich in iron and aluminium and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content. They develop by intensive and prolonged weathering of the underlying parent rock, usually when there are conditions of high temperatures and heavy rainfall with alternate

## Process for extraction of nickel and cobalt from laterite ores
A process for the extraction of nickel and cobalt from a laterite ore comprises the step of reacting the ore, in slurry form, with sulphur dioxide to convert the iron, nickel and cobalt in the ore to soluble sulphates and bisulphites in a product slurry. In a specific embodiment of the process, the product slurry is further treated to convert the bisulphites to sulphates and to precipitate

Laterite nickel ore is an ore by long-term weathering of ultrabasic rocks containing magnesium and iron silicate mineral. During the weathering process, Mg and Fe in the lattice of silicate were partially substituted by Ni gradually, to form the mineral deposit with different contents of nickel and gangue composition.

The range of process options is limited by the nature of the ore. Being oxides, laterites are not amenable to conventional concentration processes, so that large tonnages must be smelted. In addition, they contain large amounts of water (in the range of 35 to 40 percent) as moisture and chemically bound in the form of hydroxides.

The SX-EW Method. SX-EW, or the Solvent Extraction - Electrowinning approach to lateritic ore beneficiation, is a hydrometallurgical method that relies on leaching, extractants, and electrowinning to produce nickel from ore. This process is often referred to as Leach Solvent Extraction - Electrowinning for its employment of a leaching step.

## How To Extract Metal From Ore? - Realonomics
An ore is a rock that contains enough metal to make it worthwhile extracting. The ore is crushed then ground into powder. The ore is enriched using a process called froth flotation. Unwanted material (called gangue) sinks to the bottom and is removed. What is extraction of ore?

## For iron ore pellets?c.norushcharge
What are steel pellets used for? Pellets are small and hardened iron balls with a diameter of 10-20 mm and are used as raw material for iron/steel manufacturing.The pelletizing process was commercially introduced in the world market in 1955, following the World War II scarcity of high-grade natural iron ore in the United States.

## WOA1 - Method for processing laterite nickel ore with direct 
﻿The invention relates to the field of non-ferrous metallurgy and specifically to a method for processing laterite (oxidized nickel) ores with the direct production of ferronickel in the form of metal granules. The method comprises mixing the ore with a solid reducing agent and with fluxing additives, briquetting the resultant mixture, a reduction firing of the briquetted charge in tubular
