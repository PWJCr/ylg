The researchers are using, as tiny factories, the alfalfa's natural, physiological need to extract metals from the medium in which they are growing. Of most value here is that the alfalfa extracts gold from the medium and stores it in the form of nanoparticles - specks of gold less than a billionth of a meter across.

## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e. gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as color) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calverite (AuTe), aurostibnite (AuSb

In the well-known Greek legend the touch of King Midas would convert anything to metallic gold. Recently, a team working at SSRL lead by Professor Jorge Gardea-Torresdey from the University of Texas at El Paso have shown that ordinary alfalfa plants can accumulate very small particles (nanoparticles) of metallic gold ( 1 ).

Gold salts are readily reduced to elemental gold, and chemical methods for making gold nanoparticles have been known for a long time, but only in recent years has accurate control of nanoparticle size been achieved (4, see also discussion in 1).Unfortunately, many of the new methods have proven to be cumbersome or give rise to toxic side-products, and a need to develop better methods is indicated.

Ordinary plants, acting as tiny factories, may provide a better means of production. All ordinary plants use their roots to extract nutrients - water and minerals, even heavy metals - from the soil they grow in. In this case, alfalfa was chosen as a model plant system for studying the ability of plants to extract gold from various growth media.

## extraction of gold from live alfalfa plants
Plant extracts from live alfalfa, the broths of lemongrass, geranium leaves and others have served as green reactants in Ag NP synthesis (Torresdey et al., 2003, Shankar et al., 2003b, Shankar et al., 2005). The reaction of aqueous AgNO 3 with an aqueous extract of leaves of a common ornamental geranium plant, P. graveolens, gave Ag NPs after 24 h.

Harvesting Gold Nanoparticles WIth Alfalfa PlantsSlashdot. Aug 20, 2002In this case, alfalfa was chosen as a model plant system for studying the ability of plants to extract gold from various growth media. AFAIK alfalfa is a fastgrowing and quite easy plant, so it makes sense to use it as a model plant. Inquire Now

## International research team uses alfalfa plants to harvest 
The researchers are using, as tiny factories, the alfalfa's natural, physiological need to extract metals from the medium in which they are growing. Of most value here is that the alfalfa extracts gold from the medium and stores it in the form of nanoparticles -- specks of gold less than a billionth of a meter across.
