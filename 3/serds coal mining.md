## Coal mining | GeoKansas - University of Kansas
In southeastern Kansas, ditches were dug as much as 100 feet deep to reach the coal. One of the world's largest power shovels, Big Brutus, was operated 24/7 in Cherokee County from 1963 to 1974. It is now the centerpiece of a museum featuring the southeast Kansas mining industry. Strip mining creates deep ditches and high ridges.

At Rainton, four miles west of Seaham, coal is just below the ground. A few hundred yards away to the east at Hetton, at the start of the limestone escarpment of the Durham Plateau, the coal is several hundred feet below the surface. It was there on December 19, 1820 that the new machinery was put to the test.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Coal Mining and Labor Conflict | Energy History - Yale University
Coal camp living conditions were often squalid, with social life dominated by the company and basic freedoms of speech, movement, and assembly restricted by private mine guards and company-paid sheriffs. Mining coal was incredibly dangerous work. During the industrial coal boom between 1880 and 1923, more than 70,000 miners died on the job.
