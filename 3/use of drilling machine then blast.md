## What is DTH Drilling? | Furukawa FRD
As the drill string slowly rotates, the drilling hammer is forced into the rock repeatedly. Striking power is provided by compressed air driving a piston inside the hammer. Where is it used? DTH drilling is often used in the mining industry (blast hole drilling), on construction sites, drilling water wells, and in the oil and gas industry.

## How to Use a Drill : 8 Steps - Instructables
Step 5: Drill the Hole. Make sure the tip of the drill bit is touching the material before you start drilling, and that the drill bit is held at a reasonable angle. In most cases, when going straight through the material, this means that the drill bit will be perpendicular to the material. Pull the trigger and start drilling slowly.

Insert the drill bit into the chuck. After selecting the right bit, you need to insert the bit into the chuck of the drill machine. To open the chuck rotate it anti-clockwise until the bit can fit inside. Now rotate the chuck clockwise to tighten the bit in the chuck. First, do it just by hand and then tighten properly by using the chuck key.

## What You Need To Know About Drilling and Blasting
Aug 18, 2021What is drilling and blasting? This is a process followed to break rock for excavation purposes, via controlled use of explosives and other methods such as gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics. Drilling and blasting is practiced most often in mining, quarrying, and civil engineering projects. The result of rock blasting is often known as a rock-cut.
