## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
Crushed ore is fed to the ball mill through the inlet; a scoop (small screw conveyor) ensures the feed is constant. For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged.
