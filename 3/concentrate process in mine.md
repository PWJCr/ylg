However, REE in the concentrate (3.97%) and in the tailing (3.75%) was not desirable, not only for the separation of fluorspar to silicate but also for the recovery of REE in the global process. Therefore, a magnetic separation was added before flotation to improve the purity of fluorspar (from 75.4 to 81.7%) and to decrease the REE minerals

The production of concentrates implies the crushing and later milling of the ore down to a particle size allows releasing copper by flotation. The concentrates from different regions have approximately between 24% up to 36% of copper. Copper concentrates are then submitted to a final filtration and drying process to decrease the humidity to 8-9%.

The spodumene moves to a dryer and kiln that operate at about 1,000°C. This process converts the mineral into an easy-to-extract form using acid. This stage in the process also has the potential to release chemicals in the environment, some of which can be attributed to the fuel quality, calciner design, and emission abatement steps.
