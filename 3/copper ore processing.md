The process choice of copper ore flotation is determined by the raw ore properties. Problems that need to be considered when processing. Meanwhile, there are many determined factors for copper ore flotation process, like the mineral disseminated particle size, the associated relationship with quartz rock and the gangue mineral types.

## In hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of copper?
Which process are used for extraction of copper? The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulfate ores. Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper.

Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

Copper Ore Processing Methods. The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore

## How To Smelt Copper Ore - Realonomics
First the ore is treated with dilute sulphuric acid. This trickles slowly down through the ore over a period of months dissolving copper to form a weak solution of copper sulphate. The copper is then recovered by electrolysis. This process is known as SX-EW (solvent extraction/electrowinning). How do you smelt raw copper in Minecraft?
