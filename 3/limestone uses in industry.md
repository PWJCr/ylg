## limestone uses in industry
In many uses, lime reacts more quickly than limestone but is more expensive, because a high temperature is required to produce it from limestone. Uses of limestone and lime. Figure 1 Principal uses of limestone and lime. The principal uses, by far, of limestone and lime are in the construction industry and cement making.

## What is limestone? What are the uses of limestone? - Huada diamond
Feb 12, 2022Limestone is a common carbonate sedimentary rock. It is mainly composed of calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). When these minerals precipitate from water containing dissolved calcium, they form limestone. This can be achieved through biological and abiotic processes, although biological

## Lime in the Steel Industry | Graymont
Among the many uses of lime in the steel industry, three stand out: Lime is used to convert iron into 'pig iron'. In the blast furnace, finely ground or granular limestone (with a low sulfur and alkali content) is used together with finely ground lime to convert ore into pig iron. The pig iron is later processed into steel.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
