## Crushed Stone & Clear Stone | Greely Sand & Gravel Inc.
The grey, angular stone commonly called gravel is usually limestone that has been crushed to achieve a desired size. Crushed Stone is gravel that includes pieces of all sizes usually from ⅞" all the way down to stone dust. The pieces are all mixed together, allowing them to compact together, creating a strong and stable surface.
