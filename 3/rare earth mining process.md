## Ionic kicks off mining licence application process for Makuutu Rare 
2 days agoIonic Rare Earths has initiated the Mining Licence Application (MLA) process for the Makuutu project in Uganda. The MLA will focus on the Makuutu Central Zone (MCZ), within Retention Licence (RL) 1693, and will provide the basis for initial mining at Makuutu, containing an Indicated Resource of 259 million tonnes at 740 ppm TREO-CeO2.

## Not So "Green" Technology: The Complicated Legacy of Rare Earth Mining
Aug 12, 2021For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

About 35% of the world's reserves of rare-earth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

## Mining Rare Earth Elements, the Environment, Tech, and the  - ETEKLY
The process of mining REEs is ecologically devastating. Processing one ton of rare earth metals releases 2,000 tons of radioactive materials, carcinogens, toxic compounds, acids, and other pollutants into the environment. Since thorium and uranium often occur alongside REEs in nature, tailings from mines tend to be radioactive.

## State Could See Economic Jump From Rare Earth Deposits In Northeastern 
Two companies are working to develop and process rare earth deposits in Wyoming in the face of escalating demand for the valuable elements.  if Western Rare Earths' drilling results in a rare earths mining operation, the operation will need local employees. That timeline is quite a bit longer than the timeline for the Upton facility, but
