## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM)
It is the sector demanding the largest quantity of mercury, with virtually all of the mercury used released to the environment. The sector produces about 12 to 15% of the world's gold. An estimated 10 to 15 million miners, including 4 to 5 million women and children, are involved in the sector. ASGM is a complex global development issue.
