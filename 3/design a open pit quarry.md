Without the right software tools focused on open pit design and with no integration to the block model, building a mine design can be an unenviable task. Manual and spreadsheet calculations are time-consuming, prone to error, and inefficient. Scheduling decisions can be based on inaccurate data.  HxGN MinePlan Quarry Foundation

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

## Selection of Open-Pit Dump Trucks during Quarry Reconstruction
Nowadays and in the near foreseeable future the quarry road transport will be the most common in the open-cut mining method. This is due to a range of advantages of open-pit dump trucks usage as compared with other types of quarry transport, i.e. autonomy, the possibility of using in any mining engineering and climatic conditions etc.

The blasting process must be managed in a way that minimises the risk of the unplanned detonation of explosives, and associated undesired outcomes, and uncontrolled blast behavior at the time of firing.

## The Design Of Quarry Faces And Slopes | Agg-Net
On a quarry slope formed by three 15m faces at 70° with a minimum bench width of 15m, the reserves lost would amount to approximately 10,000 tonnes per 10m of face when compared with a 7m bench width (fig. 4). When this loss is scaled to actual quarry dimensions, very large quantities of reserves are lost.
