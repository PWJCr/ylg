Step 4 - Track Your Belt. Once your belt has the proper tension it's time to steer it so that it doesn't rub on the side of your frame and stays centered on the pulleys. Use the friction on the conveyor's adjustment rollers to guide your belt as opposed to applying more and more tension. For instance, lessening the tension on your tail

Begin to add product and tension the belt as needed until the conveyor will move the heaviest load without the belt slipping. When the belt is no longer slipping, stop the conveyor and place a full product load on it. Restart the conveyor and check for belt slippage. If slippage occurs, repeat as necessary.

## Stress (mechanics)
t. e. In continuum mechanics, stress is a physical quantity. It results when forces like tension or compression act on a body. The greater this force and the smaller the cross-sectional area of the body on which it acts, the greater the stress. So stress is measured in Newton per square meter (N/m²) or Pascal (Pa).
