Once broken into smaller pieces, the charcoal and iron ore (sand) are mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. 4. Charge the furnace. Before adding the iron ore and charcoal mixture, the furnace must be charged. Charging a furnace simply means heating it up to temperatures high enough for smelting to occur.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Vale to build New Steel plant and boost dry iron ore processing aims 
Posted by Daniel Gleeson on 7th February 2020. Vale says it plans to invest up to $100 million to build an industrial plant for dry magnetic concentration of low-grade iron ore, bolstering its efforts to eradicate wet tailings facilities at its mines. The technology, known as FDMS (fines dry magnetic separation), is unique, Vale says, and has
