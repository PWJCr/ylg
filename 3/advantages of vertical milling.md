## CNC Machines for Horizontal vs Vertical Milling
Disadvantages of a Vertical Machining Center. Additional rotary axis reduce travel space and are limited in capacity. Machining only on 1 side per setup (w/o add'l rotary axis) Chips/Swarf pile up in the work zone requiring work stoppage to clean. Machining Capability generally less due to lower rigidity.
