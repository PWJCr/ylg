## How To Calculate Cement, Sand Quantity For Plastering - DAILY CIVIL
Following points should be remembered while calculating the quantity of cement, sand for plastering work. 1. For wall plastering, Cement : Sand = 1 : 6. 2. For ceiling plastering, Cement : Sand = 1 : 4. 3. Thickness of plaster should be in between 12-15 mm. If an additional coat is required then do not do it at one go. 4.

Dry volume = wet volume x one.54. = 233.2 x 1.54. = 359.12 cu.f. The ratio of The Concrete (1:2:4 =7)/n Volume of The Cement. = Quantitative relation of cement / total quantitative relation x volume. = one / seven x 233.2. = 33.31 cft. Put this volume into luggage made of cement. That one is one you are familiar with.
