Natural aggregate is mined mainly from sand and gravel deposited as riverine and coastal terraces during the Quaternary and Tertiary geologic periods. Cretaceous sand and gravel deposits in the Potomac Group are also mined. In the Blue Ridge and eastern Piedmont provinces, sand is extracted at several sites from modern river terrace deposits.

Aggregate materials are either used in their natural state or after crushing, washing, and sizing. The materials can be used loosely, or sand, gravel, and crushed stone can be combined with a binding media to form concrete, mortar or asphalt. The mining process begins with the removal of the overburden to reveal the materials underneath.

What is the Impact of sand mining on inland biodiversity and rivers? The mining of aggregates in rivers can have an effect on pollution and change the level of water acidity (pH). Removing sediment from rivers causes the river to cut its channel through the bed of the valley floor (or channel incision) both upstream and downstream of the extraction site.
