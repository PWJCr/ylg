This process was considered to occur mainly at the crystal surfaces. At higher fluoride ion concentrations (ca. 100 ppm), this exchange was accompanied by partial disintegration of the crystal lattice and the release of fluoride ions. The fluoride ion uptake by hydroxyapatite has been studied as a function of the solution pH (Ramsey et al. 1973).

A selected millimeter-sized fraction of the raw clay was submitted to a series of thermal and hydrothermal treatments in order to obtain a zeolitized surface layer grown onto a hard clay core. The proposed methodology seems to be appropriate for obtaining kaolin-based adsorbent beads for packed-bed columns, avoiding the crystal agglomeration step.

Beneficiation is a process used to improve the quality of kaolin by removing unwanted minerals. Beneficiated kaolin was used as an adsorbent to investigate its performance in removing some pollutants from wastewater. In particular, the emphasis was placed on the reduction of BOD, COD, chloride, total alkalinity, sulphates, chromium, cadmium and
