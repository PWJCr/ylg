The flatter cone angles help to retain the particles longer between the crushing surfaces and therefore produce much finer particles. To prevent damage to the crushing surfaces, the concave or shell of the crushers is held in place by strong springs or hydraulics which yield to permit uncrushable tramp material to pass through.

## Caring for your cone crusher: A guide to optimising performance
A cone crusher punishes itself in every minute of operation. It squeezes a dense mass between heavy castings until the mass disintegrates. It abrades and minces aggregate until the material yields to the applied forces. It rumbles and vibrates and bangs as its core shaft spins eccentrically to capture and reduce chunks of aggregate.

The MSP Cone Crusher features one of the largest volume displacements by a crusher head. When there is a large volume of material displaced this way, it means that more material is crushed in each cycle, more material can be fed to fill the larger void left when the crushing head recedes, and more material flows through the crusher due to the larger throughput and gyrating cycles allowing material to drop further.

Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

## Cone crusher basics in 4 minutes — SRP
The basic principle is straightforward: the material to be crushed (the feed), drops into the crushing chamber. The mantle is a moving part that gyrates in an eccentric motion. That is, it doesn't remain completely centred - it swings slightly as it rotates, continually altering the gap between the mantle and the concave (the ring outside the mantle that stays fixed in place.)

Impact crusher working principle. When the stone falls into the working area of the blow bar (hammer), it is crushed by the impact of the blow bar on the high-speed rotating rotor, and is thrown to the apron for a second impact, and rebounds until the rotating blow bar (hammer) is hit again. This process is repeated until the material is
