Jan 25, 2022The Value of Drill Core and Sample Analysis. By Destiny Ponce 01.25.2022. If you are in the mining industry, you know that drill core can be a valuable material. It can help ascertain if an area is worth mining, what minerals are abundant at the site, and what obstacles may be met if explored further. Mining recently named the Top 10 drill

6 days ago2. Drilling as a Method of Sampling. There are numerous sampling methods but drilling is a primary method. (a) Core or Diamond Drilling. The fundamental method during exploration is diamond drilling where a cylindrical rock mass/core is drilled and fished out. This is the most nearly accurate drilling method.

## Core sample
A core sample is a cylindrical section of (usually) a naturally-occurring substance. Most core samples are obtained by drilling with special drills into the substance, such as sediment or rock, with a hollow steel tube, called a core drill. The hole made for the core sample is called the "core hole".

## Drilling Techniques for Mining Exploration - Equipment & Contracting
With diamond core drilling, a pipe encrusted with industrial diamonds is used to drill through rock layers. A "core" of rock is left in the center of the pipe, which is then recovered as a sample. This core can then be analyzed to determine more about its composition as well as the relationship between rock layers.
