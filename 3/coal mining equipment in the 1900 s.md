## The Hazards of 19th Century Coal Mining | eHISTORY
There were two big engineering problems in mining coal underground: A system to drain water from the mine. A system to ventilate the mine and to provide fresh air to the miners. A special problem in coal mines was the methane (a gas) that sometimes accompanied coal, and which could--and too often did--catch fire and explode. Andrew Roy was one

The nation's coal producers allowed production to skyrocket: output in 1900 was 76% higher than in 1891; 1910 stood 96.7% above 1900 output; and 1918 saw still a 38% increase over 1910 levels. A number of forces in the 1920s conspired to challenge the supremacy of coal.

Coal has been used for centuries for small-scale furnaces. Around 1800 it became the main energy source for the Industrial Revolution; after 1850, the expanding railway system of the industrializing countries, especially the U.S. and Britain, became the major users.Britain developed the main techniques of underground mining from the late 18th century onward with further progress being driven

As a result, coal mines got deeper and deeper and coal mining became more and more dangerous. Coal shafts could go hundreds of feet into the ground. Once a coal seam was found, the miners dug horizontally. However, underground the miners faced very real and great dangers. Even with Watt's improved steam engine, gas flooding was a real problem
