## SteelMint: Odisha iron ore fines index edges up after OMC auction
Apr 23, Reads. 23 Apr 2022, 18:17 IST. SteelMint's weekly Odisha iron ore fines index (Fe 62%) increased by around INR 350/t w-o-w to INR 6,050/t ex-mines. Post OMC iron ore auction in Odisha prices have increased a bit owing to decent response amidst hike in sponge iron and semi-finished steel prices seen earlier during the week.

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China, Australia, Brazil, India and Russia. These countries account for around 85 % of the total global iron ore mining volume.

Iron ore extraction is mainly performed through open pit mining operations, resulting in significant tailings generation [2]. The iron ore production system usually involves three stages: mining, processing and pelletizing activities. Of these, processing ensures that an adequate iron grade and chemistry is achieved prior to the pelletizing stage.

## Iron ore (fines) - Cargo Handbook - the world's largest cargo transport 
Description. Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH).n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3).

##  Fine particle processing of iron ore slimes from Orissa, India
Abstract - The fine particle of processing of slimy tails of iron ore wash plant tails have been addressed either by flotation or wet high intensity high gradient separation. This paper furnishes a few case studies of fine particle processing of some iron ore wash plant slimy tails spread across, Orissa. The
