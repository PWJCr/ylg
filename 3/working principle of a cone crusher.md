## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.

Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers. Gyratory and cone crushers are likely to become jammed

## What Do You Need To Know About Cone Crusher Working Principle
The working principle of the cone crusher is very similar to the gyratory crusher. The shaft of the cone crusher is driven by a powerful motor which forces the axle of the cone crusher wings to swing, so the crushing walls, known as a mantle and a bowl liner, are face to face. This zone is called the crushing zone.

## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.

## Working Principle of Crusher
Crusher. Industrial crushers crush or deform materials through impact or pressure, thereby reducing large pieces of rock, ore, or waste to a smaller size. During the primary crushing operation, the boulder size feed is reduced from 20 to 100 inches to the secondary crusher size of 1 to 20 inches or the ground feed size of 0.5 to 3 inches.

Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.
