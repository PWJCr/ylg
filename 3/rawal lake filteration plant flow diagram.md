The original plan was to build two plants for two main sources of water - the Seymour and Capilano reservoirs. Instead, we proposed expanding the Seymour plant and connecting it to the Capilano Reservoir via two tunnels (seven km long each) and the 1,080 ML/d Capilano Pump Station. This solution saved significant public money and minimized

## Basics of Ultrafiltration | Pureflow
Ultrafiltration, also known as UF, is a class of filtration that uses a membrane, either in the form of a spiral wound element similar to a reverse osmosis membrane, or more often, a tubular element known as a hollow fiber. Other types of membrane filters are Microfiltration (MF), Nanofiltration (NF), and Reverse Osmosis (RO).

The most common example is making tea. While preparing tea, a filter or a sieve is used to separate tea leaves from the water. Through the sieve pores, only water will pass. The liquid which has obtained after filtration is called the filtrate; in this case, water is the filtrate. The filter can be a paper, cloth, cotton-wool, asbestos, slag

##  Filtration - MRWA
The rate of flow on a filter depends on the type of filter. A rapid sand filter will have a flow of 2-3 gpm/square foot of filter area. The high rate filter may have 4-6 gpm/square foot applied to the surface. A constant rate flow valve is almost fully closed when a filter is clean so that the desired water level on top of the filter is maintained.

The membrane filtration processes in water treatment process are reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, microfiltration and nanofiltration. These processes have traditionally been applied to the production of water for industrial or pharmaceutical applications but are now being applied to the treatment of drinking water.
