## Uses of Coal - Industrial and Domestic Uses of Coal - BYJUS
In the steel industry, coal is used indirectly to make steel. What happens here is that coal is baked in furnaces to form coal coke. Once this is formed, manufacturers use coal coke to smelt iron ore into iron and make steel.

## Tackling the challenge of decarbonizing steelmaking | McKinsey
The transition toward clean energy and decarbonization of the fuel mix is one of the most burning topics in heavy industry. The steel industry is one of the top three contributors to CO 2 emissions, and more than 70 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions in the steel industry are directly linked to use of coal as both fuel and reductant. Steelmakers are taking several steps to decarbonize

## which kind of coal required for steel companies
Perhaps no other industry depended on West ia coal more than the Northeast steel factories. Steel production required a clean-burning coal byproduct known as coke. In the early 1900s, approximately 10 to 15 percent of all West ia bituminous coal was loaded into hot-burning beehive-shaped ovens and distilled into coke. Get Price

## Coal Miners - West Virginia
Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.

## High coking coal prices may hit steel companies' margin recovery
Leading steelmakers like Tata Steel had indicated at Q1 earnings calls that their margins, which had come under pressure, would further deteriorate in the ongoing Q2 before improving in the latter half of the year. They attributed the margin recovery, in part, to the declining prices of coking coal which subsided from a peak of over $600 a tonne in March to $210 in August.

Higher-priced coking coal is likely to affect the steel industry's transition to greener production methods as well as the value-based pricing of iron ore. Higher-priced coking coal increases the cost of producing steel via blast furnaces, both in absolute terms and relative to other routes. This typically leads to higher steel prices as raw

Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.

Metallurgical coal or coking coal is a grade of coal that can be used to produce good-quality coke.Coke is an essential fuel and reactant in the blast furnace process for primary steelmaking. The demand for metallurgical coal is highly coupled to the demand for steel.

## The green edge of steel: Cutting through carbon - White & Case
China's Ministry of Information and Technology is readying a five-year plan for all domestic steel makers to lower emissions by switching to electric arc furnaces and recycling more scrap. China's largest steel producer, state-owned Baowu, has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and peak emissions in 2023.

Jul 16, 2014· Another well-known process of steel making is completed with an electric arc furnace. Unlike a blast furnace, an electric arc furnace uses no iron in steel making. Coke and coal are not required during this process, as it uses electricity instead. Coke is often produced away from the steel mills, and is often delivered via railway.
