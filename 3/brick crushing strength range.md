Useful Properties of Bricks. Compressive Strength Generally, bricks have high compressive strength in the range of 5.5 N mm 2 to 140 Nmm 2.. If the crushing strength of the bricks is less than 3.5 Nmm 2 it must not be used. A field test about strength of the bricks is to fall the brick from a height of 1 meter and it must not break in to pieces.

## Test for Compressive Strength of Bricks, Absorption  - CivilSeek
Compressive Strength of Bricks. (2) WATER ABSORPTION TEST (ISS ) (3) Efflorescence Test (ISS ) (4) Dimensions Tolerance Test ( ISS ). (i) Take five random bricks samples and immerse them in water for 24 hours at room temperature. (ii) After 24 hours, take them out, allow them to drain and then clean the surplus water.

## Compression Test on Brick ( Crushing Strength Test) | Lab Procedure
The compressive strength test is also known as the crushing strength test which is an important type of laboratory test conducted on bricks to determine the load-carrying capacity of bricks when subjected to a compressive load. This test is performed utilizing a compression testing machine. 2. Apparatus & Materials Required.
