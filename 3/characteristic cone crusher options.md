## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.

Sep 02 2019 CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary tertiary and quaternary stages.

## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
