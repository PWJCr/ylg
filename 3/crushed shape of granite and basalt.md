## Difference Between Basalt and Granite
Basalt is volcanic, or extrusive, forming at the surface, while granite is plutonic, or intrusive, forming beneath the surface. Basalt is mafic while granite is felsic. Basalt is common on both Earth and other Solar System bodies such as the Moon and Mars while granite is only common on Earth and rare elsewhere in the Solar System.

## Basalt vs Granite: What are the differences? | BuilderBaron
Jun 25, 2022Basalt is made up of pyroxene, plagioclase, and olivine minerals. In contrast, granite is made up of quartz, feldspar, and mica minerals. Both rocks are composed of other minerals as well, but these are the most common. The exact composition of each rock varies depending on the location.

## The Pros and Cons of Decomposed Granite Driveways
There are many downsides to using unstabilized decomposed granite for a driveway. Without proper stabilization, it is not quite as permeable. It will still drain liquid, but at a much slower rate than if the driveway were to be excavated and stabilized with pavers. Also, it actually encourages weed growth if laid over plain grass.

Up to now, there is no specific investigation on the size and number of crushed particles after ballast breakage. Fig. 3 demonstrates the current research process, involving laboratory tests, machine learning models, and DEM simulations. In this study, a dataset of 700 ballast particles was acquired by conducting single-particle crushing tests on granite, basalt and limestone particles.
