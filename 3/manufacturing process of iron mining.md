Blast Furnace - Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF): This is the dominant steel production route in the iron and steel industry, involving the reduction of iron ore to pig iron in the blast furnace. BF-BOF operation relies almost entirely on coal products, emitting ~70% of CO2 in the integrated plant (BF iron making).

## Iron mining in the United States
Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. Although later overshadowed by production from the Lake Superior mines, iron ore mining in New Jersey and New York continued until the 1960s. Iron mining in Pennsylvania ended in 1973.

## Manufacturing Process of Cast Iron Castings
Casting is the process of pouring the iron into a mold thus giving it a shape. Molds and pouring methods divide this process up. Molds can be made as expendable molds (sand) or non-expendable molds (metal). Pouring can happen via gravity, low-pressure or vacuum. Controlling the pouring process becomes more important the more intricate the mold is.

## Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore
Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore. Steel is an alloy consisting mainly of iron, carbon and other elements. According to its carbon content, iron can be divided into pig iron and wrought iron. Pig iron contains between 2.11 and 4.5 percent carbon, wrought iron less than 0.0218 percent and steel between (0.0218 and 2.11 percent).

## Steel making process - ArcelorMittal
There are two main processes for producing steel: by means of a blast furnace (= indirect reduction) in combination with a converter, or by means of an electric furnace. In the former process, iron ore is the main raw material. In an electric furnace, scrap iron is used and occasionally also sponge iron. Sponge is an intermediate product, which
