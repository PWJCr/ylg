## production process of talcum powder
For body powder, powdered corn starch is used as a substitute for talcum powder, and similarly in other health and beauty products.  Today most bioethanol production plants use the dry milling process to ferment corn or other feedstock directly to ethanol. Hydrogen production could use glucose from starch as the raw material, using enzymes.
