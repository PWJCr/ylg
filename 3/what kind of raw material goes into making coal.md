## Industrialisation, Imperialism, and Raw Materials.
Coal made steam power cheap, and changed into coke revolutionised the smelting of iron. Steam-driven iron trains and ships were able to transport coal cheaply and efficiently. Coal's highly concentrated levels of energy cut society's reliance on extensive tracts of land for energy production - whether in the form of woodlands or food for

## what kind of raw material goes into making coal
The raw material formation may begin by separating the hydrocarbon chemicals from natural gas, petroleum, or coal into pure streams of chemicals Some are then processed in a cracking process Here, in the presence of a catalyst, raw materials molecules are converted into monomers such as ethylene ethene C2H4, propylene propene C3H6 .

Coal is converted into electricity through a complex process that involves steaming, grinding, processing and distribution. The act of transforming coal into electricity is quite a production; coal is first ground to a fine chalky powder and added to combustion chambers of boilers before being burned at higher temperatures to produce hot gas and heat energy. Eventually, coal is sent to a

Raw materials. For the production of steel, there is a need for iron raw material in the form of iron ore or scrap metal, together with alloying elements so that the material acquires the desired for properties. In the production of ore-based steel, coal is also needed as a reducing agent and limestone as a slag former.

The five materials most commonly used in shoe production are leather, textiles, synthetics, rubber and foam. 1. Leather. Leather is flexible yet durable, as sturdy as it is supple. It's elastic, so it can be stretched yet it resists tearing and abrasion. It's a breathable material, and it insulates heat, helping to regulate temperature.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon

## What are the types of coal? | U.S. Geological Survey
There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high

Bituminous coal is the most abundant rank of coal found in the United States, and it accounted for about 44% of total U.S. coal production in 2020. Bituminous coal is used to generate electricity and is an important fuel and raw material for making coking coal or use in the iron and steel industry. Bituminous coal was produced in at least 18
