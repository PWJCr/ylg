## Breaking Reason of the Eccentric Shaft of Jaw Crusher
The main part of jaw crusher tilts during lifting process, the eccentric shaft is bent unilaterally. 2. The hardness of crushed materials exceeds the specified standard, which cause the shaft breaking. 3. The long time overload operation of jaw crusher makes eccentric shaft breaking. 4. If the quality of toggle plate does not meet the standard

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
May 6, 2021The jaw crusher discharge opening is the distance from the valley between corrugations on one jaw to the top of the mating corrugation on the other jaw. The crusher discharge opening governs the size of finished material produced by the crusher. Measuring Discharge Opening: Measure distance at bottom of jaws at the point of the crushing cycle when the bottom of jaws is closest together.

The grease used in the jaw crusher should be determined according to the place of use and temperature conditions. Generally, calcium-based, sodium-based and calcium-sodium-based greases are used. The grease added into the bearing housing is about 50% of its space volume, and it is replaced every 3 to 6 months.
