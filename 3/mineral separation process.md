## Magnetic Separation Method - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Magnetic separation has two major applications in mineral processing plants: The removal of tramp iron (which would deleteriously affect subsequent processes) from an ore stream. This is usually achieved by a low intensity magnet suspended above, or at the head of, a conveyor. Separation of magnetic minerals from less magnetic minerals.

## Separation Techniques Used In Mineral Processing
Gravity separation is the main mineral processing method for the separation of wolframite, cassiterite, placer, coal, and manganese ore, and is also widely used in the separation of a rare metal sand mine. the gravity separation is suitable for a wide range of particle size, from hundreds of millimeters to less than one millimeter, and the cost.

## Heavy Media Separation Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The heavy-media separation process, or HMS, employing ferrous media, usually ferrosilicon and/or magnetite, is the most generally used process for sink-float separations. A stable medium over the range of specific gravities from 1.25 to 3.40 can be maintained within close limits and is cleaned and recovered by magnetic means.

In broader terms, mineral processing consists of two functions. Firstly, it involves the preparation and liberation, of the valuable minerals from waste minerals and secondly, the separation these values into two or more products, called concentrates. The term separation in this case is synonymous with concentration.

Separation occurs by the particle movement in response to gravitational forces and the resistance applied by the fluid used for the separation process. This is a cost-effective type of separation. Magnetic separation: This method is used when one of the mineral components has strong magnetic susceptibility, it can be separated from the others.

The separation is done in a separating funnel in a temperature controlled room of 20°C. The "heavy" grains will accumulate in the bottom of the funnel above the pinch clip and the "lighter" grains float to the surface.
