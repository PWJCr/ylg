A diamond may be cleaved along a defect or its tetrahedral plane using simple steel. Lasers and other diamonds can also be used to "break" a diamond. The carbon in a diamond is very hard, but so are other elements such as silicon or germanium. If these other elements are mixed into the diamond, they will change its color or quality.

## What is Diamond Processing? - SLTL
Diamond processing is the practice of changing a diamond from a rough stone into a faceted gem. Cutting diamond requires specialized knowledge, tools, equipment, and techniques because of its extreme difficulty. To the non-professional, an unpolished rough diamond appears to be very much like a dull piece of glass.

## Can You Break A Diamond? - Estate Diamond Jewelry
The first stage of processing a rough diamond is to separate it into the maximum available number of stones. This is done by taking advantage of cleave lines within each rough diamond. A cleave line - a tetrahedral plane, to give it its technical name - is the weak spot in a diamond. As a simple example, wood has a single grain.
