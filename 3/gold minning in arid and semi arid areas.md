## (PDF) Review on analysis of soil moisture changes caused by coal mining 
Coal mining subsidence causes cracks on the ground, coupled with the reduction of groundwater level, which further reduces the already low soil moisture content in arid and semi-arid areas.

## Mapping fractional woody cover in an extensive semi-arid woodland area 
In arid and semi-arid areas, existing global products often underestimate the presence of woody cover due to the sparse woody cover and bright soil background. Case studies on smaller regions have shown that a combination of collected field data and medium-to-high resolution free satellite data (e.g., Landsat / Sentinel-2) can provide woody

## Groundwater Modelling in Arid and Semi-Arid Areas
Arid and semi-arid regions face major challenges in the management of scarce freshwater resources under pressures of population, economic development, climate change, pollution and over-abstraction. Groundwater is commonly the most important water resource in these areas. Groundwater models are widely used globally to understand groundwater systems and to guide decisions on management.

## Hydrological Modelling in Arid and Semi-Arid Areas (International 
Arid and semi-arid regions are defined as areas where water is at its most scarce. The hydrological regime in these areas is extreme and highly variable, and they face great pressures to deliver and manage freshwater resources. However, there is no guidance on the decision support tools that are needed to underpin flood and water resource

## Vegetation greening intensified soil drying in some semi-arid and arid 
The study obtained the turning year when the mean value of NDVI increased significantly in GVG areas through the moving t-test and found that the global turning years obeyed the law that the year is generally later in the arider climate zones, and the median years of Humid, Dry sub-humid, Semi-arid, Arid and Hyper-arid areas were 1996, 1996
