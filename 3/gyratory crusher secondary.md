## Gyratory Crusher Feed Size
A gyratory crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap

## Different types of crushers for distinctive needs - Metso Outotec
Dec 17, 2020Cone crushers resemble gyratory crushers from the technological standpoint, but unlike gyratory crushers, cone crushers are popular in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary crushing stages. Sometimes, however, the grain size of the processed material is small enough by nature and the traditional primary crushing stage is not needed.

Typically, metallurgical operations necessitate greater size reduction and products from primary gyratory crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers for further size reduction. Gyratory crushers, like jaw crushers, reduce size primarily through the compressive action of two pieces of steel against the rock.

## jaw crusher and gyratory crusher | crusher eccentric wearing plate 
Gyratory crusher is a new type of crusher which can replace fine jaw crusher or cone crusher. The gyratory crushing equipment has a bright future in the mineral processing market. Its working part is a high-speed rotary crushing roller, which is coupled with a pair of curved crushing plates arranged symmetrically on the left and the right to

## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl, but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary, tertiary and quaternary stages.
