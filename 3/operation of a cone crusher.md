## Crusher
A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave.

The cone crusher is able to crush hard, medium-hard, and many different types of materials, while providing a reliable and efficient crushing operation. In the beginning, the cone crusher was compared to the jaw crusher as having a more stable structure, higher efficiency, more economical operation and adjustable to much smaller margins.

Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing
