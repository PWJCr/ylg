Follow these steps to make sandpaper at home: Start with a coarse, thick type of paper. Apply a liquid adhesive to the surface. Using a gardening wire sifter, scatter sand over the still-wet surface of the paper. Allow the glue to set until it is no longer sticky. Cover the paper with a wooden board and clamp the paper down.

## What is Manufactured Sand and Manufactured Sand vs Natural Sand
The technical process of preparing high-quality concrete with machine-made sand: 1. Increase the stone gradation and reduce the porosity. 2. Increase the amount of admixtures-fly ash, mineral powder, stone powder, and increase the air content (defoaming agent + air-entraining agent). 3. Reduce cement consumption and water consumption.

## Influence of retempering on properties of concrete made with 
The construction industry is currently dealing with a number of major issues. These include of shortage of river sand and large amount of energy required for manufacturing of cement produces free CO 2 in air, accordingly use of manufactured sand and industrial waste in concrete increases. In construction of hilly topography long carrying of concrete is required, In outside location providing
