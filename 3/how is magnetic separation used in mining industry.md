## How fines dry magnetic separation could solve mining's tailings problem
Mar 19, 2021Apparently spurred on by the catastrophe in Minas Gerais, Vale has worked hard to develop a solution, with other experts close behind. Known as fines dry magnetic separation (FDMS), this approach has the potential to sweep tailings from the mining lexicon forever - keeping miners safer and the environment cleaner along the way.
