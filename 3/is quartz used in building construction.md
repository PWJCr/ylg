## Quartz Versus Granite Countertops - Fine Line Homes
However, there is one related downside to quartz countertops: If they are exposed to direct, unfiltered sunlight for long periods of time, they can discolor. Thus, they are inappropriate for many outdoor kitchen areas. 2. Granite Versus Quartz: Price. The second consideration for most homeowners is the price point of granite versus quartz.

Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium.

Quartz sand that is recently weathered from granite or gneiss quartz crystals will be angular. It is called grus in geology or sharp sand in the building trade where it is preferred for concrete, and in gardening where it is used as a soil amendment to loosen clay soils.

Nuts, bolts, nails and screws. There are many minerals rich in iron. Iron is probably the most important metal used in building. When it is made into steel, it can act as a framework in large buildings and skyscrapers. Bolts, nails and screws are often made of steel but are coated with another metal, such as zinc, to stop them rusting.
