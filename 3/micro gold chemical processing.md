## Gold Alloys - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Gold and silver unite in all proportions, forming solid solutions (or isomorphous mixtures) with properties intermediate between those of the two metals. The first additions of silver do not lower the melting point of gold, and until silver forms 35 per cent, of the alloy, little change in the melting point occurs.
