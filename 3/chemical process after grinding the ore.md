##  12 Laboratory Sample Preparation
Table 12.1 lists some commonly analyzed radioisotopes, their volatile chemical form, and the boiling point of that species at standard pressure. Note that the boiling point may vary depending upon solution, matrix, etc. Often the moisture content, and thus, the chemical composition of a solid is altered during grinding and crushing (Dean, 1995).

Feb 17, 2022This process of size reduction is called comminution. The crushing and grinding process will produce a range of particles with varying degrees of liberation (Figure 2). Any particles that exceed a target size required for physical separation or chemical extraction are returned to the crushing or the grinding circuit.

## Chemical Process After Grinding The Ore
Mineralogical and surface chemical characterization of . 1. Introduction. Comminution of the ore can take up to 30-50% of the total operating costs of mining (Aldrich, 2013, Jeswiet and Szekeres, 2016).The most energy intensive process in the comminution is grinding, for which the operation cost increases with the fineness of the product (Wang and Forssberg, 2007, Jeswiet and
