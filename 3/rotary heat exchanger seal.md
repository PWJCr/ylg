The smart air sealing technology minimises air leakages in the rotary heat exchanger. It also prevents air leakage from the heat exchanger or mixing of supply and extract air streams. All the gaps between the rotor and the casing are protected with special brush sealing. These sealings are reliable, durable and easy to replace.

## Seal Options for Rotary Drums - FEECO International Inc.
Seals are used to stop air leakage into the rotary drum, which can cause the internal temperature to deviate and the process to decrease in efficiency, sometimes significantly. This often results in increased fuel consumption and residence times, inferior product, or even a reduction in throughput.
