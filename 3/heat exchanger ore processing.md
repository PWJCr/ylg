## Understanding the Heat Exchanger in Your HVAC System
The heat exchanger warms the air using the combustion gases. This warmed air is then distributed through the ductwork to increase the temperature in different rooms of the building. The exhaust gases produced during this combustion process are released outside the building via the flue. There are two roles of the heat exchanger in gas furnaces.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

## Heat exchanger
A heat exchanger is a system used to transfer heat between a source and a working fluid.Heat exchangers are used in both cooling and heating processes. The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct contact. They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, petrochemical plants, petroleum refineries
