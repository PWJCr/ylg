## Mixing and Transporting Concrete - Penn State College of Engineering
Mixing concrete is simply defined as the "complete blending of the materials which are required for the production of a homogeneous concrete" (Young, 267). This can vary from hand to machine mixing, with machine mixing being the most common. However, no successful mixture can be achieved without the proper batching of all materials.

Manual mixing method takes a lot of time to produce a mixture and also requires large human effort to mix it. There are many concrete mixers machines which are in existence. However, numbers of these machines are too expensive and because of this small scale construction workers are carried out using tradition method of mixing concrete.

Start by pouring half a bucket of water (aprox. 5l) into the concrete mixer. You will determine the right amount of water with time, because the concrete should have the right consistency. If there is too much water the concrete will be too thin and thus unmanageable. If you use too few water, the concrete, sand and gravel won't mix properly.
