## Zinc oxide tape for verrucasruz.shop
What does zinc oxide tape do for verrucas ? When you get a verruca, you may build up dry skin which hardens and turns into a hard painful lump. If you cover the area daily, 24/7 with a small square of zinc oxide tape, this will trap the water within the cells.This can soften the lump making the verruca less painful.
