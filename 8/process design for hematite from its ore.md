Iron ore is an aggregate of several iron minerals, the main ones being hematite and magnetite.Iron ore and coal were and remain two key components of the Industrial Revolution, since the modern world depends on the mining and refining of iron ore for the integrity of its physical infrastructure: materials for construction, transportation and tools.

This study investigates upgrading of low-grade banded hematite quartzite iron ore (Fe ~31%). Conventional beneficiation was found to be futile. The susceptibility of iron phases to microwave exposure and their selective absorption assists in the liberation of iron values. Microwave exposure of coarse particles at 540 W for 10 min yielded a concentrate with Fe 56.30% and recovery of 50.68%

Nov 9, 2021An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.

## Hematite | Physical - Optical Properties, Occurrence, Uses
Hematite is dense and hard, it is the most important ore of iron because of its high iron content and its abundance.The mineral occurs in various habits: steel-gray crystals and coarse-grained varieties with a brilliant metallic luster are known as specular hematite; thin, scaly forms make up micaceous hematite; and crystals in petal-like arrangements are called iron roses.

Crushed ore is divided into various fractions by passing it over sieves through which undersized material falls. In this way, lump or rubble ore (7 to 25 millimetres in size) is separated from the fines (less than 7 millimetres). If the lump ore is of the appropriate quality, it can be charged to the blast furnace without any further processing.
