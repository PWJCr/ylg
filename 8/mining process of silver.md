## How the Comstock Silver Lode Changed Mining Forever - Provident Metals
Back then, American miners knew very little about silver mining, so they borrowed a process of amalgamation from the Germans (called the Freiberg process). However, the German process was too slow for the Comstock mines, so Almarin B. Paul and other American miners replaced copper pans with steam-heated iron pans, which cut the patio process

Mining sites. Deep sea mining is a relatively new mineral retrieval process undergoing research which takes place on the ocean floor.Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of polymetallic nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 3,000 - 6,500 meters below the ocean's surface. The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain precious metals such as silver, gold

The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. Smelting, or refining, was necessary because silver does not occur by itself in a natural state like some metals. Instead, it is made up of a larger ore body. Thus, smelting, or refining, is necessary to remove other byproducts to get at pure silver. [1]

Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

## Gold Mining Process Development - Denver Mineral Engineers
The standard cyanide leach process consists of grinding the ore to about. 80% - 200 mesh, mixing the ore/water grinding slurry with about 2 pounds. per ton of sodium cyanide and enough quick lime to keep the pH of the solution. at about 11.0. At a slurry concentration of 50% solids, the slurry passes.
