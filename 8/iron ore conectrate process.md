## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.

## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore  - SpringerLink
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

The iron ore processing and production process mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the three-stage closed-circuit crushing is more modern and suitable for high-hardness iron ore crushing and can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation, thereby improving the subsequent grinding efficiency.
