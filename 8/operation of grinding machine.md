## Machining 101: What is Grinding? | Modern Machine Shop
Grinding takes an abrasive — often attached to a wheel — and uses its many grains to cut a workpiece. Variations on this process are useful for a wide variety of applications. On its surface, grinding seems simple: a machine takes a rotating tool (usually a wheel) with abrasive grains and applies it to a workpiece's surface to remove
