The initial process of gold mining starts with prospecting. In prospecting, the ore quality, "vein" geologic formation and ore assaying are examined. An area with a good ore quality is prepared for tunneling. In tunneling, holing and drilling are done using pick and shovel. Others who can afford it use electric hammer jacks.

Surface mining can be destructive to the surrounding landscape, leaving huge open pits behind. In underground mining, ores are removed from deep within the earth. Miners blast tunnels into the rock to reach the ore deposits. This process can lead to accidents that trap miners underground.

## Mining industry and sustainable development: time for change
The common mining practice until very recently could be summarized in a few steps: from obtaining a license, dig the ore, sell the metal, and, once the deposit was exhausted, walk-away and start another mine elsewhere (Jain et al. 2016; EB 2017 ). Not surprisingly, mining is among the human activities with widest environmental and social impacts.

## The Issue of Illegal Mining in The Philippines - GradesFixer
Historically, mining has been known in the Philippines as early as 1521. It was common belief that before the arrival of foreign invaders, native Filipinos have been panning gold and other mineral deposited in many parts of the country. Until now mining industries continue their work to get more gold in many parts of the Philippines.

The 1995 Mining Act allows 100% foreign ownership of mining entities where there is a US$50million dollar investment or higher, via Financial and Technical Assistance Agreements (FTAA). Mines operating under a FTAA have recourse for disputes to be arbitrated offshore, avoiding the cumbersome Philippine legal system.
