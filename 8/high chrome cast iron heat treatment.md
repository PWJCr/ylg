It should be emphasised that this cast iron does not have a high impact strength in its as-cast condition due to the formation of chromium carbides in the structure. This work also proposes a specially designed heat treatment for inoculated cast iron. The parameters of the applied heat treatment were determined on the basis of dilatometric tests.

B. Malleable Iron By a special heat-treatment of white cast iron, iron carbide is separated into iron and free graphite. The free graphite in the microstruc-ture takes the form of irregularly shaped nodules of graphite, Fig-2. This form of graphite is also called temper carbon because it is formed into solid state during heat-treatment.

## Study on the heat treatment process of high chrome cast iron (2)
The heat treatment and healing process of high chromium cast iron is actually a dynamic process of secondary carbide precipitation and dissolution, so the selection of quenching temperature and holding time is very important. At a certain temperature, the higher the quenching temperature is, the higher the hardenability is.

## Heat Treatment of Cast Irons | | Industrial Heating
High-alloy (e.g., high chromium, high nickel-chromium) white irons can be heat treated. For example, nickel-chromium white-iron castings are given a stress-relief heat treatment because, properly made, they have an as-cast martensitic matrix structure. Tempering is performed between 205°C (400°F) and 260°C (450°F) for at least 4 hours.

An austenitizing heat treatment usually comprised heating at temperatures between 750 and 790°C (1380 and 1450°F) with a soak time of 8 h. Air or furnace cooling, not over 30°C/h, was conducted followed by a tempering/stress-relief heat treatment.
