Nov 12, 2021In an interview hosted by the Zimbabwe Independent on Alpha Media Holdings (AMH)'s Heart & Soul Television, Chitando said the outlook for gold mining was bullish after a sudden rise in interest to ramp out output in large-scale miners. Big miners had trailed production from Zimbabwe's 500 000-strong artisanal miners.

Artisanal gold mining was illegal in Zimbabwe from 2006 until 2013, though that didn't prevent individual miners from selling to the black market during that time. In 2014, the government opened up its gold-buying facility, Fidelity Printers and Refiners, to small-scale and artisanal miners, in addition to the large companies that had

Despite this abundant gold wealth, over the past 2 years, gold deliveries have been on a downward trajectory. Cumulative gold deliveries fell to 27.6 tonnes last year, a 16% decrease from tonnage delivered in 2018. Of the 27 tonnes delivered, small scale miners contributed 17.478 tonnes while large scale producers contributed 10.181 tonnes.

But sources in the mining sector say the large-scale miners, who are battling serious foreign currency shortages, are now selling their produce through small-scale miners so that they immediately get foreign currency. Small-scale miners get 70 percent of the revenue for gold sold to FPR in US dollars while 30 percent is deposited into accounts.
