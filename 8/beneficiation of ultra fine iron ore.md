## A Comparative Study of Ultra-Fine Iron Ore Tailings from Brazil
This paper presents a characterization study of ultra-fine solid particles contained in slimes of some iron mines from the Iron Quadrangle, Minas Gerais State, and from the Carajás region, Pará State, Brazil. This characterization is expected to provide a basis for the development and choice of mineral-processing techniques suitable for the tailings characteristics of each mine.

##  Advances in Low Grade Iron Ore Beneficiation - MECON
iron ore is expected to rise by more than 200 million tonne per year to meet the internal demand & export. This additional requirement of iron ore will need beneficiation of low grade ore/fines to get the major portion of increased demand. This paper deals in brief to use of available methodologies for beneficiation of iron ore in Indian context.

## Iron Ore Tailing Beneficiation - a Potential Resource for Future
Tailing beneficiation of iron ore has been addressed either by flotation or wet high intensity high gradient separation. The present study aims to recover iron values from discarded slime containing assay ~56% Fe, ~6.5% SiO2, and ~7.0% Al2O3 from Noamundi processing plant by using high gradient magnetic separator (HGMS).

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

## Iron ore, its beneficiation and agglomeration - Blogger
D. Beneficiation of Ore: Very low grade Iron ore cannot be used in metallurgical plants and needs to be upgraded to increase the iron content and reduce the Gauge content. A process adopted to upgrade ore is called Beneficiation.  Pellets are normally produced in the form of Globules from very fine iron ore (normally -100 mesh)
