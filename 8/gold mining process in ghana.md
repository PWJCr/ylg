The Ghana government too is trying to weed out illegal gold mining.

People have been mining for gold in Ghana for centuries. Long before European colonists set foot in the area in the 1400s, Ghanaians looked for gold with pickaxes, shovels, and pans.  The differing impact of artisanal and industrial mines is related to the process of gold extraction, said study co-author Amanda Payton of East Carolina

Consider its contribution to Ghana's economy. Excluding Ashanti Goldfields' Obuasi mine, which accounts for over 50 percent of Ghana's gold production, small-scale gold miners and galamsey produce between 15 percent and 20 percent of the country's gold.

## A History of Gold Mining in South Africa, Ghana and Tanzania
The ancient kingdom of Ghana was located 800 kilometres north of the modern-day capital city, Accra, crossing into modern-day Mali and Mauritania (Hilson, 2002).At the time, the name Ghana strictly referred to the region's king; however, it was later used by Arab merchants, who traded gold for more than 700 years prior to the arrival of Europeans, to refer to the wider region (Hilson, 2002).
