## Gold Smelting & Refining Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Gold Refining Book Gold can be concentrated and recovered by applying different gold refining process methods and the final product has variable quality. In this way, it is necessary to have a better marketable product so that the incomes can be improved. Then, we have two smelt and cast the gold into bars called bullion or Dore.

Using only the HCl acid (muratic) will normally breakdown the rock/silca which encases the gold. but HCl is also used to remove/dissolve the base metals associated with plated gold. And then further refined by placing the gold recovered into a solution of HCl and bleach, which will dissolve the gold into the solution.

## Can sulfuric acid dissolve gold?idegrillandbar
Add 120 milliliters of hydrochloric acid for every ounce of gold in the container. For 5 ounces of gold, that would be 600 milliliters of HCL. The addition of hydrochloric acid turns the mixture brown and can result in fumes. As the chemicals react and heat up, the gold will dissolve.

## How to Refine Gold: 2 Major Techniques of Gold Refining Process
Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.
