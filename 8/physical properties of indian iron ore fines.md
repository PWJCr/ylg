## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

## Properties and End-Use Functionality of Iron Ore
Unlike iron ore sinter and pellets which are manufactured from iron ore fines and or concentrate, lump can be directly charged to the furnace without any pre-processing. As a result, lump has an inherently higher value compared with fines due to the avoidance of agglomeration costs. Australia is a significant producer of iron ore lump.

Jun 14, 2022In India, during mining and ore processing, ore fine generation is a common phenomenon, in which more than 60% of process ore becomes discarded material.

## Concrete Made with Iron Ore Tailings as a Fine Aggregate: A Step 
The need for low-cost raw materials is driven by the fact that iron ore tailings, a prevalent kind of hazardous solid waste, have created major environmental issues. Although many studies have focused on using iron ore tailing (IOT) in concrete and have reported positive results, readers may find it difficult to accurately assess the behaviors of IOT in concrete due to the scattered nature of
