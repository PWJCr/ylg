## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Learning Technology
The aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. It is expressed as the percentage by mass of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test sample is subjected to a specified load under standard conditions. Aggregates with lower crushing value

## Quality Control
Better adhesion between aggregate and binder; Higher fatigue life of mixes;  an integrated crushing plant should be setup for each Project. Further, introducing shaping unit after secondary crushing stage can control shape of aggregates.  The reduced flakiness index, increase the mix strength and reduces the binder consumption significantly.

## Effect of recycled concrete aggregate features on adhesion properties 
The S 3D value closer to 1 indicates that aggregate looks more like a spherical particle. The S 3D value of a cube-shaped aggregate is approximately 0.81. The S 3D parameter of aggregate can be calculated by Eq. . (2) S 3 D = π A 3 D 6 V 3 D π 3 2. where A 3D = surface area of aggregate particles, mm 2; V 3D = volume of aggregate particles, mm 3.
