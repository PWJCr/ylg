Gypsum rock is first mined or quarried, then crushed and ground to a fine powder. It then goes through a process called calcining where heat at 350 degrees is supplied to the gypsum powder which removes 3/4th of the water molecules. Hemihydrate is the name of calcined gypsum which is then used in gypsum board, gypsum plaster, and other products.
