## What are the Basics for Belt Conveyors Presentation - JMS
A belt conveyor receives product on an inlet or impact area. The material remains static on the belt as the belt itself moves and conveys the material to the discharge point, unlike screw conveyors where the material is mixing and turning while the screw conveys the material.

Belt tension: The belt of the conveyor always experience a tensile load due to the rotation of the electric drive, weight of the conveyed materials, and due to the idlers. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as: Tb = 1.37fLg [2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos (δ)] + (Hgmm)eqn.1.1 Where, Tb is in Newton. f = Coefficient of friction

As mentioned above, slipping can be the cause of a loose belt. However, there is another cause of slipping: mistracking. This happens if the belt is not positioned on the rollers correctly. Mistracking can also lead to improper belt wear and possible breakage. So make sure the belt is correctly set up and aligned.

## Working principle of belt conveyor
Aug 4, 2021The main working principle of the belt conveyor is: the belt conveyor is mainly composed of two end rollers and a closed conveyor belt tightly sleeved on them. The roller that drives the conveyor belt to rotate is called the driving roller; the other roller that only changes the direction of the conveyor belt is called the reversing roller.

## Belt Conveyor Common Problems and Solutions
The adjustment of unloading and redirecting drum is the key to solve the problem of belt deviation. Usually, a belt conveyor has at least 6-8 drums, and all the drums must be installed perpendicular to the center line of the belt conveyor length, if the skew is too large, the belt will run off at the unloading drum or redirecting drums.
