## Investigation of the Use of Quarry Dust as a Substitute of River Sand 
Tests are to be conducted on concrete cubes to review the strength of concrete fabricated from quarry rock dust and the results were compared with the natural sand concrete. In order to satisfy the objectives, this analysis seeks to determine the advantages of using quarry dust over river sand. It is accepted that Compressive strength and

## Effect of Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement of Sand in Concrete 
The reduction in the sources of natural sand and the requirement for reduction in the cost of concrete production has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregates in the production of concretes especially in Concrete. Quarry dust, a by-product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials.

## Can we make concrete using quarry dust as a replacement for sand 
Answer (1 of 8): Of course. Quite a standard procedure. We call it crusher dust, or manufactured sand. Dependent on the source rock and type of crusher, the particle shape is unlikely to be nice round grains, which makes for concrete that is not quite as nice to play with, but it is still far fr
