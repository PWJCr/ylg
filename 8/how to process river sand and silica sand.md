Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it

## Understanding the Difference Between Silica Sand and Washed Sand
Silica sand consists of fine pieces of quartz and other minerals such as salt, silt, clay, dust and various powders.

Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.
