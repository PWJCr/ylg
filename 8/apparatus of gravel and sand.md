## Planted Aquarium Substrate: Soil, Gravel, and Sand
Sand. Sand is a much finer and softer version of gravel. It is made up of tiny particles of rocks, shells, and other earthly materials. Since the granules are so tiny, sand makes the ideal substrate for bottom-feeding fish or fish with soft bellies. The extra fine particles feel much softer compared to other substrates.

Though sand and gravels are construction materials, they have some different characteristics embedded on them. - Particle sizes of soil in gravel range from 4.75mm to 76.2mm, while particle sizes of soil in sand range from 0.075mm to 4.75mm.

The recommendation is 2 inches of gravel for tanks up to 55 gallons, and 3 to 4 inches for larger aquariums. With sand, you want to have 1 inch of sand for tanks with small burrowing fish and 2 inches for larger burrowing fish. A good guideline for most tanks is to purchase 1.5 pounds of substrate per gallon.

## USA - Method and apparatus for separating wood bark from gravel 
A bark and bedding gravel mixture is dumped into a hopper and moves along an inclined vibratory conveyor onto a screening section which screens limbs and other large chunks of wood from the bark-and-gravel mixture as well as sand-sized particles. The limbs and wood chunks are reduced to chips and stored for later use. The sand is conveyed to an aggregate storage site for reuse as bedding material.
