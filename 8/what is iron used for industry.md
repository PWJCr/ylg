## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

## Which Statements Explain Why The Iron Industry Started In England 
The iron industry began to relocate to coal fields which usually had iron ore nearby. . From 1793 to 1815 British iron production quadrupled. Blast furnaces got bigger. In 1815 when peace broke out the price of iron and demand fell but by then Britain had become the largest European producer of iron.

## What is iron and what is it used for? | AnswersDrive
Iron and steel. Pure iron is soft and easily shaped because its atoms are arranged in a regular way that lets layers of atoms slide over each other. Pure iron is too soft for many uses. It is hard, but too brittle for most uses, so most iron from the blast furnace is converted into steel by removing some of the carbon.
