## coal is mining by surface and underground ways
Mining the Coal. Coal miners use giant machines to remove coal from the ground. They use two methods: surface or underground mining. Many U.S. coal beds are very near the ground's surface.

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can be up to 40% of the total coal in the seam - although this coal can sometimes be recovered at a later stage.

## Coal Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The environmental aspects of mining have received little analysis. U.S. coals vary in moisture content (2 to 40%), sulfur content (0.2 to 8%) and ash content (5 to 40%). The energy content varies from lignite to sub-bituminous to bituminous coal. The ORNL-RFF study looks at two levels of sulfur content (0.7% and 2.1%).

## Coal Mining and Labor Conflict | Energy History - Yale University
Mining coal was incredibly dangerous work. During the industrial coal boom between 1880 and 1923, more than 70,000 miners died on the job. Many more perished from occupational diseases, but weren't tallied in official statistics. Miners were crushed to death in roof collapses, killed by gas explosions and by machinery, and more.

Dec 11, 2021The primary underground mining ways are Continuous, Longwall, Shortwall, Retreat and Blast Mining. Longwall mining method is adopted for about 50% of underground mining. This method involves a complex machine with a revolving drum that sways mechanically back and forth across the coal deposit. This method yields high production and ensures safety.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## How Is Coal Extracted?
The two main methods used for coal extraction are surface mining and underground mining. The methods used to extract coal depend on the geology of the coal deposits. According to Energy Trends Insider, the amount of coal produced by one miner in one hour has more than tripled since 1978 because of improvements in mining technology and the growth in surface mining.

Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining. There are two types of room and pillar mining-conventional mining and continuous mining. Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars.
