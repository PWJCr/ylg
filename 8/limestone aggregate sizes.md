## Differences in Grades of Limestone | Port Aggregates
At Port Aggregates, we use top-quality white limestone that has the same durability as gray limestone, but weighs 10% less. This allows for less material to cover more space, saving you money. You will also get to choose your size range, which is where limestone gradations come into play. We offer the following varieties that range for ¼" to
