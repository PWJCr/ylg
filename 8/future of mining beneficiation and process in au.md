It also presents opportunities for development of new entrepreneurs in large and small mining industries. What is mineral beneficiation? Beneficiation, or value-added processing, involves the transformation of a primary material (produced by mining and extraction processes) to a more finished product, which has a higher export sales value.

## Beneficiation
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
