## What You Need To Know About Drilling and Blasting
What is drilling and blasting? This is a process followed to break rock for excavation purposes, via controlled use of explosives and other methods such as gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics. Drilling and blasting is practiced most often in mining, quarrying, and civil engineering projects. The result of rock blasting is often known as a rock-cut.

## Water | Free Full-Text | Investigation of Shock Wave Pressure 
Underwater blasting technology has been widely used in inland waterway improvement projects. However, due to the particularity and complexity of underwater blasting, it is difficult to predict the transmission patterns of underwater blasting shock waves. Therefore, based on the Guoyuan Port Phase II project in Chongqing, the transmission patterns and influencing factors of underwater drilling

Blasting is heavily regulated and watched by federal, state and local agencies. In terms of processing, blasting is the critical first step in the rock-fragmentation process. Maximum profitability depends largely on an optimized blast. Consider that drilling and blasting are the first operations performed in any hard rock quarry operation.
