## Aluminum Mineral Processing and Metallurgy: Iron-Rich Bauxite and Bayer 
All of these conventional techniques cannot recover iron and aluminum from iron-rich bauxite effectively. The reverse flotation process of iron-rich bauxite cannot achieve effective separation of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2, because it is characterized by a high content of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and a low ratio of Al 2 O 3 to SiO 2 (m (Al 2 O 3)/ m (SiO 2

Bauxite is used to produce alumina, which is then used to produce aluminum. Wastes can be generated at several points in the production process, including during the mining of the bauxite ore, and during the refinery production process. The refinery processes used to produce aluminum generates about 2 - 2.5 tons of solid waste for every 1 ton

An electrical current is run through the mixture, causing the carbon from the carbon anode to attach to the oxygen component in the alumina, yielding aluminum and carbon dioxide: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C > 4 Al + 3 CO2. This process takes place at temperatures between º C and yields an aluminum of high purity.

## During refining of bauxite the waste generated is?
Bauxite ore is dissolved in sodium hydroxide, or lye, at a high temperature and pressure. Then, the alumina and bauxite ores are separated by washing out the waste (red muds or sands) from the alumina. What is the end product of bauxite? Bauxite is the principal ore of alumina (Al 2 O 3), which is used to produce aluminum (Al). It is composed

Figure 6-2.—Early Smelting Technology Charcoal ore flux m The Egyptian copper smelting furnace was filled with a mixture of copper ore, charcoal and iron ore to act as a flux. It was blown for several hours by foot or hand bellows. By the end of the smelt the copper had separated from the slag, which was tapped off.Smelting aluminium conventionally requires anodes made of carbon-rich
