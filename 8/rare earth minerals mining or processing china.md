## The collapse of American rare earth mining — and lessons learned
By 2017, it was obvious that in the showdown between Molycorp and China, the Chinese had won. Mountain Pass was now sending U.S.-mined rare earth concentrate to China for processing. The dream of a one-stop American rare earths solution was over, and the private sector had little appetite for reviving it.

## China Controls Global Rare Earth Mineral Trade - IER
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, between 2014 and 2017, the U.S. imported 80 percent of its rare earth minerals from China. The estimated value of those imports in 2018 was $160 million —up 17 percent from 2017 levels of $137 million. While this may seem small in the field of international trade and trade with China specifically, it

This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.
