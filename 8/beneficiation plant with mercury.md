## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## What is the Beneficiation Process?
Size classification will require screening, de-sliming and cycloning. In the case of a lower-grade iron ore, the beneficiation process includes activities such as crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening and silica froth flotation. These activities will help improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.

## Brazil niobium mine exploitation mining beneficiation plant, crusher 
Niobium, formerly columbium, is a chemical element with the symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially.
