## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

Mining sites. Deep sea mining is a relatively new mineral retrieval process undergoing research which takes place on the ocean floor.Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of polymetallic nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 3,000 - 6,500 meters below the ocean's surface. The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain precious metals such as silver, gold

Mining of a diamond-bearing kimberlite generally starts with the excavation of a pit into the kimberlite pipe. In this process, called ''open-pit'' or ''open-cast'' mining, the initially weathered ore material is removed with large hydraulic shovels and ore trucks.

Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.

## Reading: Open-Pit Mining | Geology | | Course Hero
Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where

Open cast or 'open pit' mining is a technique of extracting gemstones, such as Diamond and metal ores, like gold and silver, from the surface of the earth by digging downwards, eventually creating a pit. This method is used when the gems lie near the surface of the ground and the earth covering the gemstones is relatively thin.
