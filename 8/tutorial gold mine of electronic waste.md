However, the UN found that only 15% of e-waste is recycled in an approved manner. Leaving 85% or nearly 7 million elephants worth of e-waste in landfills or being disposed of in dangerous ways. E-waste contains components harmful to people and the environment including CFCs, mercury, lead, and acid batteries.

Rhodium. Rhodium is a silver-white element that is considered rarer and more valuable than gold and silver, and it wastes a lot of resources to mine. Rhodium is commonly used to make electronic contacts and is resistant to corrosion, so it's extremely valuable, but also makes up a huge portion of our electronic waste.
