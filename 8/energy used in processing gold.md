Gold is used to replace or repair teeth and in the treatment of arthritis and other diseases. Lasers in industry and medicine use gold-coated reflectors to focus light energy. History.  The first stage of processing gold ore is crushing. The gold then needs to be separated from the resultant powder.

## Electrolytic processes for gold and other precious metals
Electrolytic Methods Used in Refining Processes of Gold and Other Precious Metals. Electrolysis is an electro-chemical process where an electrical current stream is flowing between two electrodes and through an electrolyte.This process involves the transfer of metal ions through the ionised electrolyte solution, depositing positive ions on the cathode and negative ions on the anode.

## explain the process of efficient gold
A slurry of ground ore, water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved. Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver. This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.

## How addressing energy used in food processing contributes to more 
Industrial food processing technologies need to embrace the cleantech revolution to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable (and viable) world. With an expected world population of about 9.8 billion by 2050 (compared with roughly 7.6 billion today), the carbon impact of the agri-food industry will increase dramatically.

##  The Energy Efficiency Gap and Energy Price Responsiveness in Food 
The IDM uses an end-use approach for modeling the food processing industry. End-use models use a capital stock vintage accounting framework that models energy use in new additions to the stock and in the existing stock. The model assumes that energy intensity decreases for both but that energy intensity of existing stock declines more slowly.

Platinum, which supports chemical reactions, is used as a catalyst in many industrial applications. Silver is used in photographic processing and other processes. Gold is less widely used as a catalyst. If you do find a solution that contains gold that is used in industry, chances are it is used in gold-plating processes.

The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon. Filtering the pulp through screens separates the gold-bearing carbon.

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Gold - Physical, Mechanical, Thermal, and Electrical Properties
Gold's electrical resistivity is 0.022 micro-ohm m at 20 °C, and its thermal conductivity is 310 W m-1 K-1 at the same temperature. The corrosion resistance of gold is possibly one of its most valuable properties. Electrode potentials are a beneficial technique for signifying the propensity of metal to corrode.

## Gold's energy consumption doubles that of bitcoin - Kitco News
Kitco News. (Kitco News) As bitcoin shed $15,000 in less than a week following Tesla CEO Elon Musk's jab at bitcoin's energy consumption, Galaxy Digital released a report comparing bitcoin's energy use to that of the gold industry as well as the traditional banking system. And according to its analysis, gold consumes much more energy than bitcoin.
