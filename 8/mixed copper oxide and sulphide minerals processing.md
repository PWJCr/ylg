Therefore, froth flotation process is the main mineral process method used for the extraction of copper from copper sulphide. The common collector added in the flotation machine used for the extraction of copper from copper sulphide is xanthate collector, followed by aerofloat and its esters.

Three cobalt-bearing oxide minerals are observed in the mixed ore, i.e. heterogenite, kolwezite and cupro-asbolane, while carrollite is the only cobalt-bearing sulphide mineral. A two-stage rougher-scavenger flotation process is used in which sulphides are extracted from the ore first.

## Flotation of mixed copper oxide and sulphide minerals with xanthate and 
Generally copper oxide minerals do not respond well to traditional sulphide copper collectors and require alternative flotation techniques to concentrate the copper oxides. The classical method involves controlled potential sulphidisation (CPS) to sulphidise the surface of the oxide minerals by the addition of a sulphidisation agent, such as sodium hydrogen sulphide (NaHS).

You float sulphides with PAX and them add your Hydroxamate to get oxides (add NaHS if your material responds to the sulfidiser). In a traditional way, sulphide and oxide copper minerals do not recover at the same rate. You typically handle their flotation in a sequential manner: sulphide species #1 followed by oxide minerals.
