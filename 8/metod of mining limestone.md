## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium

Typical Method in Underground Mining: In underground mining, the thickness of the quality seam will determine the number of lifts or layers that can be removed at one time: For thicknesses of up to 10 meters, a single heading will remove all the limestone from the seam. Thicker seams will require multiple lifts to remove all of the quality stone.
