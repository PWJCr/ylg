## Crushed Stone vs. Crushed Gravel: What's the Difference? - Hanson Eagle 
The primary difference between crushed stone and gravel is that gravel is not man-made. It forms naturally from large rocks, which erode over time, creating smaller rocks. As a result, crushed gravel is typically rounder and has a smoother shape than crushed stone. It's frequently used for driveways, landscaping, and even on construction

Aggregates are the major ingredients of concrete. Aggregates are derived from rocks. They are broadly divided into two categories i.e. fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Their properties are depended on the mineralogical composition of the rock. Crushed rocks are used as coarse aggregates are river sand is used as fine aggregates.

When looking at pea gravel vs crushed stone, the key difference is found in the names. Crushed stone is literally rocks that have been smashed, so there is no consistency in the shape, and there are often sharper edges and a rough texture to them. Pea gravel is small, smooth, and more consistent in shape from piece to piece.
