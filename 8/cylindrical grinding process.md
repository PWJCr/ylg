The differences between the processes really come down to the shape you are trying to make. Surface grinding cuts a flat, cylindrical grinding cuts a round. What is centerless grinding process? Centerless grinding is the process of removing material from the outside diameter of a work piece using an abrasive wheel.

## Multi-parameter optimization and control of the cylindrical grinding 
Fig. 2 indicates that the grinding time of Case 3 is the shortest but it is longest for Case 1. Next, because of considering wheel wear in the constrained models, the actual infeed in the spark-out for each case can all reach the control infeed, so the influence of wheel wear in the process of multi-parameter optimization can be summed, and the dimensional accuracy of the workpiece can be insured.

## What is cylindrical grinding operation? - 3Q Machining
The cylindrical grinding process begins with the grinding wheel being fed into the workpiece, and then rotating at high speeds. As it rotates, the wheel cuts off portions of material from the workpiece's surface, creating a profile on its surface. The cylindrical grinding process can be performed wet or dry, depending on the type of material

## Definition of Cylindrical Grinding | Plouse Precision Manufacturing 
Cylindrical grinding is used to shape the outside of an object. This form of grinding is appropriate for a variety of object shapes, as long as the object has a central axis of rotation. A cylindrical grinder uses a constantly rotating abrasive wheel to cut small chips from the workpiece via the process of shear deformation.

## What are the advantages of a cylindrical grinder with centerless grinding?
Centerless cylindrical grinding with a precision lead screw is a rapid and accurate process, and can be used for parts that do not require centers. Additionally, it is effective for parts that are subject to flexing during the grinding process. A precision centerless grinding machine can achieve linear tolerances of 0.005 in all directions.
