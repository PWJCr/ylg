Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.  In roasting, the ore or ore concentrate is treated with very hot air. This process is generally applied to sulfide minerals. During roasting, the sulfide is converted to an oxide, and sulfur is released as sulfur dioxide, a gas.

Sulfides are minerals that contain sulfur. These minerals are inorganic compounds, which means that they are formed through geological rather than biological processes. These minerals are commonly found in soils with a higher temperature. Oxides are those minerals that contain oxide anions, or oxygen, with ice and quartz being the exceptions.

## Characterizing gold in refractory sulfide gold ores and residues 
Gold is present in refractory sulfide gold ores mainly in arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite, where it occurs in both the chemically bonded state and as nano-size grains of metallic gold. During roasting or pressure oxidation, the sulfide matrix is destroyed and essentially all the gold is converted to the metallic form. The liberated gold is readily dissolved in conventional cyanide media

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.

On the northern margin of the Complex, 81.6 million tons of low-grade titaniferous magnetite ore (approximately 12 to 14% TiO 2) occur in 14 bodies that range in size from 1 to 19 million tons. Oxide mineralization along the western contact contains 245 million tons of ≥10% TiO 2. These include the Wyman Creek area, Longnose, Longear, and
