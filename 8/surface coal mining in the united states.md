## Abandoned coal mines for salel-mexicano
A new online inventory that catalogues abandoned and orphaned mines across Canada is now available to the public.. The inventory, released in April, is a project of the National Orphaned and Abandoned Mines Initiative (NOAMI). NOAMI was launched in 2002 in response to a request from mine ministers in federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions to address.

Brook Mine is a proposed coal mine on 14,500 acres of private and state-owned land between Sheridan and Ranchester, Wyoming. The proponent is Kentucky-based Ramaco LLC. The mine features 9,100-Btu coal, slightly higher in quality than the 8,800-Btu coal that is typically mined elsewhere of the Powder River Basin.

Surface mining is used when the coal seam is near the surface. It recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited - 90% or more of the coal can be recovered.

## Surface mining - strip, open pit, mountaintop removal, dredging
The main mineral extracted by this method is coal. Coal is mined by removing the land above the seams. This method of coal mining is mainly conducted on the Appalachia Mountain in the United States. The coal cannot be mined using simple machines. Explosives are used to mine the coal and the excess coals are dumped in the nearby valley.

The United States is the world's second leading producer of coal, accounting for nearly 17% of world production. Minerals are mined either underground or through surface methods like open-pit mining. Approximately 66% of coal and 97% of non-fuel minerals are extracted through surface mining methods.

This handbook is intended as a guide for citizens in the battle against strip-mining. In 1971 the legislature of West Virginia enacted the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (referred to hereinafter as the Act of 1971) which provided citizens with certain legal rights concerning strip-mining.

Coal mining is an industry in transition in the United States. Production in 2019 was down 40% from the peak production of 1,171.8 million short tons (1,063 million metric tons) in 2008.Employment of 43,000 coal miners is down from a peak of 883,000 in 1923. Generation of electricity is the largest user of coal, being used to produce 50% of electric power in 2005 and 27% in 2018.
