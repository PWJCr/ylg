## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

In the third generation tunnel kilns, soft lumpy ores of 10-30 mm size or briquetted iron ores of 32 mm X 25 mm size can be used. In the first and second generation tunnel kilns, iron ore & coal layers were separate. In the new design, iron ore lumps / briquettes and coal fines are mixed together and hence the reduction is faster.

Normally for rotary kiln process volatile matter is to be in the range of 25 % to 30 %. Coals for direct reduction in the rotary kiln need to have low swelling index. Normally swelling index is to be less than 1. The physical and chemical specifications of the non-coking coal are as follows. Size of lumps - 5 mm to 20 mm.
