## Crushed stone
Crushed stone. 20 mm (0.79 in) crushed stone, used for construction aggregate and landscape applications. Crushed stone or angular rock is a form of construction aggregate, typically produced by mining a suitable rock deposit and breaking the removed rock down to the desired size using crushers. It is distinct from naturally occurring gravel

## Crushed Stone Aggregates - Lehigh Hanson, Inc.
Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock, then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their applications; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further processing

## What is Crushed Aggregate? (with pictures)
In areas where natural sand and gravel aggregate deposits are insufficient to handle local demand, larger stones are processed in an impact crusher to create crushed rock aggregate.  The stone must be mined in a quarry and then transported to the rock crusher, which begins the process of crushing the larger stones into more manageable pieces

## How to crush stone to artificial sand? - LIMING(Shanghai)
This can release the lack of natural sand in the world. Then we will introduce you the process of artificial sand making. Second, the aggregates such as limestone, blue stone, gravel, coal gangue, coal, gneiss etc. are evenly fed into the jaw crusher by vibrating feeder for preliminary crushing.
