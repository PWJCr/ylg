Wind-powered machines may have been known earlier, but there is no clear evidence of windmills prior to the 9th century.

## Stability and high performance machining conditions in simultaneous milling
Abstract: An analysis is presented of chatter in machining including the consideration of the basic non-linearity of the process which is due to the fact that with increased vibration the tool starts to move outside of the cut for a part of the cycle. The analysis is carried out in the time domain, by computer simulation.

## Tool condition monitoring in milling using a force singularity analysis 
Force waveforms and tool conditions. The cutting force shows a strong sensitivity to tool conditions [5,6,7,8,9], and it is quite convenient to be acquired during milling.As mentioned above, the basic assumption is that the tool condition varies with the proceeding of the milling process and these variations are related to changes of the cutting force waveforms, as can be seen in Fig. 1.

## Tool condition monitoring in milling using a force singularity analysis 
This paper introduces a cutting force singularity analysis approach for TCM in milling, which correlates tool wear states with force waveform variations and indicates that this approach provides reliable and effective advice for tool change. Tool condition monitoring (TCM) is extremely important to ensure production efficiency and workpiece quality. It is crucial to extract and select suitable

## Analysis of Cutting Forces in Peripheral Milling under Varying 
Cutting force simulation is a crucial tool for estimating the cutting tool behavior during machining. Due to the flexibility of the cutting process and the different variables involved, optimization in the milling process has become a key issue in order to achieve higher productivity and quality.To optimize the process planning, it is important to select an adequate machining strategy.
