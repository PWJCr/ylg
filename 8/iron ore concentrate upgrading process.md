## Smelting process-sirin
Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy to produce a metal from its ore. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, charcoal, and coal.. "/>

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The Iron Ore Process Flowsheet  The hydroclassifier underflow is generally subjected to at least 3 stages of magnetic separation for further upgrading and production of additional final non-magnetic tailing.  are using this method to advantage and future installations will resort more and more to production of low silica iron concentrate
