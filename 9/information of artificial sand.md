What is sand. Sand is a natural unconsolidated granular material. Sand is composed of sand grains which range in size from 1/16 to 2 mm (62.5.2000 micrometers). Sand grains are either mineral particles, rock fragments or biogenic in origin. Finer granular material than sand is referred to as silt. Coarser material is gravel.

## Artificial Sand Making Process - JXSC Rock Crusher
Artificial sand is produced by reducing larger pieces of aggregate into sand-sized aggregate particles. Manufactured sand can be manufactured to be a certain grain size that the buyer chooses, while natural sand can be a mix of coarse and fine grains. Manufactured sand tends to be more angular and flaky due to the crushing process.

## What is Sand - Overview and Geology - Sandatlas
Sand is composed of sand grains which range in size from 1/16 to 2 mm (62.5.2000 micrometers). Sand grains are either mineral particles, rock fragments or biogenic in origin. Finer granular material than sand is referred to as silt. Coarser material is gravel. Majority of sand is dominantly composed of silicate minerals or silicate rock fragments.
