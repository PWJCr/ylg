## How to Choose the Process of Manufactured Sand? Wet or Dry
Dry sand production uses a powder selection system (equipped with a powder separator) to separate sand and powder, to select high-quality sand particles suitable for construction sand. At the same time, the collected dust can also be used as a by-product. It can be seen that the dry process is better than the wet process, but is the wet process

## How to Start a Sand & Gravel Business | Work
A delivery-only sand and gravel business has a lower start-up cost, which includes dump trucks to haul the aggregate and loaders to load the trucks. Dump trucks can run anywhere from $30,00 for a pre-owned model, to $100,000 for a brand new truck, suggests the industry website Trux. Front-end loaders are comparable in price.

## Process & Product - N-TEX Sand & Gravel
The process to make quality concrete sand starts with our pit. We start with a quality natural raw material in the ground. Some concrete sand producers have to add a crushed rock bi-product, also referred to as "man sand", to mix with their natural sand because their natural sand is too fine to get the coarseness required in the finished product.

## Concrete
The hydration process is exothermic, which means ambient temperature plays a significant role in how long it takes concrete to set. Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix, delay or accelerate the curing time, or otherwise change the finished material.
