## Olivine | Encyclopedia
Olivine is readily altered to the mineral serpentine by the hydration of its crystal structure by hot (400 - 800 ° C) water. This process occurs along mid-ocean ridges and other places where mafic rock is exposed to superheated water. Peridot (pronounced PER-ih-do) is a transparent variety of olivine valued as a gemstone.

## Olivine Weathering in Soil, and Its Effects on Growth and Nutrient 
Mineral carbonation of basic silicate minerals regulates atmospheric CO2 on geological time scales by locking up carbon. Mining and spreading onto the earth's surface of fast-weathering silicates, such as olivine, has been proposed to speed up this natural CO2 sequestration ('enhanced weathering'). While agriculture may offer an existing infrastructure, weathering rate and impacts on soil

## Garden Guides | How Is Peridot Mined?
Peridot can be mined from underground deposits. Explosives can be used to get near the peridot but not beyond initial access because peridot grows in crystal layers. Timing is also a critical factor in mining peridot. For the Pakistani location, you would have to climb 15,000 feet into the Western Himalayas to reach the gems.

To inhibit the dissolution of Mg 2+ during the bioleaching process of high-magnesium nickel sulfide ore, the effect of major bi-oleaching factors on the dissolution of Mg 2+ from olivine and serpentine was investigated and kinetics studies were carried out. The results indicated that the dissolution rate-controlling steps are chemical reaction for olivine and internal diffusion for serpentine.

## Carbon dioxide storage in olivine basalts: Effect of ball milling process
The goal of this study is to propose a cost-effective method for the optimization of the ex situ carbonation of basaltic rocks. The ball milling process was applied to a sample of olivine basalt from the Troodos ophiolite complex (Cyprus) for the first time, in order to fabricate novel nanomaterials for CO 2 storage. The purpose was to accelerate the kinetics of rock-fluid reactions during

## Olivine - Rock-Forming Minerals - Sandatlas
Hence, olivine has a high crystallization temperature and is therefore one of the first minerals to start crystallizing from a cooling magma. It takes silica out of magma relatively conservatively, as already mentioned.

In Figure 1 the product system analyzed in this study is shown. It incorporates the mining of the olivine. We have assumed a dolomite mine as a proxy for the environmental impacts of olivine mining. The environmental interventions associated with mining are derived from (Ecoinvent Centre accessed 2007). Scatter/diffuse/spread Grinding/crushing

## Olivine: A rock-forming mineral. Used as the gemstone peridot. - Geology
During the slow cooling of a magma, crystals of olivine may form and then settle to the bottom of the magma chamber because of their relatively high density. This concentrated accumulation of olivine can result in the formation of olivine-rich rocks such as dunite in the lower parts of a magma chamber.
