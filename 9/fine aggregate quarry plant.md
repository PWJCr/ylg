## Fine Aggregate: Definition, Size, Density and Properties - DecorChamp
Aggregate is the granular material used to produce concrete or mortar and when the particles of the granular material are so fine that they pass through a 4.75mm sieve, it is called fine aggregate. It is widely used in the construction industry to increase the volume of concrete, thus it is a cost saving material and you should know everything

Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.
