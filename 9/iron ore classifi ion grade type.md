## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite_SMM - Shanghai Metals Market
Ore is most often found in the form of hematite and magnetite, though goethite, limonite and siderite types are also common. Approximately 98 percent of the iron ore produced in the world is used to make steel. Hematite Hematite ore has the chemical formula Fe2O3 and has a very high iron content of 70 percent.

The grade of the iron ore largely depends on the material type (hereafter referred to as ore type), which provides certain useful information for grade control and grade monitoring. However, in order to establish the ore quality during mining operations, an experienced geologist and a sophisticated analyser are required at the mining site.
