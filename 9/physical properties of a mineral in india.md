Hardness. The hardness of minerals is often a characteristic property, and as such is useful in identification. Hardness is defined as the resistance of a mineral to scratching, thus soft minerals such as talc powder easily. In 1824 an Austrian mineralogist F. Mohs selected 10 minerals that displayed increasing hardness.

## Physical properties of soil
The physical properties of soil, in order of decreasing importance for ecosystem services such as crop production, are texture, structure, bulk density, porosity, consistency, temperature, colour and resistivity. Soil texture is determined by the relative proportion of the three kinds of soil mineral particles, called soil separates: sand, silt, and clay.

A mineral's streak is the color of its powder when the mineral is rubbed on a square of porcelain called a streak plate. Streak is one of the best physical properties for the recognition of metallic minerals because metallic minerals all have a very dark-colored streak that is nearly always consistent for a given metallic mineral.
