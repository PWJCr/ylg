In August 2021, Indonesia suspended coal exports from 34 coal mining companies it said failed to meet domestic market obligations between January and July last year. Indonesia is among the top 10 global green house gas emitters and coal makes up around 60% of its energy sources. We live in a world where facts and fiction get blurred.
