## Water for Coal | Union of Concerned Scientists
Water is used to extract, wash, and sometimes transport the coal; to cool the steam used to make electricity in the power plant; and to control pollution from the plant. The acts of mining and burning coal, as well as dealing with the waste, also can have major effects on water quality.

## Quality Assurance for the Coal Industry - Cotecna
Apr 27, 2021Coal is an essential commodity used as fuel for energy and raw material in the production of metals and chemicals. As of 2016, coal provided about a quarter of the world's primary energy and two-fifths of electricity usage. Proper quality control is imperative for producers to minimize costs, improve operations, and reduce emissions.

## Coal Blending Strategies Reduce Costs and Improve Quality
Coal mining yields products of variable composition and quality. Variations in coal quality necessitates accurately sorting, separating, and blending the coal to meet customer specifications. On-line coal analyzers have been in use for more than two decades to help achieve proper sorting, and subsequent blending, of coal.

First, the coal quality requirements for a planning period must be met, subject to some physical and geological constraints, policies and mining methods. Secondly, the quantity re- quirements must ensure sufficient coal produc- tion. This model, in general, is based on predicted information about the in-situ quality of the coal deposit.

## Improving the Competitiveness of Coal | Department of Energy
The coal mining industry can increase the competitiveness of coal by removing minerals from it to produce a higher-grade product. A cleaner, more energy dense fuel will lead to improved boiler operation by reducing ash formation in the boiler which in turn minimizes fouling, ash handling, and disposal. In addition, significant cost savings are
