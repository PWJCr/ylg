High-phosphorus oolitic iron ore, treated by suspended flash magnetic roasting, contained 42.73 iron (mainly present as magnetite) and 0.93 phosphorus (present as collophane). Low-intensity magnetic separation (LIMS) was combined with reverse flotation to increase the iron and reduce the phosphorus contents of the roasted product.
