done in either electric furnace or rotary reduction kiln. Titanium oxide is a stable oxide, and therefore, carbon smelting is done to yield pig iron and titanium oxide from the ilmenite. Today, there are several companies using thermal reduction to produce titanium oxide. During the thermal reduction of ilmenite, all of the Fe 2O 3 and FeO are.
