## VXPmill for fine & ultra fine grinding | FLSmidth
There is a large gap between the tip speed and power intensity of the low-speed vertical mills and the high-speed horizontal mills. The VXP mill bridges the gap between high-speed and low-speed mills. The VXPmills are designed for fine and ultra fine grinding applications. In practice, the mill performs best when the feed has a normal distribution.

## Comparison Grinding Principle of Ball Mill and Vertical Roller Mill
Ball mills and vertical roller mill use different forces to achieve the necessary size reduction of clinker and gypsum plus other materials.. In ball milling, the size of the material is progressively reduced through the impact and attrition forces on the feed material as the rotation of the mill causes the tumbling action of the grinding media.

The only real difference comes in the cutting heads. Instead of a fixed spindle rotating vertically, horizontal mills (like our Summit® #3 Series Universal Horizontal Milling Machine) have a single horizontal arbor. This arbor (a sort of rod or shaft) is equipped with grinding wheels which frequently resemble thick saw blades.
