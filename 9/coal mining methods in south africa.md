## Open Cast Mining in South Africa - SG
Open cast mining is a useful method of extracting ore near the surface. It allows teams to fast track box cut excavations on gold, platinum and uranium mines as it saves the need for the usual methodological approach. In this article we'll look at what we mean by open cast mining, along with its uses in South Africa. What is Open Cast Mining? Open cast mining, also known as open-pit mining

## Coal Mining -The 2 Most Basic Techniques Of Extraction
They are two most basic methods that miners use to quarry coal. While surface mining is used for coal that can be found anywhere from the surface to 200 feet below, underground mining is used for coal that is located lower. In surface mining, the top layer is removed which may include plants, soil rocks. This exposes the coal below the top layer.

Coal production in South Africa is concentrated in large mines, with 8 mines accounting for 61 % of the output. About 46.5 % of the country's coal mining is underground and 53.5 % is produced from open-cast mining methods (SA Yearbook 2007 / 08).
