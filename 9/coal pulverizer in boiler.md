## [Solved] A pulverized coal boiler generates approximately _______ fly
In the coal thermal power plant, the steam is produced at high pressure in the steam boiler due to the burning of fuel (pulverized coal) in boiler furnaces. The pulverized coal boiler produces approximately 80% fly ash and 20% bottom ash. Additional Information Coal ash: A collection of residuals produced during the combustion of coal.

A wide range of biomass mixed co-firing rates can be realized by applying coal/biomass dual system (coal pulverizer/burner) to coal-fired power generation technologies. Biomass co-firing rates can be adjusted without major changes of equipment. In addition, it is possible to have 100% biomass firing in a boiler by adding a small amount of coal ash.

Pulverized coal is the most efficient way of using coal in a steam generator. The coal is ground so that about 70 % will pass through 200 mesh (0.075 mm) and 99 % will pass through 50 mesh (0.300 mm). A pulverized coal boiler can be easily adapted for other fuels like gas if required later without much difficulty.

Acceptable standards for best low-NO x burner performance are coal fineness of 75% passing a 200-mesh sieve and less than 0.1% remaining on a 50-mesh sieve. Fuel balance should be within the range

The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 650 °F (340 °C) from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action, the hot air dries it and blows out the usable fine coal powder to be used as fuel. The powdered coal from the pulverizer is directly blown to a burner in the boiler.
