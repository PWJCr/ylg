## Roll Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Roll crushers apply shear or compression to the material that is going to be reduced in size. This action occurs between two hardened surfaces. The speed and diameter of the rolls, the desired capacity, and the feed and product size distribution are all critical in the proper sizing and operation of this type of machine.

The structure of the single roll crusher is shown in Figure 3. The crushing mechanism consists of a rotating roll 1 and a jaw plate 4. The jaws are mounted on a bolt with a tooth bushing 2 on the core of the roll, with the tip of the tooth sticking forward like a hawk's beak, which can be removed and replaced when the bushing wears out.

As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
