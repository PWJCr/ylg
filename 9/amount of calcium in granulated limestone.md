Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually calcite, sometimes aragonite. It may also contain considerable amounts of magnesium carbonate (dolomite, (CaMg)(CO3)2). Most limestones have a granular texture, but limestone can also be massive, crystalline or clastic.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

## Common Uses For Limestone | What Can Lime Be Used For?
Applying pulverized limestone increases bacterial activity in the soil, which creates a more favorable soil structure. It helps with the disintegration of organic matter and compost. This in turn makes the soil more porous, which increases the air's ability to circulate through the soil and hold and absorb water.
