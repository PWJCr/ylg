## Refining of Nickel Copper Cobalt Mattes by Pressure Leaching and 
Basic to any consideration of matte refining are the contents of iron and sulphur. In general, matte will have much loss iron and much less sulphur than concentrate, for an equivalent weight of nickel, copper or cobalt. The process of smelting to produce matte rejects a large proportion of the iron, and the sulphur associated with it.

About 100 pounds of matte are premelted to seal the copper well. Since the matte must be at least 1,250° C before insertion of the water-cooled probe, it is heated initially to 1,400° C before being transferred manually in pots to the COS furnace. An arc is struck on the matte surface immediately after charging to prevent freezing in the well.

matte, crude mixture of molten sulfides formed as an intermediate product of the smelting of sulfide ores of metals, especially copper, nickel, and lead. Instead of being smelted directly to metal, copper ores are usually smelted to matte, preferably containing 40-45 percent copper along with iron and sulfur, which is then treated by converting in a Bessemer-type converter.

## Copper- and Nickel-Recovery
enviolet has developed a stand-alone technology that addresses not only the issue of meeting low discharge limits, but also recovers copper and nickel with a metal purity of 99.99% and 99.5% respectively. The recovered metal requires no additional purification steps and can be sold on the open market to yield 95% of the LME value.
