## Iron ore tailings dry stacking in Pau Branco mine, Brazil
The mining industry has seen several significant dam failures in recent years. Dam failures are associated with errors in design, implementation, operation, and monitoring (Azam, 2014, ).Dewatered stockpiling (dry stacking) is a safer alternative to tailings dams (Rico et al., 2008, ) for tailings disposal; however, this method has not yet been used in iron ore mines in Brazil, where

## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

The method does not use water to process iron ore, instead it transforms mining tailings - with low iron content and no commercial value - into high iron content and low contaminants, making it economically viable. As iron ore must be composed of grades of at least 58 per cent, mining companies stack the lower grade material on tailings dumps.
