Cost to Dig a Basement Under an Existing House. The average cost of underpinning and benching for a basement is calculated by linear foot. Thus, if you have a basement that is 40×20, then you have a total of 120 linear feet. Underpinning costs, on average, around $350 per linear foot.Benching costs less, around $250 per linear foot. The wide variability creates a potential for backfill failure.
