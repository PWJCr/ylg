## Rare Earth Mineral Production comes to Louisiana - Audacy
Rare Earth Mineral Production comes to Louisiana. Rare earth minerals, used in everything from spaceships to missiles, car phones and electronics have for some time been dominated by China. The communist power entered the rare earth minerals market in the mid 80's and has worked since then to corner the market.

## Rare-earth mining - AccessScience from McGraw-Hill Education
The REEs were first commercialized during the 1880s, when rare-earth oxide mixtures were used to make incandescent mantles for gas lights. The REEs were extracted from monazite mined from coastal heavy-mineral placer deposits in Brazil and India. Similar mixtures found applications in steel making.

## Mining Rare Earth Elements, the Environment, Tech, and the  - ETEKLY
The process of mining REEs is ecologically devastating. Processing one ton of rare earth metals releases 2,000 tons of radioactive materials, carcinogens, toxic compounds, acids, and other pollutants into the environment. Since thorium and uranium often occur alongside REEs in nature, tailings from mines tend to be radioactive.

Introduction to Rare earth elements. The global demand for rare earth elements is growing. Australia is the 4 th largest producer of rare earths in the world, and it holds 3.4% of the worlds rare earth resources. As critical minerals, rare earths elements processing is a new industry, which makes rare earth projects riskier compared to lithium projects which have a well-documented history.
