## An Overview of Recycled Concrete Aggregate | ETM Recycling
There are several advantages of using recycled concrete aggregate, these include: It's a cheaper alternative to quarried stone. It's a very durable material and particularly suitable for wet or soft ground. It uses less energy in production than traditional concrete. It does not require mining and so preserves natural environments.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
