## Gold Mining -metal detecting, panning, cradling, dredging techniques
Gold is mined by 4 different methods : Placer mining, hard rock mining, byproduct mining and by processing gold ore. Each of these categories has its own unique methods of extracting the gold from the surrounding materials. In placer mining, the gold is retrieved by metal detecting, panning, cradling, sluicing and dredging.

In other words, 1 ton of ore is only .0005% gold. So really, gold mining is much more complex than digging up nuggets and melting them down. Gold ore must be carefully refined to get every molecule of the precious metal. The process for most mines involves tons of heavy machinery, water, electricity, chemicals, crucibles, and more.

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

## What Is The Process Of Mining Gold? | Eriered Cross
The processing of gold ores has traditionally made use of conventional crushing and grinding circuits. This process removes up to 93 percent of the gold and 70 percent of the silver from the ore. The ore containing gold once mined from the earth is processed by separating gold minerals from the crude matter holding the ore together.

## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
This process takes the smelted gold and using a number of methods removes the often difficult to remove metallic elements from the gold thus improving its final purity. The purest gold can be refined is about 99.999% and can only be achieved by use of the Wohlwill process. Next: Silver Ore - The Mining Process that Transforms Ore into Bullion
