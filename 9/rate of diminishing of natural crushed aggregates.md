## rate of diminishing of natural crushed aggregates
Supplies of natural mineral aggregates are diminishing as their usage increases. Disposal problems exist because of steadily increasing accumulation of solid wastes. In light of these two situations an investigation was made to evaluate the use of crushed waste concrete as concrete aggregate.

3. Density. The density of crushed concrete aggregate is smaller than natural aggregate density. 4. Water Absorption. Water absorption of recycled aggregate is greater than of natural aggregate. It is one of the most significant properties that distinguish recycled aggregate from raw aggregates.

The influence of recycled fine aggregates, which had been reclaimed from field-demolished concretes, on the resistance of mortar specimens to magnesium sulfate attack was investigated. Mortar specimens were prepared with recycled fine aggregates at different replacement levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of natural fine aggregate by mass).
