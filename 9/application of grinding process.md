The grinding machine provides high accuracy and fine surface finish with minimum tolerances. The machining process is done by the abrasive action of the grinding wheel; the abrasives are embedded over the periphery of the rotating wheel. In Grinding machine grinding wheel is work as a cutting tool and responsible for all machining processes.

## In Grinding, Coolant Application Matters - SME
I use a flow rate based upon the grinding power created during the process, because the more aggressive a cycle is, the more coolant is applied. With conventional abrasive wheels, a flow rate of 2 gpm/hp is effective. For superabrasive wheels, a flow rate close to 1 gpm/hp (3.8 L/min/hp) works well.

## Centerless Grinding Introduction, Advantages, And Application
Oct 8, 2020Centerless grinding is the process of removing material from the outer diameter of a workpiece using a grinding wheel. The workpiece is located on its outer diameter and supported by a working blade located between the adjusting wheel and the grinding wheel. The adjustment wheel drives the machined parts, and the grinding wheel removes material.
