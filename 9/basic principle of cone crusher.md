## What is a Pulley System? Types, Applications, and Working of Pulley 
Working Principle of a Pulley System. A pulley works on the principle of energy conservation. The number of pulleys used in the system dictates the force required to lift that. As per the conservation of energy rule, the work done on either side of the ring should be equal. Mathematically, it can be written as F 1 d 1 = F 2 d 2. The pulley ring

Sometimes only cone crushers can cope with the tasks. Why so, you will learn a little later. The CSD has a cone size of millimeters andcan handle pieces of ore from 60 to 300 mm, and at the output give a fraction of 12-60 mm. The productivity of such units is not less than 12 and not more than 580 m 3 /hour.

The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
