## Windmill
Wind-powered machines may have been known earlier, but there is no clear evidence of windmills prior to the 9th century. Hero of Alexandria (Heron) in first-century Roman Egypt described what appears to be a wind-driven wheel to power a machine. His description of a wind-powered organ is not a practical windmill, but was either an early wind-powered toy, or a design concept for a wind-powered

Development History Of Grinding Machine. In the 1830s, in order to adapt to the processing of hardened parts such as clocks, bicycles, sewing machines and firearms, Britain, Germany and the United States respectively developed grinding machines using natural abrasive wheels. These grinders are ready-made machine tools such as lathes, planers

## How grinding wheel is made - material, history, used, parts, components 
Throughout the grinding wheel's history, the bond that holds the abrasive grains together has proven as important as the grains themselves. The success of grinding wheels began in the early 1840s, when bonds containing rubber or clay were introduced, and by the 1870s a bond with a vitrified or glass-like structure was patented.

A surface Grinding Machine is a machine in which a grinding wheel is used as a cutting tool for removing the material from the surface of the workpiece. It is also called an abrasive machining process where abrasives are placed on the surface and corners of the grinding wheel so as to do the finishing process with much more accuracy.
