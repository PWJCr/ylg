## How To Make Concrete Powder From Scratch | DIY - Modern Design
The basic formula to make concrete is 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts aggregate by volume. Finally add water as needed. The stone should be between a 1/2 inch to an inch with rounded sides. Don't use aggregate that's jagged or too large because it makes the concrete hard to form.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
