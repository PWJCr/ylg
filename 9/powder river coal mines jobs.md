## Wyoming coal mine in Powder River Basin will stop operations
The Coal Creek mine produced about 2 million tons of its lower heat value coal last year, 73% less than in 2018. The mines in the Powder River Basin produce about 40% of the nation's coal, but production has declined in part because of a push for natural gas and renewable energy.

Two coal producers announced massive layoffs at their Powder River Basin operations on Thursday, totalling 300 mining jobs, and attributed the cuts to ongoing coal market pressures made worse by the COVID-19-related economic shutdown. Peabody energy cut 170 jobs at its North Antelope Rochelle mine, the largest mine in the U.S. by production.

## Powder River Basin Coal Mines Could Drastically Increase Carbon 
The coal mining expansion in the Powder River Basin is going to have an impact on worldwide carbon dioxide levels. As people across the globe try to work together to bring our carbon dioxide levels down, the 16 billion tons of potential carbon dioxide in the Powder River Basin projects would increase atmospheric levels of carbon.

Progress Rail. For years the Tennessee Railroad track that ran from Oneida in Scott County, Tenn., to Devonia in Anderson County, Tenn., was used to carry coal from mines. Today, the line itself could be picked at for profit. RJ Corman is expected to notify the Surface Transportation Board that it will abandon the 41-mile route.

## The Powder River Basin: A Natural History | WyoHistory
In 1922, a scandal over oil leases around Teapot Dome on the south end of the Powder River Basin led to the jailing of U. S. Secretary of Interior Albert Fall and, briefly, of oilman Harry Sinclair.
