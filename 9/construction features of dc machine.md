## Construction of DC Generator - Each Part Explanation - Electrical Deck
Let us see the construction of the dc generator. A dc generator consists of mainly two parts. They are stationary part (which doesn't rotate with the rotor) and rotating part (which rotates with the rotor). Stationary parts of a dc generator are, Yoke or magnetic frame. Pole cores and pole shoes. Field windings. Brushes and Brush Holders.

## Construction of DC Machines
DC GENERATOR - INTRODUCTION . An electrical generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy, generally using electromagnetic induction.The source of mechanical energy may be a reciprocating or turbine steam engine, water falling through a turbine or waterwheel, an internal combustion engine, a wind turbine, a hand crank, or any other source of mechanical energy.

## What is a DC Machine? Basic structure & Equivalent circuit - Circuit Globe
Basic Structure of Electrical Machines. The rotating electrical or DC machine has mainly two parts; one is Stator, and another one is Rotar. The stator and rotor are separated from each other by an air gap. The stator is the outer frame of the machine and is immovable. The rotor is free to move and is the inner part of the machine.

## Construction of DC Generator - Each Part Explanation - Electrical Deck
Construction of DC Generator - Each Part Explanation. Electricity generated at all the power plants is alternating i.e., ac, in order to generate direct current i.e., dc, a commutator is used to convert the generated ac supply into dc supply. Hence, an electrical generator with a commutator fixed on the shaft is known as a DC Generator.
