## Quarry Site Best Practices - Natural Stone Council
Scrap stone and overburden, materials native to the quarry, should be used to help restore the site. The amount of scrap, however, may be insufficient to completely satisfy the needs. As such, other options exist to reclaim the site. Overburden, rock, or gravel from other sites can be used to landscape the site.

## What is Overburden? - Flyability
Overburden is the rock or soil layer that needs to be removed in order to access the ore being mined. Overburden is also referred to as spoil or waste. Overburdens are removed from surface mining and do not contain toxic components, unlike tailings, which is another type of underground mining waste. Interburden, a related term, refers to the

## quarry removal of overburden
The first step in an operating quarry is to remove the overburden so we can see the rock. Excavators remove the overburden in stages as the quarry grows. The overburden can be used to build berms. The berms are like small hills. They are placed around the quarry to block noise. When planted the berms make the quarry look nice when people drive by.
