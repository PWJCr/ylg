Mine safety training saves lives. In 1978, the year the Mine Safety and Health Admin-istration was established, 242 miners died in mining accidents. In 2012 the number of deaths had dropped to 36. Training the people who work in the mining industry - and retraining annually - helps reduce deaths, injuries and illnesses.

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.
