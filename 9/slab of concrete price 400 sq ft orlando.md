## Reinforced Concrete costs - Structural engineering general discussion 
I use $10-12 a square foot for slabs on grade.similar to jayrod12.just had a project bid at about that number for replacement of a SOG.the $10-$12 is for placement. Demo is extra. Your PT elevated slab price is low. I would use $35 min. per square foot. For conventional elevated slabs, $30/sf is reasonable.

4 ÷ 12 = .33. 100 x .33 = 33 cubic feet. 33 x .037 = 1.22 cubic yards. Essentially you are solving for volume and then converting to cubic yards. For concrete, the formula for volume is as follows: length x width x thickness. To determine how many bags of concrete you will need, divide the total cubic yards needed by the yield.
