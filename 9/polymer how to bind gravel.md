## How to stabilize pea gravel? | Lawn Care Forum
Get some cement, not sand mix or concrete . Take it dry and rake it in with the pea gravel, you dont want too much cement sitting on top . Take a sprinkler and wet it down, it will tighten it up, still be looser stones on top. I was thinking something like this might work. Stiffin it up a bit so it's not so loose.

The paths were brick edged gravel paths, so the gravel was the depth of the brick. I'd used 7mm screening for the gravel. I took on board the advice that cement alone wouldn't bind the screening.

## What is a polymer? What is soil stabilizing? - AggreBind
The word polymer is used for a wide variety of products offered to the road construction industry. Some of these soil stabilizing "polymer" products have the same formula as soap powders. They simply lubricate the soil to assist in achieving maximum density when the treated soil is compacted. They have no binding properties at all.
