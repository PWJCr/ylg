## Can you use magnesium oil on face wrinkles?
Chloride ions (Cl-) and magnesium ions (Mg2+), which make up magnesium chloride, are not lipophilic. They are therefore not able to directly cross biological membranes. In other words, to enter the body, magnesium must pass through transporters specifically dedicated to this role, present on the surface of the latter.
