Impact of Manufactured Sand on Concrete. At the end of the process, manufactured sand obtained improved performance. M sand has reduced area and better particle packing. This makes a stronger bond with available cement paste.  With the use of 100 percent manufactured sand, the strength of concrete can increase by up to 7.5 percent.

"The quality of natural sand varies more than that of sand produced in an industrial process. Consistent quality is a typical feature of crushed sand. Concrete manufacturers benefit from the use of sand that is of a stable quality, because it allows them to use less cement, typically between 5% and 20% less cement.

The manufactured sand has required gradation of fines, physical properties such as shape, smooth surface textures and consistency which makes it the best sand suitable for construction. These physical properties of sand provides greater strength to the concrete by reducing segregation, bleeding, honeycombing, voids and capillary.
