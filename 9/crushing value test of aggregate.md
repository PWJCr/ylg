## Aggregate crushing value Test and Procedure
The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher, the result may be anomalous, and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead.  So Crushing value test is very

## Test on Aggregates, lab tests, fine aggregate test, coarse aggregate 
The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement, aggregates possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred. Why to test Aggregate Crushing Value? The principal mechanical properties required in road stones are:

Sampling for Crushing Test of Aggregate. For the Aggregate crushing value test, an aggregate sample passing through a 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on a 10mm IS sieve is selected and dried to a temperature of 105 ºC to 110 ºC then cooled to room temperature.. To fill the cylindrical measure mold about 6.5 kg of a sample of aggregate is sufficient.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test Method - Project Management 123
Crushing Value Test Procedure. Select clean and dry aggregate passing through 12.5 mm and retained on 10.0 mm sieve. Weight the empty cylindrical measure. Let the weight be 'a' grams. Fill the aggregate in the cylindrical measure in three layers, tamping each layer 25 times with the rounded end of the tamping rod.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Apparatus
AG-760 AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE APPARATUS (PENGUJIAN KEHANCURAN AGREGAT). Pengujian Aggregate Crushing Value Apparatus adalah untuk menentukan sifat kehancuran agregat terhadap beban 400 kN selama 10 menit. Agregat yang hancur kemudian ditimbang dan dibandingkan dengan berat semula sampel.Perbandingan ini merupakan nilai dari Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV).
