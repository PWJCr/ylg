## How to Prepare Aggregate for Crushing - Senya Crushers
Prior to crushing materials, it may be a good idea to wash them properly. Unclean geological materials can introduce an excessive amount of dust and dirt into the machine, leading to unnecessary wear and tear of equipment components. In addition, the washing of aggregate is often an important part of the post-crushing sorting process.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Cement Concrete
Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions, and the strength of the aggregate used in road construction is expressed by numerical index. Aggregates with lower crushing value show a lower

## Crushing in the Aggregate Industry - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
In crushing to produce specification aggregates, on the other hand, not only is it necessary to reduce all the feed to a given top size - say 1″, but also to have the amounts of the fractions in the succeeding sizes - ¾", ½", 3/8″ and so on - fall within certain fairly tight limits. An examination of the table shown here
