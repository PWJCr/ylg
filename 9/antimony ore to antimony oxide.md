Oxidizing Roast Stibnite the Antimony Mineral. In the roasting process the aim may be to leave the oxidized antimony in the ore, or it may be to volatilize as much of the antimony as possible, collect the volatilized oxide as a rich intermediary product and smelt it for antimony, leaving the gangue poor enough to be considered a waste product

## Antimony Recovery from End-of-Life Products and Industrial Process 
Antimony has become an increasingly critical element in recent years, due to a surge in industrial demand and the Chinese domination of primary production. Antimony is produced from stibnite ore (Sb2O3) which is processed into antimony metal and antimony oxide (Sb2O3). The industrial importance of antimony is mainly derived from its use as flame retardant in plastics, coatings, and electronics

Antimony(III) oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Sb 2 O 3.It is the most important commercial compound of antimony.It is found in nature as the minerals valentinite and senarmontite. Like most polymeric oxides, Sb 2 O 3 dissolves in aqueous solutions with hydrolysis.A mixed arsenic-antimony oxide occurs in nature as the very rare mineral stibioclaudetite.

Antimony is a silvery-white metal that is found in the earth's crust. Antimony ores are mined and then mixed with other metals to form antimony alloys or combined with oxygen to form antimony oxide. Little antimony is currently mined in the United States. It is brought into this country from other countries for processing.

## Antimony Ore Beneficiation Washing Plant
There are three kinds of antimony ores according to the beneficiation technology. And they are single antimony sulfide, stibnite and antimony sulfide-oxide mixture. There is some other antimony ore mixed in stibnite ore together with some lead, tungsten, mercury minerals. The main separation way for these three antimony ore is hand selection, gravity separation and floatation separation.

## Where does antimony pentachloride come from?
What is antimony made of? Antimony is not an abundant element but is found in small quantities in over 100 mineral species. It is most often found as antimony(III) sulfide. It is extracted by roasting the antimony(III) sulfide to the oxide, and then reducing with carbon. Antimony can also be found as the native metal.

Antimony isn' t used alone because it breaks easily, but when mixed into alloys, it is used in lead storage batteries, solder, sheet and pipe metal, bearings, castings, and pewter. Antimony oxide is added to textiles and plastics to prevent them from catching fire. It is also used in paints, ceramics, and fireworks, and as enamels for plastics, metal, and glass.

In the metallurgy of antimony, the pure metal is recovered by different reactions, depending on the composition of the ore. For example, iron is used to reduce antimony in sulfide ores:  For the oxide ore reaction, Δ S _{surr} = - frac{778 kJ}{298} = - 2.61 kJ / K = - 2.61 × 10 ³ J / K
