Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.
