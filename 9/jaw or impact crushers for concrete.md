## Impact crushers instead of jaw crushers - RUBBLE MASTER
A concrete manufacturer replaced their jaw crusher with an RM 60 in combination with an RM VS60 prescreen and RM CS2500 post screen. In addition to higher quality, they brought the company enormous cost savings. A concrete manufacturer wanted more performance and better quality in the recycling of its production waste.

## Crushers - Thompson Tractor
Impact Crushers are best used with softer rock, such as limestone and sandstone, and for recycling processed materials like concrete and asphalt. Impact crushers tend to produce more "fines" than Jaw crushers. Jaw Crushers have two opposing ribbed panels, or jaws, with one jaw moving forward and back to crush raw material against the fixed jaw.

## Should I Choose an Impact Rock Crusher or Cone Crusher? - Sepro Aggregates
Cone Crusher Applications. Cone crushers, a type of compression crusher, have less versatility than a horizontal impact crusher, but a great capability to guarantee a finished product size. If set at 2", typically 80% of the final product will meet the 2" target which is not something that can be replicated by jaw crushers or impact crushers.

## Jaw and Impact Crusher Maintenance - RR Equipment
Dec 20, 2021I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.

## Impact Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The three types of crushers most commonly used for crushing CDW materials are the jaw crusher, the impact crusher and the gyratory crusher (Figure 4.4).A jaw crusher consists of two plates, with one oscillating back and forth against the other at a fixed angle (Figure 4.4(a)) and it is the most widely used in primary crushing stages (Behera et al., 2014).

## Tips on Choosing a Concrete Crusher for Demolition Contractors
While jaw crushers use pressure to break up concrete, impact crushers rely on impact (as their name implies). Some impact crushers throw the rock against hard surfaces with such velocity that the rocks naturally break along internal fissures. Other impact crushers use hammers on the outer edge of a spinning rotor to break up materials

## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A crusher is a machine that uses mechanical energy to break blocks of stone, concrete, or other building materials into smaller blocks of a specific grain size. They are particularly used in the mining industry to reduce the size of ore blocks and facilitate their processing. Crushers are designed to receive blocks of a maximum size.

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.
