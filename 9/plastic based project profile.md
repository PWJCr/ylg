Oxo-biodegradable plastic bags are made from petroleum products, just like polyethylene bags. They initially fragment when exposed to air and sunlight. This typically takes three to four months. Later, when placed in a landfill, the fragments are decomposed by bacteria in the soil. It takes from 12 to 18 months for the fragments to be converted
