## Calcination
The process of calcination derives its name from the Latin calcinare (to burn lime) due to its most common application, the decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, in order to create cement.The product of calcination is usually referred to in general as "calcine", regardless of the actual minerals undergoing thermal treatment.

Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock containing 10% of all rocks. Limestone is chiefly containing calcium in various chemical formats including calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and known as Calcite in the geological term. However, common people hardly familiar with professional terminology so it is better to simplify it.

Once crushed and sized, the limestone is fed into kilns where it is calcined, basically cooked, at temperatures as high as 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. During this progression the extreme heat causes the limestone to chemically release carbon dioxide (CO2). The end result is lime. Products Lime can be manufactured in a number of different end products.

The shape of crystals determines the void space between crystals, and hence the density of the limestone. Larger voids allow easy passage for CO2 gases during calcination and it results in a reduction of volume during calcination.
