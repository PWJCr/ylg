## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing - GREAT MINING
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

This region is known as the copper belt and cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper mining. The majority (around 65-85%) of all cobalt mined in the DRC comes from large scale copper mines that are mostly operated by large multinational mining companies. The operations in these mines are strictly controlled by the operators and local governments.
