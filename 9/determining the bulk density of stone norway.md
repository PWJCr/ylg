## Bulk Density - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
To determine the biomass bulk density, we can use standards like the American Society for Testing of Materials (ASTM) E. This process involves pouring the biomass into a standard-size box (305 × 305 × 305 mm) from a height of 610 mm. The box is then dropped from a height of 150 mm three times for settlement and refilling.
