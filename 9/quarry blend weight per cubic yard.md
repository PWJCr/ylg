Jan 20, 2021As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 ÷ 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.

1) Determine riprap density from sourceassume 155 lbs/ft3 in this case. That's about 2.09 tons/cy of 'rock'. 2) Now the part I need someones experience on is how much void to factor in. If voids account for 33% of the total volume then this reduces to 1.5 tons per 'neat' cy. I realize this can vary, but what we have to use something.
