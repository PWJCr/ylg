Jan 20, 2021As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 รท 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.
