## What is Data Aggregation? - Definition from Techopedia
Data aggregation is a type of data and information mining process where data is searched, gathered and presented in a report-based, summarized format to achieve specific business objectives or processes and/or conduct human analysis. Data aggregation may be performed manually or through specialized software.

The aggregate-Oriented database is the NoSQL database which does not support ACID transactions and they sacrifice one of the ACID properties. Aggregate orientation operations are different compared to relational database operations. We can perform OLAP operations on the Aggregate-Oriented database.
