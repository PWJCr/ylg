Different sizes for jaw crushers are available. The size of a Jaw Crusher is measured by the top-opening of the V-shaped chamber. For instance, if a Jaw Crusher measures 50" 44" then 50" is its length from one jaw towards another, and 44" is the width across the two chambers. Different Functions Of Jaw Crusher:

/ THE WORKING PRINCIPLE OF JAW CRUSHERS All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

## How to improve jaw crusher performance and productivity
Apply the proper jaw die profile. There are many kinds of rocks, differing in crushability, abrasiveness, flakiness, etc. Choosing the best combination of fixed and movable jaw dies profiles will help to optimize production when crushing difficult material. A Rock of low crushability requires a closer nip angle to keep the capacity as designed.
