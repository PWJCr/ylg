## Controlled blasting in a limestone mine using electronic detonators: A 
Except for very deep-seated deposits, open cast mining method has been recognized as the safest and most productive mode for mining minerals. Ever growing demand in minerals and coal has compelled the mine operators to increase the size of mine, which has resulted in an increasing trend towards large capacity open cast projects. Explosives and blasting techniques play a significant role in efficient opencast mining operations. There have been constant technological developments
