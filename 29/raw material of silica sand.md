## What Raw Materials Are Used in Glass Making?
There are four main raw materials used to make glass: silica sand, soda ash, dolomite and limestone. In many cases, broken pieces of glass called cullet are also added to these raw materials to help them properly melt when heated. There are a number of different ways to make glass, depending on the desired finished product.
