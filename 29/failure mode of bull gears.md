## Fretting-slipping fatigue failure mode in planetary gear system
A fretting-slipping fatigue failure mode in a planetary gear system is analyzed. • The FEM model is established to prove the existence of slipping in planetary gear gearboxes. • The macro and micro features of this fretting-slipping fatigue failure mode are investigated. • The formations of pits, bumps and built-up edges are revealed.

## Failure Mode Analysis - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A failure mode is the effect by which a failure is observed. For the elements that have been identified, possible failure modes for each given element are listed. For example, the potential failure modes of a solder joint are either open or intermittent change in resistance, which can hamper the solder joint function as an electrical interconnect.

Jan 26, 20212 — GEAR DISTRESS AND FAILURE MODES Distress or failure of gears may be classified into four categories: 1 - surface fatigue (pitting), 2 - wear, 3 - plastic flow 4 - breakage. The appearance of the various distress and failure modes can differ between gears that have through hardened teeth and those that have surface hardened teeth.

Finally, the proportion of the gear bending fatigue fracture failure is 32.8% of the total gear failure. The reason for this phenomenon is that the maximum bending stress of the gear is produced at the root of the gear in the actual working process, and the stress concentration phenomenon is easy to occur at the tooth root position.

Excessive wear and tear. Excessive wear results from moderate damage that is never addressed and causes periodic problems. This wear results in pitting on the surfaces of the gear. Pitting causes vibration within the gearbox, which increases noise and damage to the gears. Eventually, this issue could result in total equipment failure.

Modes Of Gear Teeth Failure - Types Of Gear Defects : 1. Bending failure. Gear tooth behaves like a cantilever beam subjected to repetitive bending stress. The tooth may crack due to repetitive bending stress. To avoid such failure, the module and face width of the gear is adjusted so that the beam strength is greater than the dynamic load.

## FAILURE ANALYSIS GEARS-SHAFTS-BEARINGS-SEALS - Rexnord
2 — GEAR DISTRESS AND FAILURE MODES Distress or failure of gears may be classified into four categories: 1 - surface fatigue (pitting), 2 - wear, 3 - plastic flow 4 - breakage. The appearance of the various distress and failure modes can differ between gears that have through hardened teeth and those that have surface hardened teeth.

## Failure Mode Analysis of Hydraulic Hose Assembly (II)
The hydraulic pipe assembly is an unrepairable product. There are 14 failure modes. There are 8 failure modes. Example 7- Minimum bending radius of hoses. Symptoms: The bend of hydraulic pipe is broken. Hose usually remains flexible. Reason: The minimum bending radius of the hose is not considered. Solutions: Replace hose assembly.
