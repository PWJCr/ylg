## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Why Smartcrushers - SmartCrusher bv - Concrete recycling - c2c - SlimBreker
Crushing equipment is developed to fragment e.g. coal and metal ores. When making use of these types of machines for concrete rubble, the process is identical: large concrete chunks (construction parts, concrete paving stones, etc.) are reduced to small concrete particles (concrete rubble granules).
