## Recycling Of Ferrous Grinding Swarf
The recycling of grinding swarf which is a typical industrial waste discharged from machining facilities for ball andor roller bearings is studied. The grinding swarf is investigated whether it is possible to use as a raw material for commercial products such as a disposable body warmer. Since the major constituent of the disposable body warmer

## What is Swarf? Recycling Your Machining Scrap for Cash
The metal that's removed - filings, fines, shavings and turnings - is debris or waste known collectively as "chips" or "swarf." It usually winds up in a bin that's part of a machinist's workstation, and it's generally recyclable. While it can be recycled for use in other manufacturing processes, swarf often ends up being disposed of in landfills.
