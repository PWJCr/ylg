## Determination of Aggregate Impact Value - Impact Test on Aggregates
Procedure of Aggregate Impact Test. The test sample consists of aggregates sized 10.0 mm 12.5 mm. Aggregates may be dried by heating at ° C for a period of 4 hours and cooled. (i) Sieve the material through 12.5 mm and 10.0mm IS sieves. The aggregates passing through 12.5mm sieve and retained on 10.0mm sieve comprises the test material.

Conclusion From the experiment, we get 6.02% where it still not exceeding JKR's standard, <30%. So we can conclude that the aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The aggregate are mild tough to have the resistance pressure under traffic wheel loads such as car, lorry, motorcycle and etc.
