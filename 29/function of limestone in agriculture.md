## What is the use of limestone in agriculture? - Short-Fact
By spreading agricultural lime onto the paddock or soil, the calcium carbonate content of the limestone is capable of neutralising some of the acid in the soil. This also has the effect of freeing up some of the soil minerals, such as phosphates, and making them available for absorption into the plant.

## Limestone Uses in Agriculture, Industries, Construction and Architecture
Uses of Limestone in agriculture, industries, construction and architecture are to be discussed here. Limestone is a type of a sedimentary rock that is found naturally in the earth's environment. The rock comprises primarily of chemical compound calcium carbonate in the form of calcite which is yet again a type of a mineral.
