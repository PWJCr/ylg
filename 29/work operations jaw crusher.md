## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
While jaw crushers may always be a smart primary crusher stage choice for many operations, it's true that newer cone crushers are increasingly taking their place due to versatility. Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart.

Find the gape size when the capacity of jaw crushers is 5, the width of crusher is 3 and the closed single setting of jaw crusher is 6. This implies that; C JC = Capacity of Jaw Crushers = 5. W = Width of Crusher = 3. CSS = Closed Single Setting of Jaw Crushers = 6. G = CJC x CSS / W. G = 5 x 6 / 3. G = 30 / 3.

Jaw crushers are the most common solution in underground applications when the throughput is below 1000 tonnes per hour, depending somewhat on the scalping solutions. Above 1000 tph, primary gyratory crushers are an option. After the throughput reaches 2000 tph, jaw crushers are very rare, with the exception of a parallel plant layout.

## Jaw crusher - SlideShare
Jaw crushers are reliable, robust machines, offering a 6:1 reduction ratio in most applications, and will accommodate hard, abrasive materials. Or The single-toggle crusher is the simplest and the lightest of the jaw crushers but is suitable only for producing low crushing forces and therefore used for soft rocks.

## Introduction to Rock Crushers
Jaw crushers normally take the mined material and reduce it to a manageable size -say 10 to 4 inches. Cone crushers take the material from a jaw crusher and further reduce the material size. Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio.
