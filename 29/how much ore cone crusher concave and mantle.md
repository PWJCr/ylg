## How Do I Adjust The Cone Crusher - msdeleesclass
The mantle, or cone, is driven by a motor in the machine. The mantle rotates eccentrically, meaning that it isn't moving in a circular manner. As the mantle moves, it swings off-axis slightly and allows the crushing action to occur. The mantle's rotating causes the material between the concave and mantle to be crushed, which causes it to shrink.

A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones.A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.
