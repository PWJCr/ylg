## How To Separate Gold From Other Metals - Realonomics
Separate the gold from unwanted rocks and minerals using one of several methods. You can mix the gold ore with sodium cyanide which will attach itself to the gold and separate other elements such as zinc. Or pan the gold manually in water to separate gold from the gravel and sand in a stream.

## What's the best way to seperate Pyrite from gold?
(NOT THE PAN) From there, just pan out the gold or use whatever method you prefer. The heat drives off the sulpher in the pyrites, and the thermal shock breaks the black sands, releasing more gold. The salt also acts to remove any organics that will discolor the gold. Chuck Irons Well-known member Joined Sep 8, 2007 Messages 1,669 Location

Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of fool's gold.The color has also led to the nicknames brass, brazzle, and Brazil, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal..

Magnetic separation is the process of using magnetic force to remove metallic or ferrous materials from a mixture. Magnetic separation machines consist of a vibratory feeding mechanism, an upper and lower belt and a magnet. The bulk material is fed through the vibrating mechanism onto the lower belt. At this point, the magnet pulls any material.
