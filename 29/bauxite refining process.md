Refining is defined as the process of reducing the impurities of a substance. Metals that are extracted from its ore are usually impure in nature. The extracted impure metal is called crude metal. Refining of metals is the final process . After the extraction process the metal is free from impurities.

Hand-arm vibration syndrome seems to be rare in bauxite mining and alumina refining. Vibrating hand tools are not an important part of the process at bauxite mines, but are common at alumina refineries. Nevertheless, most bauxite mines and alumina refineries are located in tropical climates, so cold-provoked vasospasm is less likely.

## Bayer process
The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer.Bauxite, the most important ore of aluminium, contains only 30-60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3), the rest being a mixture of silica, various iron oxides, and titanium dioxide. The aluminium oxide must be further purified before it can be refined

The most common initial process step to feed an alumina refinery with bauxite is the crushing or sizing of the raw bauxite material that is extracted from the mine. The feed material is crushed or sized so that it is conveyable, as well as correctly dimensioned, for the next step in the process.

## Red mud: Toxic waste of aluminum refining | CBC News
Red mud is a toxic byproduct of the industrial process that refines bauxite, raw aluminum ore, into aluminum oxide, or alumina. (Alumina is put through a separate process, electrolysis, to make

##  Sustainability in Alumina Production From Bauxite - Ensureal
Alumina is mainly produced from bauxite ore through the well-known Bayer process, a hydrometallurgical process invented by Carl Josef Bayer in . 1 A simplified process flowsheet for the process is illustrated in Figure 2. In this process bauxite ore is digested with lime addition by a solution of caustic soda (NaOH).
