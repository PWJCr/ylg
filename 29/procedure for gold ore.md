## Prepare Gold Ore Sample for Laboratory Testing
A 200-gram sample of ore is put into a bottle with 100 cc water, 1 gram NaOH, and 30 to 50 grams mercury. The bottles are placed on rollers and revolved for 1 to 2 hr. The pulp is then panned, and the mercury separated. Pouring the partially cleaned mercury from one clean beaker to another and washing with a strong stream of water will be found

## How to Refine Gold: 2 Major Techniques of Gold Refining Process
Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value. 1 Aqua Regia Refining The principle and equipment for Aqua Regia
