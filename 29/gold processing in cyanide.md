A commerative gold ingot from the first gold pour using our cyanide-free recovery method. The infrastructure for a processing plant that uses cyanidation typically costs $30 million, and is therefore, a barrier to entry for gold miners with smaller deposits that do not fit into the large-scale economies of gold production.

## Sodium Cyanide - Orica
Gold Extraction Process. Sod ium cyanide has been used in the extraction of gold from ore for over a century. Today it is still considered the most efficient extraction method - with sodium cyanide used in the leaching process in most gold mining operations. Orica is one of the largest producers of sodium cyanide for the mining industry.
