In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

His process involved grinding taconite to remove gangues and upgrading the iron ore (i.e., an ore beneficiation process). The resultant high-grade ore is in the form of fine particles, as small as 0.1mm or less, which are not suitable for sintering.

## Iron Processing Technology, Iron Dressing, Iron Ore Dressing - Xinhai
The single gravity separation process is used to deal with the ore with coarser grain size, and the equipment is selected according to the grain size of the ore. Single magnetic separation process generally refers to a single strong magnetic separation process, this process has a strong adaptability to the ore, the concentrate is easy to
