## A Beneficiation Study on a Low Grade Iron Ore by Gravity and Magnetic 
In this paper, a sample from Tange-zagh iron mine was characterized by gravity and magnetic separation methods. The mineralogical studies showed that hematite and goethite are the main iron-bearing minerals with insignificant amounts of FeO. The results indicated that spiral separation yields higher separation efficiency than others. The combination of spiral and multi gravity methods showed

## The Chinese Iron Ore Deposits and Ore Production
4.1. Fine grain iron ore beneficiation. In China, iron ore with hematite grain size of less than 0.045 mm or magnetite grain size of less than 0.03 mm is commonly referred to as fine-grained iron ore . Yuanjiacun Iron deposit and Qidong Iron deposit in Shanxi and Hunan Province, respectively, are the most typical fine grain iron deposits in China.
