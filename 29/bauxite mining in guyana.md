Guyana's mines yield a high quality calcined bauxite, with uses in the refractory, abrasive and chemical markets for high temperature applications. Guyana's reserves of bauxite was known to be 350-million-tons. Major mining sites are at Linden, south of Georgetown, and Kwakwani on the Berbice River [6] [13] In 2016, 1,479,090 tonnes of bauxite

## This blue lake in Guyana was created by bauxite mining. Why is it blue 
The actual mining of the bauxite shouldn't produce anything particularly toxic - mainly clay and dust containing things like silica and bauxite itself, which being a kind of aluminum, is actually pretty non-reactive and non-toxic assuming it's not ingested or breathed in very large quantities. The problems start when the bauxite is refined.

Australia is by far the largest bauxite producer, and it's also home to the Weipa Mine, the biggest bauxite mining operation globally. Guinea, the third-largest producer, is endowed with more than seven billion tonnes of bauxite reserves, more than any other country. Additionally, Guinea is the top exporter of bauxite globally, with 76% of its bauxite exports going to China.

Guyana is the 12 th largest producer of bauxite in the world. The Bonasika bauxite project is a major enterprise in Guyana which is expected to have a 25-year life and is projected to produce and process 232,000 tons of raw bauxite per year. The proven and possible reserves in this massive mining project are estimated to be 9.71Mt.

## Bauxite processing in Jamaica and Guyana: An extension to aluminum 
Building on previous research this study utilizes static input-output analysis to estimate national income and foreign exchange impacts of hypothesized aluminum smelting in Jamaica and Guyana. Aluminum smelting is found to be consistent with very large increases in wages, operating surplus, and foreign exchange earnings.

Guyana's most important mineral resources are the extensive bauxite deposits between the Demerara and Berbice rivers that contribute to making the country one of the world's largest producers of bauxite. There are also significant deposits of manganese at Matthews Ridge in the northwest, about 30 miles (48 km) east of the Venezuelan frontier.

The mining areas are located in the western and central parts of the island. After mining, most of the bauxite is carried to alumina plants where it is refined into alumina. The alumina (or in some cases unrefined bauxite) is carried to export ports by rail. Most of Jamaica's bauxite is refined into alumina and the rest is exported unrefined.

## Guyana's bauxite is the best in the world - Department of Public 
Guyana's bauxite is being hailed as being of the highest quality in the world. The assertion came from President and CEO Bill Rice whose company, First Bauxite LLC, on Thursday launched its Bonasika Bauxite Project. Rice explained that the mining company produces high grade, non-metallurgical (low impurity) bauxite with raw ore alumina

## The Process of Mining Bauxite - Dajcor
Bauxite is a mineral that contains varying amounts of combined water and several impurities of which ferric oxide and silica are usually predominant. It is found in a belt around the equator and is generally extracted by open-cast mining. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation.
