## The dawn and rise of antimony use in the southern Caucasus
Antimony (Sb) was utilised over several millennia as the prime material to opacify or decolour glass and glazes, as well as an accompanying element in copper (Cu) alloys. Metallic antimony objects are rare, and mostly confined to Chalcolithic Central Italy and to the first millennia BCE in the southern Caucasus.

## How antimony is mined?sewing
No marketable antimony has been mined in the United States since 2001, when the Sunshine Silver Mine in Idaho, which produced antimony as a byproduct, closed. What ore does antimony come from? Stibnite (Sb2S3) is the predominant ore mineral of antimony. The most important use of antimony metal is as a hardener in lead for storage batteries.

Some antimony is produced as a by-product of smelting ores of other metals, mainly gold, copper and silver, in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. Important amounts of antimony are yielded as a by-product of copper and silver mining. Numerous stibnite deposits occur in Idaho, Montana and Nevada.

The good news is, through the Stibnite Gold Project we have the opportunity to secure America's supply of antimony. Located in Idaho, the Stibnite Gold Project has one of the largest economic reserves of antimony and could supply approximately 35% of U.S. demand in the first six years of production (USGS 2020, Stibnite Gold Project Feasibility Study).

## The US Military Is Almost Completely Dependent On China For Key Mineral 
Jun 9, 2022The environment of Lengshuijiang has deteriorated to an alarming level due to indiscriminate and illegal mining. Antimony was first discovered in Lengshuijiang about 500 years ago and since then the area has developed into probably the world's biggest mining area of antimony, which is widely used in semiconductor technology.

## Shooting hard cast lead bullets-motorradtransporte
Hard cast bullets can be formulated of numerous alloy mixes (antimony, silver, tin, etc) containing some lead, but the alloys make the bullet much harder than pure lead . Pure lead has a Brinell hardness # of about 4. Most hard cast bullets will have a Brinell hardness # of 11 to 30 and as such are several times harder than lead.
