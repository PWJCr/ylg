Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.
