## Carbonation of Concrete - In-depth Overview - Structural Guide
It is a process of reacting calcium hydroxide in the concrete with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and creates a calcium carbonate and water. Ca (OH) 2 + CO 2 → CaCO 3 + H 2 O. This process starts with the concrete surface and it gradually moves towards the inner of the concrete. Carbonation of concrete is a slow and continuous process.
