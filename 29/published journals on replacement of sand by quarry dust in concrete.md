## Can quarry dust be replaced with sand in concrete?
By the experimental investigation, 40% replacement of sand with Quarry dust shows maximum compressive strength and later on, it will decrease after increasing percentage of Quarry Dust in the sand. Workability of concrete decreases as increasing the percentage of Quarry dust. Quarry dust is Waste. If we use quarry dust as a replacement of sand

Because of increasing the use of natural sand as construction material, we need to focus on the use of alternate materials to protect the nature. In this paper, a literature review is conducted to emphasis the use of quarry dust and foundry sand in concrete as the placement of fine aggregate.

## Strength Characteristics of Quarry Dust in Replacement of Sand
Abstract. The replacement of natural fine aggregate by using quarry dust leads to consumption of generated quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and solves the natural sand scarcity problem. The sand availability as a fine aggregate at low cost which needs the reason to search as a alternative material.

## high performance concrete using quarry dust as fine aggregate - IsrJournals
To over-come the difficulties due to excessive sand mining, quarry dust was used as fine aggregate. Quarry dust is the fine material, produced from gravel crushers. Super plasticizers were used to improve workability of concrete. Cement was replaced with 10% of silica fume. The M60 grade concrete used was designed by using a modified ACI method

## Behaviour of Concrete on Replacement of Sand with Quaries Stone Dust as 
In order to study the strength behaviour and fire resistance of the concrete made with full replacement of sand with Quarry stone dust the tests are conducted. Results so obtained for the tests conducted on cubes and prisms for M25 and M40 grades of concrete with various dosages of super plasticiser at 7days and 28 days were tabulated.

## sand and quarry dust
Quarry rock dust can be an economic alternative to the river sand. Quarry Rock Dust as substitutes for Natural Sand in concrete. Mix design has been developed for M25 and M40 grades using design approach IS for both conventional concrete and quarry dust concrete.
