## Coal-Fired Boiler - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal-fired boilers are mainly operated at either subcritical or supercritical conditions. From a thermo-physics perspective, two phase mixtures of water and steam are replaced by a single supercritical fluid when the boiler pressure increases above the critical pressure of 22.12 MPa and the corresponding saturation temperature of 374 °C (Shen and Cheng, 2004).
