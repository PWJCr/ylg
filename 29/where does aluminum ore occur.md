## aluminum processing - Ores | Britannica
Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form. Its compounds, however, are an important constituent of virtually all common rocks.

## Aluminum facts - NRCan
Aluminum does not exist in a pure state in nature. The production of primary aluminum metal begins with bauxite ore, which is composed of hydrated aluminum oxide (40% to 60%) mixed with silica and iron oxide. It takes approximately 4 to 5 tonnes of bauxite ore to produce 2 tonnes of alumina. In turn, it takes approximately 2 tonnes of alumina

## Aluminum Foil where does it come from and how is it Made
The minimum thickness is around .00017 inches while the maximum thickness is about .00059 inches. Foil is made by literally shaving thin layers off a larger block of aluminum, much like a sculptor whittling away at rock. Therefore, all types and grades of aluminum, including foil, must be extracted from the ore, or bauxite.

It is considered a rock because bauxite is made of multiple minerals, like gibbsite, diaspore and boehmite. Australia produces over 40 percent of the world's aluminum ore. Countries like Brazil, Guniea and Jamaica are also important producers.

The optimum temperature required for these processes is more than 1100 degree centigrade. The following chemical reaction takes place during the heating process: "Al2O3 + 3C + 3Cl2 2AlCl3 (gas) + 3CO + heat1" (Othmer, 1974, p. 2). In order to extract more quantities of aluminium from the ore, temperature might be increased up to 1800 degree

Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper, an excellent conductor of electricity, is used as electrical wire. Copper is also used in construction. It is a common material in pipes and plumbing material.

Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum. The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process. In the Bayer Process, the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite. The aluminum is precipitated out of solution in the form of aluminum hydroxide
