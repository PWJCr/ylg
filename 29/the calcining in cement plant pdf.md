## Cement kiln
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of portland and other types of hydraulic cement, in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year, and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.

## Different Types of Gypsum, Uses and FAQs - The Architects Diary
Gypsum, also called calcium sulphate hydrate, is a mineral found in sedimentary rock. Gypsum is formed by the evaporation and replacement of waters containing sulphates and calcium. Grey or white in colour, this amazing mineral can be crushed into fine dust and heated until most of the moisture is eliminated. This process is called calcination.
