CONSEP ACACIA: THE FINEST IN LEACHING TECHNOLOGY It uses an up flow fluidised reactor for the leaching process, to produce the ideal solid-liquid interaction This allows maximised gold leaching kinetics without mechanical agitation As a result, Consep Acacias have no moving parts bar common pumps and valves (thus requiring no guarding), making them substantially safer than competitor products.

## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining - Earthworks
A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

Leaching. Cyanide leaching is the major hydrometallurgical method for the recovery of gold from ores on a commercial scale. There are many different factors that can affect cyanide leaching, such as the associated minerals in the ore, that can impact the levels of cyanide and oxygen available for the cyanidation process.

Seeds from peaches, black cherries, apricots and apples contain a compound called amygdalin. Your body metabolizes amygdalin as hydrogen cyanide, which can make you very sick and even kill you (in large doses). Hydrogen cyanide is lethal because it impedes blood from carrying oxygen, which is of course a critical function of blood.

## Cyanide Free Gold Leaching Alternative - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
What is cyanide and why do we need cyanide-free gold leaching process? Cyanide (CN -) has been used since 1889 to recover gold from hard rock. As sodium cyanide (NaCN), it reacts with gold, oxygen (O), and water (H 2 O) to form a gold cyanide complex (Na [Au(CN) 2] ) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The chemical reaction dubbed the "Elsner Equation", named after its discoverer, is shown below:

Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years. During the cyanide leach process, a cyanide solution, or lixiviant, is percolated through ore contained in vats, columns or heaps. Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.
