The Indian Government has adopted several measures to boost the domestic supply of coal. After a 6.8% increase in 2021, India's coal production is expected to grow by 6.6% to 864.8 million tonnes (Mt) in 2022. Of the total, 93.9%, or 811.9Mt, is expected to be thermal coal and the remainder metallurgical coal.
