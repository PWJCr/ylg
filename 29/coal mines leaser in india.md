## Ministry of Coal, GOI
COAL MINING IN INDIA: THE PAST. India has a long history of commercial coal mining covering nearly 220 years starting from 1774 by M/s Sumner and Heatly of East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of river Damodar. However, for about a century the growth of Indian coal mining remained sluggish for want of demand but

The Indian Government has adopted several measures to boost the domestic supply of coal. After a 6.8% increase in 2021, India's coal production is expected to grow by 6.6% to 864.8 million tonnes (Mt) in 2022. Of the total, 93.9%, or 811.9Mt, is expected to be thermal coal and the remainder metallurgical coal.
