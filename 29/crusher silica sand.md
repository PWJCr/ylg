## Silica, Crystalline - Overview | Occupational Safety and Health 
Overview. Crystalline silica is a common mineral found in the earth's crust. Materials like sand, stone, concrete, and mortar contain crystalline silica. It is also used to make products such as glass, pottery, ceramics, bricks, and artificial stone. Respirable crystalline silica - very small particles at least 100 times smaller than ordinary

## How can GlassBlast™ be silica-free? - Glass Blast
Free-silica is commonly found in traditional blasting sand and other hard abrasive sandblasting medias. Silica-sand dust in its natural state has an "open" crystalline structure that has the capability of sticking to lung tissues. When this happens, the likelihood of developing a serious respiratory disease called Silicosis increases.
