## Aggregate Crushing Value - CivilArc
The aggregate crushing value provides a subjective measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing in the pressure of the progressively smeared compressive load. When the aggregate crushing value is 30 or greater the outcome can be irregular and in those kind of circumstances the ten percent fines value has to be assessed in its place.

Aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The aggregate crushing value should not exceed 45% for aggregate used for concrete other than for wearing surfaces, and 30 % for concrete for wearing surfaces, such as runways, roads for pavements.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

## Aggregate Crushing Value and 10% Fines Value.pdf - Chapter
Calculate the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV)expressed as a percentage to the first decimal place, of the mass of fines formed to the total mass of the test specimen from the following expression. (ACV) = 100 x M2 / M1 Where, M1 is the mass of the test specimen in grammes. M2 is the mass of the material passing the 2.36mm test sieve in grammes.

## Crushing Value Test of Aggregates - Civil Bull
Jul 18, 2021Aggregate crushing value = = ( Weight of fraction passing through the 2.36 mm sieve) / (Weight of surface dry sample) = (W2 x 100) / (W1-W) Where W is the weight of empty cylinder Result The mean of the two results shall be reported to the nearest whole number as the "aggregate crushing value" of the size of the material tested.
