## Learning Geology: Iron Ore - Blogger
Before the modern upheaval, most iron was acquired from broadly accessible goethite or lowland mineral, for instance amid the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.  Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth

## What is a goethite crystal?idegrillandbar
What is goethite in amethyst? Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide containing ferric iron. It is the main component of rust and bog iron ore. Goethite's hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale, and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3. The mineral forms prismatic needle-like crystals, needle iron ore, but is more typically massive.

Mballam-Cameroon in comparison with synthesized goethite to simultane-ously remove cobalt and nickel ions from aqueous solutions. Chemical analy-sis on the natural iron oxide sample revealed iron as the main element and hematite (58.52%) goethite (19.42%), kaolinite (12.69%) and quartz (7.79%) as the component phases in the iron oxide sample.
