## What is Silica Sand Used For? - YUNZE MINERAL
Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface-mined in open pit operations, but dredging and underground mining are also employed.

Silica is an abundant mineral on the earth crust, and it is in sand, quartz and many other minerals. Some minerals have pure silica but, in some, silica are mixed with other elements. In Silica, the sulfur and oxygen atoms joined by covalent bonds to form a huge crystal structure. Each sulfur atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms (tetrahedrally).

## Quartz
Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica ( silicon dioxide ). The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO 4 silicon-oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO 2. Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth 's continental crust, behind feldspar.
