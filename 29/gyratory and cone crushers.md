## Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences
Difference between jaw crusher and gyratory crusher. Any of you that are at all familiar with the Gyratory crushers and Cone Crushers that the former are used as Primary crushers will probably note many similarities between the types. Each use a cone shaped crushing surface, and the same principal in the eccentric is employed to develop the crushing action required.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.
