Step 4- Digestion process. In the digestion process, the slurry is heated to 270℃ to form a sodium aluminate supersaturated solution or "pregnant liquor". A hot caustic soda (NaOH) solution can dissolve the aluminium-bearing minerals in the bauxite. There are two types of bauxite: gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore.

The final stage of the refining process isCalcination. Here the alumina hydrate is washed to remove any remaining liquor and then dried. Finally, it is heated to about 1000°C to drive off the water of crystallization, leaving the alumina—a dry, pure white, sandy material. And so the third step is precipitation and the last step is calcination!
