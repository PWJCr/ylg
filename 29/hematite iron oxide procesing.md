In the present study, we report on the successful synthesis of hollow iron oxide nanospheres. The hollow Fe3O4 nanospheres were synthesized following a four-step procedure: electrospraying spherical PVP particles, coating these particles with alumina (Al2O3) and hematite (Fe2O3) through atomic layer deposition and, finally, a thermal reduction process to degrade the polymer (PVP) and convert

## Hematite
Hematite (/ ˈ h iː m ə ˌ t aɪ t, ˈ h ɛ m ə-/), also spelled as haematite, is a common iron oxide compound with the formula, Fe 2 O 3 and is widely found in rocks and soils. Hematite crystals belong to the rhombohedral lattice system which is designated the alpha polymorph of Fe 2 O 3.It has the same crystal structure as corundum (Al 2 O 3) and ilmenite (FeTiO 3).With this it forms a

Mar 2, 2022Learn more about the physical properties of hematite and its associated minerals, and what makes hematite special. Hematite has a chemical composition of Fe2O3 (ferric oxide). It's made up of about 70% iron and 30% oxygen. Hematite is formed by sedimentary deposits, where clay minerals can also end up and is rarely found in a pure composition.

## Hematite iron oxide nanoparticles: apoptosis of myoblast cancer cells 
Hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) forms iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) which are thermally stable and have various electrochemical and optochemical applications.Due to their wide applicability, the present work was designed to form the hematite phase of iron oxide (αFe 2 O 3 NPs) NPs prepared via a solution process. Their cytological performance was checked with C2C12 cells.

## USB1 - Process for the production of black iron oxide pigments 
A process for the production of a black iron oxide pigment from Fe 2 O 3 hematite iron oxide which may be an impure oxide produced by the "Ruthner" process or by other means, or which may be a mineral hematite. The process may be used to upgrade poor quality synthetic or natural hematite, or to improve their performance as red pigments, by conversion to black pigment with subsequent

## WOA1 - Process for recovering iron as hematite from  - Google
A process for recovering iron as hematite from a base metal containing material involves performing a leaching step on the base metal containing material at atmospheric pressure in the absence of an oxidant, using a lixiviant to obtain a solid residue and a leachate containing dissolved iron therein. The lixiviant includes an acid and a chloride.
