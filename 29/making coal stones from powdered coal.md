## Efficiency of making coal instead of mining coal in terms of furnace 
3 charcoal = 24 BTU. 3 logs + 2 planks = 14 planks = 21 BTU. So, converting logs into charcoal only provides a 14% increase in the cooking efficiency of the materials that go into the process. This is also the case if you convert the logs with coal: 8 charcoal comes from 8 logs and 1 piece of coal. 8 charcoal = 64 BTU 8 logs + 1 coal = 56 BTU.

For the casting of iron, powdered coal additions or coal substitutes are usually added to greensands to improve surface finish in this way, providing a carbon layer to both the sand grains and the liquid surface. The reactions in the pyrolysis of coal were originally described by Kolorz and Lohborg (1963):. 1. The volatiles are driven out of the coal to form a reducing atmosphere.
