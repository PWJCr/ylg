## Mineral hydration
In chemistry, mineral hydration is an inorganic chemical reaction which adds water to the crystal structure of a mineral, usually creating a new mineral, usually called a hydrate.. In geological terms, the process of mineral hydration is known as retrograde alteration and is a process occurring in retrograde metamorphism.It commonly accompanies metasomatism and is often a feature of wall rock

## Decomposed graniteach-haeusle
Decomposed granite (DG) is a natural byproduct of solid granite rock weathering and eroded in form. It consists of tiny particles with a sand-like texture. It is found in quarries from different regions. DG is relatively cheap and available in various hues and colors such as reds, golds, grays, tans, greens, and sizes (3-eighths of an inch to fine dust).

## Decomposed graniteia-meisterfloristik
Decomposed granite, or DG, is made up of granite aggregates that are 1/4" or smaller. Sometimes DG is so fine that it resembles sand. Decomposed granite is the least expensive way to pave a patio, walkway, or driveway. DG provides a natural, rustic look and is available in subtle hues of gray, tan and brown.

ordinary mixes like M15 and M20. [18] used crushed waste tiles and Granite powder were used as a replacement to the coarse aggregates and fine aggregate. Thebination of waste crushed tiles were replaced coarse aggregates by 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% and Granite powder was replaced fine aggregate by 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% without changing the

## partial replacement of fine aggregate by glass powder in concrete
Experimental Plan In this work, 5%, 10%, 15%,20% and30% of fine aggregate is replaced by glass powder for M20 grade concrete. Cube specimens of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were casted for different proportions with glass powder and compared with the properties of concrete prepared without glass powder (control mix). Compression test was
