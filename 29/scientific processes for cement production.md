Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

Step 7: Curing the Concrete. The final step of pouring concrete is curing. This process begins as soon as the concrete is mixed, but can take several months to fully complete. The goal of curing is to maintain enough moisture for the hydration process to continue, which leads to stronger concrete.

## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The production of cement is either through the wet or dry process with the dry process as the preferred option because of the lower energy intensity. Cement production accounts for about 5% of total anthropogenic emissions (IFC, 2017). Cement-based structures constitute the largest surface area of all man-made structures (Odigure, 2009).

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.
