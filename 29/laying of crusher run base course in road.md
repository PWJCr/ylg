## G1 Crusher Run
For base preparation we undertake the supply and consolidation of G1 crusher run. The laying of premix wearing course to TPA and SABS specifications is undertaken by a self-propelled paving machine. We employ hand laying in smaller less accessible areas, whilst maintaining the same high standards that the machine laying process provides.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
This crushed road, which is essentially crushed stone, then becomes the base for the new road. Due to a lack of reporting, the exact amount of crushed stone recycling is unknown. Much of the crushed stone is also recycled right on the construction site, especially with road construction, and this makes it difficult to measure.

## Crush and Run Instead of Gravel Under Slab - GreenBuildingAdvisor
Replies. The problem is the crush and run - or "crusher run" as I've heard it called - is compact-able - and 57 stone - gravel - naturally is compacted when it's dumped/spread. so you have the chance of settlement under/of the concrete and or cracking of a slab with a compact-able sub-base - unless you are able to fully compact it in lifts

This is a useful top layer for gravel driveways because the limestone sticks together when wet, helping the driveway last longer. Crush and run gravel driveways are affordable and can last for years if they are properly maintained. Rake a crush and run driveway at least once a year to keep it in shape and the gravel in position.

The best aggregate for paver bases is a quarry processed dense grade aggregate. Quarry processing creates a combination of 3/4-inch crushed stone and stone dust. This mixture binds well and increases durability, making it one of the best materials for maximum strength and cohesion. 3. Recycled Concrete Aggregate.

## Sub-base Aggregates
There are variations such as 100mm crusher run and 75mm crusher run, but these are regarded as too chunky for sub-base formation and are used as fill or as capping layers in larger civils works. The same caveats apply as given above for 40mm scalpings: lack of any proper grading; a tendency to higher levels of fines; and the consequent reduced

## Another consideration when backfilling and compacting a
Install Securely. Grace uses gravel directly on soil, although gardeners in rainier regions should use a base layer of landscape cloth to keep the gravel out of the mud. Prepare the soil by leveling and firming it. A 1/2- to 1-inch-thick layer of gravel is plenty. If you can make distinct footprints, it's too deep.  Crusher-run gravel
