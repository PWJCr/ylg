## Ball Mills Or Vertical Roller Mills: Which Is Better For Cement Grinding?
Regarding operations, in a ball mill, the grinding media has a higher rate of wear about the rollers and table in the VRM. In ball mills, it is essential to monitor its performance via axial testing to ascertain that the media grading is right and that there are enough top-size media to grind the mill feed materials.

plant ball mill's grinding efficiency (Fig. 1). The functional performance parameters "mill grinding rate through the size of interest," and "cumulative mill grinding rates" from both plant and small-scale tests are applied to this task. A plant media sizing methodology, and industrial case studies, are provided. Background
