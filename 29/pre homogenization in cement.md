## Limestone and Clay - BinMaster
Limestone rock extracted from the quarry is taken by truck to the nearby cement plant. The rock from the quarry is routed to a grinding plant where it undergoes initial crushing before being reduced to a fine powder. The raw materials (80% limestone and 20% clay) are then stored in the pre-homogenization pile. This mixture is called the raw mix.

## Pre-homogenization and storage of raw materials and fuels - LCDRI
The pre-homogenization technology used in the design of cement plants is to use the scientific stacking and reclaiming technology to realize the initial homogenization of raw materials in the process of depositing and taking raw materials, so that the raw material storage yard has the functions of storage and homogenization.. The basic principle of raw material pre-homogenization is that when

## Raw Material Crushing and Pre-homogenization_Dry Process Cement 
During cement manufacturing process, the majority of raw materials, including limestone, clay, iron ore, coal, etc. will be crushed. Specifically, due to larger granularity and higher hardness, the crushing of limestone that is maximally consumed in cement process plays critical role in the raw material crushing.  Pre-homogenization. Pre
