## Variables in Ball Mill Operation | Paul O. Abbe®
The formula for critical speed is CS = 1/2π √ (g/ (R-r) where g is the gravitational constant, R is the inside diameter of the mill and r is the diameter of one piece of media. This reduced to CS = 265.45/√ (R-r). Dry mills typically operate in the range of 50%-70% of CS and most often between 60%-65% of CS.
