## Beneficiation of titania by sulfuric acid pressure leaching of 
The beneficiation of titania (TiO2) by sulfuric acid (H2SO4) pressure leaching of Panzhihua ilmenite was investigated. The reaction temperature, H2SO4 concentration, and concentration of ferrous ions (Fe2 +) had significant effects on the enrichment of TiO2. With increasing reaction temperatures, the dissolution of iron from ilmenite was enhanced, while the titanium loss was reduced.

The kinetics of the sulfuric acid leaching of altered ilmenite, mechanisms, and process intensification methods were studied. The effect of changing the chemical composition during grinding was determined. The content of ilmenite and pseudorutile decreased from 5.3% to 3.1% and from 90.2% to 63.1%, respectively. Rutile increased from 4.5% to 28.7%, while a pseudobrookite new phase appeared in

In some operations the contrary is true. In heap leaching operations excessive fines can reduce leach solution percolation rates and thus can impact the final recoveries (Scott et al. 1998). Iron ore and some quarry products are sold on the basis of size and shape and are particularly prone to a reduction in value due to excess fines.

## acid leaching beneficiation
The beneficiation of titania (TiO 2) by sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) pressure leaching of Panzhihua ilmenite was investigated.The reaction temperature, H 2 SO 4 concentration, and concentration of ferrous ions (Fe 2 +) had significant effects on the enrichment of TiO 2.With increasing reaction temperatures, the dissolution of iron from ilmenite was
