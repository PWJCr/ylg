Today, a continuous casting and rolling process produces virtually all copper rod. Benefits of continuous casting include less microsegregation of impurities, reduction of copper oxide particles on the surface, fewer steel inclusions resulting from contact with mill rolls, almost total elimination of welds, and lower overall processing costs.

A clean and high-purity polycrystalline silicon mass having a small content of chromium, iron, nickel, copper, and cobalt in total, which are heavy metal impurities that reduce the quality of single-crystal silicon, can be obtained from a silicon rod by before crushing a polycrystalline silicon rod, removing at least 70 mm of a polycrystalline silicon portion from the electrode side end of the

Since the typical process for growth of CuSCN involves materials with many hydrogen-related species, it can be expected that hydrogen impurities are present (to a certain level) in CuSCN samples. In fact, the possibility of having hydrogen impurities attached at the CN moieties has already been suggested by experiments [ 7 ].

##  New Generation Furnace Technology for Copper Rod Production
Upwards cast copper rod is basically oxygen-free,  impurities in the copper, it is necessary to use high quality Grade A cathode copper  the melt surface is completely covered by carbon flake. In Fig. 5 a complete production line with 32 strands is shown as an example. This line

## Aluminum particle production on alumina rod surface by continuous-wave 
The temperatures of the gas and rod surface were assumed to be 2300 K: the presumed maximum temperature at the impurity precipitation from the alumina rod surface. The aluminum partial pressure above the alumina rod surface was calculated as P Al = 0.190 atm from the chemical composition at ambient pressure of 1.0 atm and a laser power of 2.0

## The effect of iron and copper impurities on the wettability of 
The effect of impurities or dopants on surface energies is small but significant. The surface energy increases with increasing surface iron concentration while the opposite effect is reported for increasing copper concentration.  In agreement with the literature, the surface containing copper (either naturally or by activation) is more

## Behaviour of anode impurities in copper electrorefining: Effect of 
The anode passivation occurs depending on the concentration of oxygen and sulfur in the anode. In the case of anode copper with low oxygen content, the fine Cu1.96 S particles in the matrix remained on the surface, thus forming the compact layer of anode slime and caused the anode to passivate sensitively.
