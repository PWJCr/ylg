Stomp the broken bottle five to 10 times with a brick. You don't need to drop it from a few feet in the air, just tap it on the pant leg from a few inches away. The weight of the brick will do most of the work. Cover the whole tied-off section of pant leg evenly. Do this until there are no large chunks of bottle left; the pant leg will lay flat.
