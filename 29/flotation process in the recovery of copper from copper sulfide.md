## Copper Mining Info - Mine Engineer.Com
The sulfide ores are beneficiated in flotation cells, while the oxide ores are generally leached. First the copper ore from a open pit mine is blasted, loaded and transported to the primary crushers. Then the ore is crushed and screened, with the fine sulfide ore (~-0.5 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of copper.

The selective precipitation and flotation of copper, zinc, and arsenic ions from dilute aqueous solutions were investigated. Phase separation was accomplished effectively by the dissolved-air technique for the production of fine gas bubbles, and a short-chain xanthate was applied as the collector for copper ions, dialkyl-dithiocarbamate for zinc, and ferric sulfate for the pentavalent arsenic.

When sodium sulfide is used to sulfide, lime is used as the adjusting agent of PH, and PH 8.5-9.5. Only when sodium sulfide is used can the ideal effect be obtained. When sodium sulfide is used, appropriate amount of ammonium sulfate and 1:1 sodium sulfide are added. It can improve the recovery of copper oxide ore.

## USA - Process for selective flotation of copper-lead-zinc 
In a process for a selective flotation of a copper-lead-zinc sulfide ore the raw ore is ground and slurried with water and the resulting suspension is aerated with air to adjust a certain oxidation-reduction potential and is subsequently successively conditioned with SO 2, Ca(OH) 2, and collecting and frothing agents, whereafter a flotation of Cu is effected.

## Copper-flotation-process | What-is-flotation-in-oxide-copper-extraction 
May 30, 2022Amine flotation method, also known as cationic collector flotation method, is a commonly used flotation method for non-ferrous metal oxide ores (copper, lead, zinc). It is used in malachite, azurite and chalcopyrite, etc. Amine collectors are selective for oxide copper, because amines also have a capturing effect on many gangues.

## Aftertreatment sulfation recovery procedure
The sulfur oxide enriched gas stream is contacted with a solid, sulfation resistant adsorbent bed at relatively low temperatures to extract the sulfur oxides and retain them as sulfur compounds, thus forming a sulfur oxide depleted gas stream.. In 2006, we started focusing on diesel aftertreatment retrofits (DPFs, DOCs, SCRs), troubleshooting, repair, and services to help customers in applying

## A New Technique for Recovering Copper From Complex Copper Oxide Ore by 
Copper oxide ore has a complex composition, and a low recovery rate is often achieved via the traditional sorting method. A new combined process of flotation-high-gradient magnetic separation-leaching is proposed here to recover copper minerals. The test results showed that the flotation process was successful when using sodium sulfide as a vulcanizing agent and butyl xanthate as a
