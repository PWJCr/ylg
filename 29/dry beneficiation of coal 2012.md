##  A Computational Work-Bench for Dry Beneficiation of Coal by Tribo 
Beneficiation of coal is a vitally important process in reducing environmental hazards associated with combustion of run-of-mine coal. To scale down energy consumption and improve on environmental impacts of wet cleaning processes, a promising alternative is dry beneficiation of coal by triboelectrostatic separation.
