At Boddington gold mine in Australia, which operated at low grade and high tonnage, optimum performance was essential and LeachWELLÃ” was used to indicate a final insoluble tail value to be targeted.  This can be a very useful for increasing throughput as a coarsening of the grind from 75m to 106m can allow up to 20% increase in throughput

Optimizing for Throughput. To optimize for throughput, producers and consumers must move as much data as possible within a given amount of time. For high throughput, try maximizing the rate at which the data moves. The data rate should be the fastest possible rate. Some configuration parameters in this page have a range of values.

## The Goal: Optimized Production Technology - OPTi Solutions
Optimized Production Technology (OPT) is a production improvement concept used to reduce bottlenecks, increase throughput, reduce inventories and hence reduce overall manufacturing costs. It is mostly used in manufacturing assembly companies. First introduced by Eliyahu M. Goldratt as Theory of Constraints (TOC) in his book The Goal.

## Optimizing The Gold Mine By Increasing The Throughput
Replacing traditional steel cast mill liners with new lightweight composite liners is another way to increase throughput of mills Major gold and copper operations have already started doing this in mills up to 40 and seen an improvement in the slurry discharge of up to seven percent . optimizing the gold mine by increasing the throughput
