## Pelletization of synthesized magnetite concentrate obtained by 
All over the world, iron ore industries are practising pelletization of beneficiated iron ore either in the form of hematite or magnetite concentrate. Added to this, iron ore pelletization is one of the essential processes for the iron and steelmaking industries and mine owners for sustainable and effective use of their raw materials [22,24

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Single-cell determination of iron content in magnetotactic bacteria 
The general picture of iron cycling in AMB-1 suggests that iron is first transported to the additional iron pool, distinct from magnetite, before its precipitation in magnetosomes (Amor et al, 2018). Our results are in good agreement with this model, as they indicate a delay in magnetite precipitation as iron incorporation in AMB-1 increases.
