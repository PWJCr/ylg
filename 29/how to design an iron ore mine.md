## iron Ore - Daily Metal Price
Iron ores, usually rich in iron oxide, are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined. There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently: magnetite, hematite, pisolitic ironstone, and titanomagnetite deposits. Pure iron metal is silvery white in colour
