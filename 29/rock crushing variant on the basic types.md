Rock crushing plants tend to fall into one of two types: fixed crushing plant and mobile crushing plant. Fixed plant constructed upon permanent foundations tends to be associated with relatively larger reserves providing extended life (ideally 30 years or more for hard rocks; ten years or so for sand and gravel) supplying a variety of markets in terms of aggregate type, tonnage and locations.
