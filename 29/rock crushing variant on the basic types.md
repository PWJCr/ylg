## Grease Lubricating System Used in Different Types of Stone Crusher 
This type of impact crusher can be used in any stage of the crushing process. As per the working principle of Impact / Hammer crushers, they can be classified into two main types. Horizontal shaft impact (HSI) crushers. Vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers. Now we have discussed the basics of different types of crushers.

Rock crushing plants tend to fall into one of two types: fixed crushing plant and mobile crushing plant. Fixed plant constructed upon permanent foundations tends to be associated with relatively larger reserves providing extended life (ideally 30 years or more for hard rocks; ten years or so for sand and gravel) supplying a variety of markets in terms of aggregate type, tonnage and locations.
