##  Alloy selection in wet-process phosphoric acid - Chemycal
In the wet-process, phosphate rock is crushed and reacted with a sulfuric/phosphoric acid mixture to form dilute, impure phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 Acid produced in this manner has a significant amount of impurities originating in the phosphate rock.

## Surface modification of magnesium hydroxide by wet process and effect 
In this work, we employed vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES) to modify MH by wet process. Compared to dry process, wet modification process could afford better dispersion of surface modifier and more uniform surface coating. The existence of Si in VTES could be expected to afford better compatibility of VTES modified MH (VTES-MH) to SR.

## Wet Process Phosphoric Acid Production | Vaisala
The wet process consists of reaction, filtration and concentration steps. The phosphate rock is ground and acidified with sulfuric acid in the reactor vessel. In the reaction, the tricalcium phosphate in the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid and to the insoluble salt calcium sulfate (CaSO 4), also known as gypsum.
