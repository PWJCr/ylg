## Gold extraction
The gold was difficult to extract from such ores. In 1887, John Stewart MacArthur, working in collaboration with brothers Dr Robert and Dr William Forrest for the Tennant Company in Glasgow, Scotland, developed the MacArthur-Forrest Process for the extraction of gold ores. By suspending the crushed ore in a cyanide solution, up to 96 percent

Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.

## Roasting and Refractory Gold Ore - Manhattan Gold & Silver
Gold's resistance to oxidation is a critical point of most refining and extraction methods, and the roasting process is no exception. During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

Gold production has continued since about 1530. Coming from the States, where interest in mining is at an all time low, Chile's rich, old mining culture is like a first date, full of promise.In most gold ores, the final process to extract the tiniest gold particles is the use of cyanide to dissolve the gold.
