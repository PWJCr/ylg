## Rare African plant signals diamonds beneath the soil - Science
In 2013, near an area called Camp Alpha, he discovered a new kimberlite pipe 500 meters long and 50 meters wide. The soil above the pipe has already yielded four diamonds, he says: two in the 20-carat range, and two in the 1-carat range. More importantly, Haggerty noticed a plant that seemed to grow only in the soil above the pipe.

## Are diamonds made from coal?aroni
The following countries produce industrial grade diamonds: Australia, Botswana, Brazil, China, Congo, Russia and South Africa. Geologically speaking, natural diamonds are found in two environments. Most are found in kimberlites, which are pipe-like formations created as a result of volcanic and tectonic activity.

A secondary crusher, known as a roll-crusher, may also be used to reduce the size of the ore even further. Stage 2 - Scrubbing. In this stage, the ore are scrubbed to remove loose excess material and is screened. Material smaller than 1.5mm is discarded because it is too costly to extract diamonds from such a small piece of ore.
