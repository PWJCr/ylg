## Cone crusher basics in 4 minutes — SRP
The Sandvik CH cone crusher can be calibrated to achieve specific results, maximize productivity and minimize wear, but any calculation will be undermined without a solid understanding of what is going in to the crusher. Sampling is a vital part of the crushing process, to ensure that you know the size distribution of the feed.

Cone crushers work on the principle of compression. The crusher squeezes the material until it breaks apart. By opening the crushing gap, the material slips downwards to be compressed again. In the production of concrete and aggregate products, the cone crushers achieve high cubicity and thus meet the required product standards.
