## Crushed Limestone | Driveway Stone & Walkway Stone | Ozinga
What crushed stone size is best for a driveway or parking pad? For driveway stone, the best crushed limestone size depends on the application. 1/2 inch limestone is a good topcoat option for stone driveways. However, if the driveway will be used by heavy machinery, such as construction equipment, 1 1/2 or 3 inch limestone is a better option.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Agricultural Lime: Prices, Uses & Questions - Braen Stone
Aglime is essentially just limestone or dolomite that has been ground, washed and screened for use as a soil treatment. The chemical makeup of the aglime makes it possible for essential minerals like calcium and magnesium to be reintroduced into the ground and for pH levels to be restored to neutral. At the same time, the pulverized limestone

## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium
