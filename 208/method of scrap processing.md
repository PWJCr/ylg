First, separate them by ferrous and nonferrous metals. To help, you can use a magnet and wave it over your scraps. Ferrous metals will stick to the magnet because they have iron. Then separate your metals by type. For instance, you will want to separate your copper, aluminum, steel, and so on into different bins.
