## Grinding Machine: Definition, Types, Parts, Working & Operations (With 
A grinding machine or grinder is an industrial power tool that uses an abrasive wheel for cutting or removing the m aterial. It is a process of metal cutting by using a rotating abrasive whee l from the surface of the workpiece. Generally, the grinding is finishing operation to show the high surface quality, accuracy of the shape and dimension.

## Parts of DC Generator : Working, Types and Advantages | Linquip
A DC generator is often used as a DC generator motor without altering its construction. So, a dc generator motor may usually be called a DC machine. The key parts of DC generators are yoke, poles, pole shoes, armature core, armature winding, commutator, brushes, magnetic field system, commutator, end housings, bearings, and Shafts.

## What is Arc Welding? - Definition and Process Types - TWI
Arc welding is a fusion welding process used to join metals. An electric arc from an AC or DC power supply creates an intense heat of around 6500°F which melts the metal at the join between two work pieces. The arc can be either manually or mechanically guided along the line of the join, while the electrode either simply carries the current or

## Construction of DC Machines - The Engineering Knowledge
Construction of DC Machines. In the structure of DC machine either dc motor or generator, there are 2 main parts first one is the static or the second one is moving. The static part is stator and moving part is rotor. In stator of dc machine, there is a frame that provides protection and support to internal structure from external environment
