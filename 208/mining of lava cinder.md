## Volcano - Definition, Stages & Formation | Facts | Physics - BYJUS
Shield volcanoes; Lava volcanoes; Cinder Cones: These are the simplest type of volcano. They occur when particles and blobs of lava are ejected from a volcanic vent. The lava is blown violently into the air, and the pieces rain down around the vent. Over time, this builds up a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a bowl-shaped crater at the top.

Constructional volcanoes are topographic highs and are built by eruptions that build volcanic edifices. Cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield volcanoes are constructional. Excavational volcanoes have negative relief (below the general land surface). They form from either violent blasts or from collapse over a magma chamber.

## Composition of Cinder Cones - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Sep 20, 2021Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, such as pumice, piled on top of one another. The rock shoots up in the air and doesn't fall far from the vent. The exact composition of a cinder cone depends on the composition of the lava ejected from the volcano. Cinder cones usually have a crater at the summit.

## Aiken Cinder Mine - BackRoadsWest
Aiken Cinder Mine in the Mojave National Preserve. Once a bustling, modern mining operation, the operators of this mine abruptly shut it down in 1990 and walked away - leaving all of their equipment behind.  Its job was breaking down chunks of lava rock into small cinders of about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) in diameter.

Unlike the violently explosive eruptions that create large stratovolcanoes, cinder cones form when low-viscosity lava with lots of gas erupts, often as liquid fountains. Lava may be spewed hundreds of feet through the air. These volcanoes seldom exceed 500 m in height and form steep slopes of up 30 to 40º with a very wide summit crater.

## Lava Butte, OR - Natural Atlas
Lava Butte is a cinder cone in central Oregon, United States, just west of US Highway 97 between the towns of Bend, Oregon, and Sunriver, Oregon. It is part of a system of small cinder cones on the northwest flank of Newberry Volcano, a massive shield volcano which rises to the southeast. The cinder cone is capped by a crater which extends

## Mining Active Volcanoes (Surprisingly, we can and do!)
The extreme environment appears to encourage extreme mining technology, from the more primitive to the most sophisticated. Sulfur mining in Kawah Ijen volcano, Java, Indonesia. image: CC. Sulfur Mines in Active Volcanoes. Sulfur is an obvious mineral to mine from volcanoes, and it has been since pre-history. Pumice was also often collected.

## - Features of the Bandera Crater flow, including AA lava and ice caves
In addition to the cinder cone, discussed on a different page, the Bandera Crater eruption produced aa lava, collapse pits, spines, spatter cones, and lava tubes, one of which contains perennial ice. In contrast to pahoehoe lava, aa has a very loose and rubbly surface.  New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology 801 Leroy Place Socorro, NM

Shield volcanoes have Pahoehoe lava that is fluid and develops a smooth skin or rope like pattern. Shield volcanoes also have a'a or sharp, angular chunks of lava. Composite Volcano description: These volcanoes are tall and symmetrically shaped with steep sides. They are built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinder, and rocks
