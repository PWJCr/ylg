The physical and chemical properties of sinter feed are important factors that determine the productivity and quality of sinter product. In this study the feasibility of treating sinter feed by high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) is investigated for selective cracks generation exploiting weak zones along grain boundaries of poor quality iron ores without generating much fines.

Ball mills are used primary for single stage fine grinding, regrinding, and as the second stage in two stage grinding circuits. According to the need of customers, ball mill can be either wet or dry designs. Ball mills have been designed in standard sizes of the final products between 0.074 mm and 0.4 mm in diameter.
