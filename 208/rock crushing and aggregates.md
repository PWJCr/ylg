Then the rock crusher rides over the windrow crushing rocks to a 2 inch or less diameter depending on the need for the job. One of the benefits of this operation is that the rock crushing adds aggregates and mixing of the subsoils in to a uniform product that can, in most cases, be compacted very easily and meet density requirements.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
