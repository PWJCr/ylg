Cement grinding process is the reduction of clinker produced in rotary kilns to a fine form. The clinker has to be ground with the addition of gypsum to get the finish product, cement. The objective is to increase the specific surface of the cement component with a proper particle size distribution and to provide convenient reactivity of cement

During the cement grinding process, when the clinker is ground to a fine powder with other raw materials, up to 5% gypsum or additional anhydrite is added to control the solidification time of the cement. Many factories use a cement crusher to obtain the scheduled size of clinker and gypsum, which is then fed into a cement ball mill for the

## Ball Mill for Cement Grinding Process
Cement Ball Mill Structure. When Ball Mill is working, raw material enters the mill cylinder through the hollow shaft of the feed. The inside of the cylinder is filled with grinding media of various diameters (steel balls, steel segments, etc.); when the cylinder rotates around the horizontal axis at a certain speed, Under the action of centrifugal force and friction force, the medium and the

## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of
