## How long does the average pit or quarry stay open?
Pits and quarries are, by nature, self-consuming. Once a quarry's stone, sand and gravel have been fully extracted it's no longer necessary to keep it open. Sites can stay open for 35 years or more but many are depleted within 5 years. It all depends on how abundant the resource is and the rate at which the aggregate is extracted.
