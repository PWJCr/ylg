Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

The gape determines the maximum size of material that can be accepted. Maximum size that can be accepted into the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape. Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1. Gyratory crushers can produce size reduction ratios over a somewhat larger range of 3:1 to 10:1.

## How to Calculate and Solve for Capacity of Jaw Crusher | Mineral 
Nov 21, 2021Find the gape size when the capacity of jaw crushers is 5, the width of crusher is 3 and the closed single setting of jaw crusher is 6. This implies that; C JC = Capacity of Jaw Crushers = 5. W = Width of Crusher = 3. CSS = Closed Single Setting of Jaw Crushers = 6. G = CJC x CSS / W. G = 5 x 6 / 3. G = 30 / 3.
