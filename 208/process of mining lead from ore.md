## Mining Lead Ore Process
Lead Mining Concentration process, flotation, filtering. Lead is also found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by- product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a tedious process. First the lead ore is ground into small salt-like particles.

6.1 Process Overview 6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations, though a few surface operations do exist.

## lead ore mining process
Lead and zinc ores often occur together, and there are a large number of countries that mine and process lead ore, making it among the most widespread metals in terms of primary production (Kesler, 1994). Most of lead mining is done by highly mechanized underground methods, although some deposits are mined from open pits.
