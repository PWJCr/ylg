It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.

Generally, igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, trap and gneiss are hard and compact. Sandstone, limestone and some of the metamorphic rocks are porous.

Nov 30, 2020The use of manufactured sand makes sense from various perspectives. First, manufactured sand is more uniform in structure compared with natural sand. It also has an advantage when it comes to concrete production, because manufactured sand is less needed in the concrete mix by a margin of 5 to 20% compared with natural sand to fill the voids
