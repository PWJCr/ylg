The main raw material used to make glass is sand. To make clear glass, a special sand called silica sand is used. This fine white sand is needed because it is very pure and does not contain other unwanted chemicals. It is "washed" to remove as many impurities as possible, as impurities can adversely affect the clarity and color of the glass

## How does sand turn into glass?hcharge
To make glass, you'll need a furnace or kiln, silica sand, sodium carbonate, calcium oxide, a heat-resisting container, metal tongs, and thick gloves and a face mask for safety. Start by mixing your sodium carbonate and calcium oxide into your silica sand so that they make up about 26-30 percent of the glass mixture.

## Does sand make glass?idegrillandbar
In order to make glass, sand must be heated at an extremely high temperature. After this process is completed, the artists will mold and bend the glass to create the functional purpose. This process can vary in range, but generally the industrial side is around 7-10 minutes, while the artistic side can be 1-2 days.
