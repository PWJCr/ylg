## Cement Sand Aggregate Ratio in Concrete Mix | How to calculate?
Apr 15, 2022Calculation of volume of aggregate in 1m^3 of concrete. Volume of aggregate = Ratio of aggregate / (Cement+Sand+Aggregate) x 1.57. = 3 / 5.5 x 1.57. = 0.86 m ^3. Now, assuming 1 cubic meter of aggregate = 1500 kgs (because the bulk density of every type of aggregate is different) Hence, 0.86m^3 of aggregate = 1500 x 0.86 = 1290 kgs.
