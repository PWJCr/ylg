## Construction
Construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects, systems, or organizations, [1] and comes from Latin constructio (from com- "together" and struere "to pile up") and Old French construction. [2] To construct is the verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: how something is built, the nature of its structure.

Sep 27, 2020There are several advantages of using recycled concrete aggregate, these include: It's a cheaper alternative to quarried stone. It's a very durable material and particularly suitable for wet or soft ground. It uses less energy in production than traditional concrete. It does not require mining and so preserves natural environments.

## Recycled asphalt vs gravel-kemna
Unlike crushed stone, gravel is usually sold and used in its natural state. If it is crushed, gravel loses its unique smooth rounded texture and becomes crushed stone. It is important to note that some contractors refer to any stone in certain size ranges as " gravel," even if it is crushed stone.
