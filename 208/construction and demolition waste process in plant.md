##  Construction and Demolition Waste - Cpheeo
construction and demolition waste may reduce the demand-supply gap in both these sectors. While retrievable items such as bricks, wood, metal, titles are recycled, the concrete and masonry waste, accounting for more than 50% of the waste from construction and demolition activities, are not being currently recycled in India.

## Construction and demolition waste recycling - Metso Outotec
Many of the challenges in processing construction and demolition waste are caused by the variable properties of the materials. By nature, the waste generated at demolition sites is bulky and often heavy, which increases transportation costs. Reducing the waste to smaller and uniform grain size makes it easier and faster to handle.
