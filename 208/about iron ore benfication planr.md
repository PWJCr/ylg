## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step
