Ball mill Wikipedia. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind, blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

## use of ball mill for size reduction of powder
Milling is a widely used industrial operation common for cases where size reduction of particles is required (Reid et al., 2008).It can also be known as grinding and involves the size reduction of particles smaller than 10 mm.There is a vast range of mill types available commercially and the choice of mill is based on a variety of factors, such as properties of the material to be milled, .

A ball mill consists of a horizontal revolving cylinder containing a charge of tumbling or cascading balls, pebbles or rods. As a very rough indication, ball/rod charge may occupy 25-50% of the total internal volume of the mill. The length-to-diameter ratio of such a cylinder usually is between 2:1 and 3:1.
