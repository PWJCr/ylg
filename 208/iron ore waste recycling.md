## Recycling iron and steel - Jernkontoret
The iron atoms are indestructible, and by melting scrap metal it is simple to get the atoms to arrange themselves in a new, regular way to form new steel with new properties. Recycling is really nothing new for the steel industry. Ever since the 19th century, indeed, there have been processes for melting scrap metal and making new steel products.

## Direct reduced iron process - tec-science
The reduction of iron oxides takes place according to the following chemical equations: (1) F e 2 O 3 + 3 C O → 2 F e + 3 C O 2 (2) F e 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 → 2 F e + 3 H 2 O. In contrast to the blast furnace process, the direct-reduced iron process operates at temperatures of up to 1000 °C. The iron ores are therefore not melted!

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Oct 28, 2021Lower Energy Consumption. Mining is costly and requires large amounts of energy. It requires various machines for mining and refining raw materials, while recycling has considerably fewer energy costs. Energy is roughly 30% of primary aluminum production costs, while aluminum scrap uses 5% of the energy during production.
