## Chemical compound
A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. A molecule may be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of one chemical element, as with two atoms in the oxygen molecule (O 2); or it may be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, as with water (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; H 2 O).

A good solvent does not dissolve the solid at room temperature, but it dissolves it at the solvent's boiling point.  Consider a crystallization of sulfanilamide in which 10 mL of hot 95% ethyl alcohol is added to 0.10g of impure sulfanilamide. After the solid dissolved, the solution is cooled to room temp and then placed in an ice-water bath.

## Effect of dissolved oxygen in alcoholic beverages and drinking water on 
An increased dissolved oxygen level in alcoholic beverages reportedly accelerates the elimination of alcohol. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of dissolved oxygen in alcohol and the supportive effect of oxygenated water on alcohol pharmacokinetics after the excessive consumption of alcohol, i.e., 540 ml of 19.5% alcohol (v/v).

If you want to leach gold you need an oxidizing environment (add chlorine gas or clorox) until you reach an ORP of 1000mV, at a Ph of about 5, hopefully warm temperature and you will leach gold. Once in solution, separate liquid from solids, reduce the ORP to 100 -500 mV using NaHSO3 and your gold will precipitate.

A hot mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids can dissolve gold, with lower oxides of nitrogen forming. Addition of water caused the gold to precipitate back out in metallic form, but if a solution of permanganate is used instead, the gold remain dissolved. Reynolds, later by Spiller.
