## Beneficiation and flowsheet development of a low grade iron ore: A case 
In the present study a detailed characterization followed by beneficiation of low grade iron ore was studied. The Run of Mine (R.O.M) sample assayed 21.91 % Fe, which is very low grade in nature. The impurities are SiO 2 26.25%, MgO 20.48%, CaO 5.85%, Al2O3 1.86% and loss on ignition (LOI) 12.71%. A Davis Tube test was performed for the assessment of the separability of magnetic ores by low

Mar 22, 2022Beneficiation process. Magnetite is the most important iron ore mineral. Cut-off grade is 20%, and the industrial grade is 25%. There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.
