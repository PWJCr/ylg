## Magnetism
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism.

## Iron Ores (Hematite and Magnetite) - GeeksforGeeks
Nov 9, 2021An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.

mineralogy was studied with a scanning electron microscope and the object was to find out how iron is distributed in the ore. The second step was pre-reduction and magnetic separation of the product. The study showed that Mn/Fe ratio could be raised to about 11-12, which is actually too high, but can be reduced to an appropriate level => 8.
