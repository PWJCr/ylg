## Machine tool
A machine tool is a machine for handling or machining metal or other rigid materials, usually by cutting, boring, grinding, shearing, or other forms of deformations. Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping. All machine tools have some means of constraining the work piece and provide a guided movement of the parts

Grinding Machine. A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool.; These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.

Over time, the bearing can wear out, resulting in a washing machine making grinding noise during agitation. You may also hear your GE washer banging during wash cycle. If you have a front load washer, try rotating the drum by hand. If it spins unevenly or makes grinding or banging sounds, a worn tub bearing is a likely cause.
