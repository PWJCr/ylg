An innovative recycling process is currently being developed that uses supercritical water (a strong oxidant and highly corrosive reactants) to convert carbonaceous materials into gases and dissolve other substances that are insoluble in ordinary water.

## Gold ore and gold blocks can be mined by any pickaxe
Gold is a weak metal, and since a gold pickaxe can mine only coal (and no other ores!), I think gold ore should be able to be mined using any type of pickaxe. Gold blocks certainly, but not gold ore. Gold often is surrounded by electrum when mined, which is much harder. Gold blocks should be mineable by stone and above, not wood.
