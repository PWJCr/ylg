The hammer mill design is very robust and is used in many applications, from grain milling to heavy duty requirements such as rock crushing or waste grinding. Hammer mills are part of the impact mill family, which means that the milling effect is obtained thanks to the speed at which particles are impacted, here, by one or several rotors. 2.
