## How To Improve Clay Soil And Improving Sandy Soil - Smiling Gardener
Improving Clay Soil And Improving Sandy Soil. The answer is the same for both: organic matter. Compost is what I'm generally referring to. Amend soil with 6 inches of good compost. Work it right into the top of clay soil and it will improve infiltration and will probably improve the amount of air and water available to your plants.

## How do you remove sand from clay? - PaleoPlanet
822. Registered User. May 30, 2010 #2. Not an experienced potter, but I've read that you can separate impurities from clay by mixing it all up in a bucket of water, letting the sand/gravel/debris settle out, then pouring off the (clay-saturated) water into another container. Let the second container sit for some time, and the clay will settle out.

## Gravel under soil - remove it? - Houzz
The gravel won't harm your garden, might even help it drain over that clay layer. Mulching with black plastic is not my way to go, as plant mulches are, yes, free, and eventually turn into nutrients for the garden. Since you still have room above the current soil level to the top of the raised bed, mulching over the winter is good.
