The robust paving mould slipforms the concrete pavement while travelling over the previously distributed concrete material. Electrical vibrators emitting high-frequency vibrations ensure optimum compaction of the concrete during the slipforming process. Tie bars and dowel bars are inserted into the freshly paved concrete automatically.

## Is concrete a sustainable building material? - GCPAT
5. Recycling building materials: Concrete is a recyclable building product. When a structure has reached the end of its lifespan, the concrete can be crushed and recycled into aggregate for use in pavements or road bases. This helps reduce the need for aggregate mining in the future and keeps material out of landfills.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Posted on July 18, 2019. Concrete is a mixture of cement, gravel, sand, water and a range of aggregates. With about 10 billion tons of concrete produced every year, it is the most consumed substance in the world, second only to water.. It is also the world's most widely used material for construction - from bridges to large buildings, concrete forms the very foundation of our infrastructure.
