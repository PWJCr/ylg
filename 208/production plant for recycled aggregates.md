The construction and demolition waste aggregates are classified by BS 8500 (2002). The code classifies this into two types as: The concrete aggregate that contains 95% of crushed concrete is called as recycled concrete aggregates. And if the aggregate used in the concrete is 100% crushed, it is called as recycled aggregates.
