## Impact of Artificial Floods on the Quantity and Grain Size of River 
May 10, 2021The quantity and grain size of river-borne sediment are critical to geomorphological evolution and ecosystem health of river deltas.

Sep 25, 2020The only difference in the type of salt we offer is the grain size. However, grain size makes a big difference depending on what you want to do with the salt. For example, you don't want to use coarse salt on popcorn; you want to use powder salt. Similarly, you don't want to use fine salt for seasoning meat; it's better to use kosher.

Grain size is the diameter of singular sediment grains, or the lithified particles in clastic rocks. The term may apply to other granular materials, too. This differs from the size of a crystallite, which refers to the size of a single crystal within a particle or grain. Many crystals can be composed of a single grain.

Apr 15, 2021Natural quartz sand was mixed with GMZ bentonite. This type of sand is primarily composed of SiO 2 (99.45% by mass) and has a specific gravity of 2.65. The average grain size is below 5 mm. In order to prepare bentonite-sand mixtures using sand inclusions of different grain sizes, we sieved quartz sand into five groups: 0.075-0.25 mm, 0.25-0.5 mm, 0.5-1 mm, 1-2 mm, and 2-5 mm.
