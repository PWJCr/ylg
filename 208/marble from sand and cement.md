F.M of Ideal fine aggregate for concrete applications are in range of 2.6 to 2.9. Fine sand (lower F.M Value ) reduces the sand requirement % in the total aggregate proportion. On the other hand, coarser sand will require higher sand % in the total aggregate proportion to give a cohesive concrete mix consuming least cement.

DIY Concrete Garden Steps.We recently added a set of DIY concrete garden steps to our backyard. Which ended up being 4,200 lbs of hand poured Quikrete concrete, and 6 months of battling rain to complete.We recently completed our spring DIY project, of adding some concrete garden steps to our yard. These will allow us to walk from our back.
