Screw feeders are used in thousands of material handling applications and are designed to meter bulk materials at a controlled feed rate. A standard screw conveyor is normally fed by another screw conveyor and the amount of material that is discharged is directly proportional to the amount that is fed into the inlet.. In contrast, the inlet of a screw feeder is always 100 percent or flood

## Flexible Screw Conveyor Design Maximizes Productivity
Flow Rate Flow rate can be increased or decreased based on: 1. Type of auger used 2. The auger's rotation speed 3. Configuration of the feed hopper and tube 4. The material's flowability and overall characteristics 5. Conveyor's angle of incline A general rule of thumb is to set a flexible screw conveyor at no more than a 45-degree angle.

The first step in sizing a screw conveyor is to determine the diameter. The diameter is a function of the rate of the conveyed material, its density, trough fill level, screw pitch and speed of the screw. To ease the calculation, most screw conveyors are full pitch, meaning the distance from flight to flight is the same as the diameter, and are

## Screw pump design calculationit
Traditional rubber screw pumps use an interference method to engage. When the pressure is less than the breakdown pressure of the pump, there is no leakage in the pump.The all-metal screw pump stator and rotor are made of metal, and the stator and rotor adopt a gap-fitting engagement method, so even when the pump is working normally, the leakage is. .
