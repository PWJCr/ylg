## Particle size reduction and enlarger innovations for dry  - BulkInside
Jul 8, 2022Size reduction is also known as comminution or pulverization. Generally, this process is done by two methods, the precipitation, and the mechanical method. The precipitation method is where the substance dissolves in an appropriate solvent and then is finely precipitated by the addition of another solvent.
