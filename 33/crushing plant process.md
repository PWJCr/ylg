Extended experience in most crushing plants show that a minus 19MM (¾") rod mill feed can be and is being produced in three stages of crushing. In the majority of cases, the last crushing stage is closed circuited using anywhere from 10MM (3/8″) square to 14MM (9/16″) slotted openings on the sizing deck.
