CAUTION! Because the tool spins on a mill, hot chips can be thrown much farther than when using a lathe. Safety glasses and proper clothing are a must for all milling operations. Milling on a vertical mill is usually accomplished with end mills. These cutters are designed to cut with both their side and end. (See Figure 12.)

## What is Milling Machine?- Parts, Operation, Diagram
Dec 13, 2020Depending on the specifications of the particular mill, milling machines have a tool head speed of anywhere from 500 to 50,000 RPM. A horizontal milling machine functions similarly to a vertical mill with the exception that it uses a rotating table instead of a gantry and its main cutter is generally three- or four-pointed. The cutting speed

For example, many people start with a vertical milling machine because of the small learning curve and lack of available floor space, but eventually add a horizontal mill as their operations grow. Alternatively, if you choose a horizontal mill for its ability to handle heavier materials, you may phase down to a vertical milling machine if your
