Steelmaking is an energy-intensive process that consumes ca. 19 GJ per tonne of crude steel (considered in the BF-BOF processes) and emits ca. 1.9 tonne of CO2 per tonne of steel. These figures make the steel industry one of the largest contributors of CO2 emissions. Yet, the world production of crude steel is predicted to continue to grow.

## Frontiers | Calcium Carbonate Precipitation for CO2 Storage and 
The transformation of CO2 into a precipitated mineral carbonate through an ex situ mineral carbonation route is considered a promising option for carbon capture and storage (CCS) since (i) the captured CO2 can be stored permanently and (ii) industrial wastes (i.e., coal fly ash, steel and stainless-steel slags, and cement and lime kiln dusts) can be recycled and converted into value-added
