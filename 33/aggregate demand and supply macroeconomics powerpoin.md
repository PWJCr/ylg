## Lecture Notes -- Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply - Econweb
Demand for goods and services is less than production of goods and services, and firms see inventories increasing unexpectedly. They respond by decreasing production and prices. As the price level falls, Aggregate Demand increases and Aggregate Supply decreases. Again, the economy tends towards equilibrium.

What we know about macroeconomics. 3. A Note on AD-AS Curves • Aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves resemble "traditional" demand and supply curves but are very different. • An individual or market supply curve depicts the quantities that are demanded or supplied for a given price level ceteris paribus.

This means that, with the available supply of money, more goods and services can be bought Balance of Trade Effect A fall in the price level in one country relative to other countries makes the goods of that country cheaper compared to other countries.

The relationship between this quantity and the price level is different in the long and short run. So we will develop both a short-run and long-run aggregate supply curve.
