## Testwork: Bond crushing work index
The Bond low-energy impact crushing work index (more informally, the Bond crushing work index) is not as common as the Bond ball mill work index, and it is a notoriously noisy test. The test is a 'per-specimen' test where individual specimens of prepared rock are hand-picked by the test operator and placed into the apparatus. Typically twenty

Jun 16, 2015 Sizing a crusher can be done reliably calculated thanks to the Impact/Crushing Work Index and the testwork research done by Fred Chester Bond and his 1952 paper. According to Bond's Third Theory of Comminution, the work/energy input is proportional to the new crack tip length created during particle breakage and equivalent to the work represented by the product - the feed.

Bond Work Index. In the 1930s through early 1950s, Bond developed a new theory of comminution that introduced an index, called the 'Bond Work Index', which relates power consumption in crushing and grinding to the feed and product size distribution. His theory and index were introduced in a widely cited 1952 journal article. Bond called his theory the "third theory of comminution", counting
