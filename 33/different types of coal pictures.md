Shapes. There are many different shapes of hookah coal, too. The most popular and common shape is the cylindrical shape. It is easy to use and fits well in most hookahs. Another popular shape is the pyramid shape, as it is easy to ignite and has a long burn time. Cube charcoal produces high heat and is easy to light.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
