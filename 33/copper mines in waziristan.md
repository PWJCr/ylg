## Ancient Israeli copper mines belonged to the legendary King Solomon
Centuries ago, the place was a copper production district with thousands of mines and dozens of smelting sites. Until now, researchers thought the place had been explored by the Egyptians. But last February, Dr. Ben-Yosef and his team started excavating a previously untouched site in the valley, the Slaves' Hill.

Although the town has been a hub for artists and other counterculture types since the 1960s, its origins are far more rustic. Before shuttering in 1975, the mines beneath Bisbee's Mule Mountains produced nearly $6.1 billion (a pre-inflation figure!) of metals—the copper ore, in particular, was among the largest amounts extracted anywhere in the world.

Mauritania's mining industry is rising in prominence. As a proportion of governmental income, the sector's contribution has risen from 13 percent in 2006 to 30 percent in 2016, a marked increase made possible by the growing exploitation of bountiful reserves of iron ore, gold, copper, phosphate and even uranium.

The copper mines in the Great Orme date back to c.1800BC. They are the largest Bronze Age mines so far discovered anywhere in the world. They were uncovered during landscaping works in 1987, and since then extensive tunnels and surface workings have been revealed. The mines were abandoned at the advent of the Iron Age.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing - GREAT MINING
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

Some big copper mines have devastated the surrounding countryside due to acid mine drainage. Ducktown in Tennessee (see above) is a famous site still recovering from copper mining and smelting in the 1900s-60s. The Butte copper pit, once the mine closed, became one of the first Superfund sites thanks to a lake that filled the mine pit with a pH of ~2.5 . so acidic it killed birds that landed

Standard Oil Company began to buy up smelters and mines, and in 1899 formed the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company. This conglomerate eventually became the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, which monopolized copper mining for the majority of the 20th century. It was Montana's largest company by the 1920s, and in the entire world it ranked 4th in size.
