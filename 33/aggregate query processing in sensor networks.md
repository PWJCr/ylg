## Processing approximate aggregate queries in wireless sensor networks 
In-network data aggregation has been recently proposed as an effective means to reduce the number of messages exchanged in wireless sensor networks. Nodes of the network form an aggregation tree, in which parent nodes aggregate the values received from their children and propagate the result to their own parents.

## aggregate query processing in wireless sensor network
Previous studies propose in-network aggregate query processing, in which sensor nodes use aggregate operators to reduce the number of messages, thereby conserving energy . When multiple aggregate queries are submitted to wireless sensor networks, it is possible to generate the intermediate results of these queries.

## Order by ascending sql-gruppe
SQL_Query: In this MySQL challenge, your query should return FirstName, LastName, and the Age from your table for all users who are above the age of 25 ordered by ID in ascending order. Your output should look like the following table. Then we have to 1st declare first_name in ascending and 2nd declare last_name in descending.

## Wavelet-Based Least Common Ancestor Algorithm for Aggregate Query 
Jan 3, 2021Wireless sensor network (WSN) is developed as a network of sensors, which engage in sensing and transmitting the data to the sink node. The constraints, such as energy, memory, and bandwidth insist the researchers to develop an efficient method for data transmission in WSN. Accordingly, this paper introduces a data aggregation mechanism based on query processing, Wavelet-based Least Common
