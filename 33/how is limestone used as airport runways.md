7. Runway o A runway is the area where an aircraft lands or takes off. It can be grass, or packed dirt, or a hard surface such as asphalt or concrete. Runways have special markings on them to help a pilot in the air to tell that it is a runway (and not a road) and to help them when they are landing or taking off.

BY PVD757 - Fri Dec 01, 2006 11:05 pm. any type of true salt is prohibited for use anywhere on the airfield as it can corrode aluminum (the skin of most aircraft). Airports use a variety of other products to combat ice build-up and ice formation on airport surfaces: urea is a solid ice metler and often mixed with heated sand.

This means runway numbers are based on the compass with 360 representing north, 90 representing east, 180 representing south, and 270 representing the west. Runways are numbered between 01 and 36. For runway headings, the last number is dropped and each individual number is pronounced.

At most airports, runways are constructed of man-made material, usually asphalt, concrete or a combination of both. The choice of pavement material comes down to local ground conditions, the type of aircraft using the facility and cost. .. These operations are then used to calculate the required thickness of the pavement.
