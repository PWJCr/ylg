The Damara people mainly live in the Erongo Region and have been exposed to the region's mining activities for many years. While traditionally relying on agriculture and cattle, sheep and goat herding, many Damara have started working as small-scale miners mining semi-precious stones such as amethysts and topaz in the Erongo Mountains.

The few remaining land-based operations are near Oranjemund, with several small satellite mines near LÃ¼deritz and alluvial mines along the Orange River. The majority of diamond mining in Namibia is marine mining, along the coast and a few km west into the sea. CDM was granted its first offshore mining license in 1961.
