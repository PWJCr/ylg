When new railroad track beds are created or when existing railroad track beds are being repaired, a train consist comprised of a multitude of hopper-type railroad cars filled with ballast are rolled over the tracks. The ballast from the cars is discharged onto the track bed through a series of openings provided on each railroad car.

Track ballast (usually crushed stone), as it is known, is another important part of railroad infrastructure. Although it may just look like plain ole gravel this stone plays a vital role in acting as a support base for the railroad ties and rails as well as allowing for proper drainage of water away from the rails (which is why the stone is always sloped downward and away from track).

## Track bed
The track bed or trackbed is the groundwork onto which a railway track is laid. Trackbeds of disused railways are sometimes used for recreational paths or new light rail links.. According to Network Rail, the trackbed is the layers of ballast and sub-ballast above a prepared subgrade/formation (see diagram). It is designed primarily to reduce the stress on the subgrade.

Historically, the ballast a railroad used was what was available on line, hence limestone in the south, ganite in the west, cinders or dirt anywhere, etc, as you note. As demands for a better track structure developed, many things changed. Ties got bigger, rail got heavier and the need for a good solid base to build it on got more critical.

## Rail Track Ballast | Tarmac
Ballast is the description for the aggregate beneath the rail track. The track ballast forms the track bed that suports the rail track load and provides water drainage. Rail ballast aggregate is typically 30-50mm aggretate. Hard and tough stone is required for rail ballast. Resists the severe attrition in a railway trackbed environment.

## Track ballast
Track ballast forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between, below, and around the ties. It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties, to facilitate drainage of water, and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. Ballast also holds the track in place as the trains roll over it.
