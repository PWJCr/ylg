## The American History of Gold Mining - American Bullion
The California Gold Rush, which is an important factor in the history of the United States, did not begin until 1848. California history tells us that this phenomenal era of extracting gold nuggets from the earth took place in the Sierra Nevada area. Gold was referred to as the "noble metal" and it comes in two forms, that of pure and impure.

Gold is the most malleable element. A single ounce of gold can be beaten into a 300-square-foot sheet. A sheet of gold can be made thin enough to be transparent. Very thin sheets of gold may appear greenish blue because gold strongly reflects red and yellow. Although gold is a heavy, dense metal, it is generally considered nontoxic.
