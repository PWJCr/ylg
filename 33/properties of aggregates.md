The properties of aggregates depend on the parent rock which can be igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic. Aggregates are evaluated through tests to determine their suitability for various applications. Mineralogy, grain size and texture, and petrographic description of rock samples are also used to evaluate suitability.

The shape and texture of aggregate affects the properties of fresh concrete more than hardened concrete. Concrete is more workable when smooth and rounded aggregate is used instead of rough angular or elongated aggregate. Most natural sands and gravel from riverbeds or seashores are smooth and rounded and are excellent aggregates.

The most important physical characteristics of good aggregates are all interrelated, but can be better understood by defining a few key terms: Toughness: How well the material can absorb energy and resist fracturing when force is applied. Toughness requires a balance of strength and ductility, which allows a material to deform before fracturing.

A smooth surface such as that found on gravels will have a poor bond. Crushed aggregates have a rough texture & give a good mechanical bond with cement.

## Characteristics Of Aggregate - Civil Knowledges
The properties of the aggregate have a significant effect on concrete properties in both the fresh and hardened concrete state. The test sample should be a larger sample taken from all parts of the pile and should retain the same properties as the bulk of the aggregate. The different characteristics of aggregate are as follows
