Once broken into smaller pieces, the charcoal and iron ore (sand) are mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. 4. Charge the furnace. Before adding the iron ore and charcoal mixture, the furnace must be charged. Charging a furnace simply means heating it up to temperatures high enough for smelting to occur.

When the iron ore is extracted from the mine, it must undergo several processing stages. Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

We can extract the iron by reacting the iron oxide with a more reactive element. The more reactive element takes away the oxygen. The raw materials are Haematite (iron ore), Coke (impure C), Limestone (CaCO 3) Make a strong reducing agent. C + O 2 → CO 2. CO 2 + C → 2CO. Reduce the iron 3. Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2.

## Iron Extraction and Purification / Steel | ChemKey
Mild steel is iron containing up to about 0.25% of carbon. The presence of the carbon makes the steel stronger and harder than pure iron. The higher the percentage of carbon, the harder the steel becomes. Mild steel is used for lots of things - nails, wire, car bodies, ship building, girders and bridges amongst others.

## Metallurgy
The extraction of iron from its ore into a workable metal is much more difficult than for copper or tin.  Laser cladding - metallic powder is blown through a movable laser beam (e.g. mounted on a NC 5-axis machine). The resulting melted metal reaches a substrate to form a melt pool. By moving the laser head, it is possible to stack the
