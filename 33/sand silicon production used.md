## Silicon Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Silicon in the form of silicates constitutes more than 25% of the Earth's crust. Silica (SiO 2) as quartz or quartzite is used to produce silicon ferroalloys and silicon metal. Demand for silicon ferroalloys is driven principally by the production of cast iron and steel.

## How are Microchips Made from Sand to Silicon - Neural Beast
Feb 9, 2022Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust but is only ever found as a compound with oxygen. Separate silicon from silica sand for microchips. Complex chemical and physical processes are required to ensure that silicon crystals meet the high production standards that apply to chips to convert silica sand to silicon.

An overabundance of silica is used to prevent formation of silicon carbide. Microsilica is a useful byproduct. A mineral perryite is similar to ferrosilicon, with its composition Fe 5 Si 2. In contact with water, ferrosilicon may slowly produce hydrogen. The reaction, which is accelerated in the presence of base, is used for hydrogen production.
