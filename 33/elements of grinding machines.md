## Used Grinding Machines & Industrial Metal Grinders | CNC & more - Surplex
Grinding machines work without tools: all they need is the corresponding abrasive medium, such as types of paper and textiles with an abrasive surface. Grinding stones are also used and consist of a pressed and fired abrasive medium - mostly quartz sand. The finer the abrasive medium, the less surface that will be removed per grinding cycle.

## New and Used Grinding Machines
Grinding Machines are used to grind surfaces of metal materials. Grinding Machines consist of a work table and a vertical column which is where the abrasive wheel, wheel guard, and wheel head are placed. The abrasive wheel is coated with abrasion or a friction material which allows the metal material to easily be grinded from the work piece.
