## How to Calculate Cement bags per Cubic meter Concrete?
We already discussed the volume formula from Concrete Volume Calculation which is. Required Cement Quantity for 1 m3 = (Cement Part / Total Parts) x 1.55 = 1/ (1+2+4) x 1.55 = 0.221 m3. Unit weight of cement = 1440 kg / m3. Therefore required cement = 1440 x 0.221 m3 = 318.24 Kg or (318.24/50) = 6.37 Bags.
