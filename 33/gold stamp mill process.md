The mill is a two stamp gold mill, which was used to process gold and silver rich ore by stamping it (or breaking it down) to extract the precious materials. Interestingly enough, though the mill originally came from the town of Marietta, it did in fact process Comstock silver and gold.

## Gold and Tailings: The Standard Mill at Bodie, California
At the heart of the Standard mill are the batteries of stamps that pulverized ore in order to expose particles of gold and make them available for recovery during subsequent steps in the process. The stamp mill derived its name from those stamps. It was the deafening stamps that made, by far, the most noise when a stamp mill was in operation.

## Stamp Mill Guide | Learn About This Device
A stamp mill is a mechanical device used to separate gold from rocks and ore. It features a number of sizable steel stamps. These stamps are attached to powerful battering arms, which raise and lower the stamps. When the stamps are lowered they come crashing down with a powerful force, crushing the material beneath them.

The Stamp Mill then and now is state owned, but it was built by W.L. Smith during the summer and winter of 1913. It took a total of two men to work the stamp mill at all times. HOW THE STAMP MILL WORKED: Rocks and ore were sent on a car to the crushers. While the rocks were fed under the stamps and being stamped, water was being mixed in.

The average duty of a miner's inch in a gold stamp-mill is given by P. M. Randall as 12 tons of quartz if the head under which the water is supplied is 4 inches, and 15.88 tons if the head is 7 inches. This gives the proportion of the volume of water to that of ore as 11.1 to 1.

## Stamp mill
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

The head normally weighed between 4 and 8 cwt (about 200 to 400 kg) each, and were usually arranged in sets of four, in timber frames.
