## Refining platinumdematelas.fr
Platinum group metals (PGM) are refined using highly sophisticated chemical methods that are particular to their composition. The use of the right compounds, as well as the chemical reactions that occur, makes it easier to separate PGM from other elements that may be attached. Refining is the process of purifying an impure metal in metallurgy.

## Copper Refining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Solvent extraction has been routinely used for copper refining since its invention in the 1960s, and it is suggested that well over 10% of refined copper production from ores is obtained by solvent extraction, accounting for millions of tonnes of metal. It is even more popular for refining copper from scrap.

As the molten copper cools, it gives off the dissolved of SO 2. The SO 2 gas escaping in the form of bubbles, leaves the surface of the metal with full of cavities which gives the metal a blistered appearnace. This is why the metal thus obtained is by blister copper. 4. Refining of Copper. Copper is refined using electrorefining method.

What is the role of h2so4 in the electrolytic refining of copper? Sulphuric acid is added initially, as a weak solution, to help produce a dilute copper sulfate solution extraction from copper ore.  After the solution has concentrated with more copper sulfate, the concentrated solution undergoes electrolysis, which causes the copper to

## 17.5: Refining of Copper - Chemistry LibreTexts
Jul 20, 20221. Figure 17.5. 1: The electrolytic purification of copper. In such a cell a thin sheet of high-purity Cu serves as the cathode, and the anode is the impure Cu which is to be refined. The electrolyte is a solution of copper (II) sulfate. Some of the impurities are metals such as Fe and Zn which are more easily oxidized than Cu.

## Clean and efficient extraction of copper ions and deposition as metal
The iron extraction in organic solution increased with decreasing A/O ratio from 2:1 to 1:8 as the copper extraction decreased. Conversely, the Cu/Fe ratio in organic solution increased as copper
