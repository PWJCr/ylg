## How much should Air Pressure be in a Well Water Tank?
Jun 15, 2022The rule is simple: the air pressure on your well water tank must be set at 2 PSI below the pressure switch's cut-on point. Water tanks come with different pressure readings such as 20/40, 30/50, and 40/60. The air pressure on your well water tank must be 18 for a 20/40 water tank, 28 for a 30/50 water tank, and 38 for a 40/60 water tank.

## How a Water Pressure Regulator Works - The Spruce
The Spruce / Michela Buttignol. A water pressure regulator (sometimes called a pressure-reducing valve, or PRV) is a specialized plumbing valve that reduces the water pressure coming into the home through the main water line. This valve brings down the pressure to a safe level before the water reaches any plumbing fixtures inside the home.
