Jun 9, 2021How to Cut Granite. Once you've gathered the following tools, you're ready to begin: 1. Set Up Your Workspace. To ensure clean, straight cuts, it's imperative that you work on a stable surface. Place the slab or tile on a sturdy table or workbench and secure it tightly with c-clamps to keep it from shifting.

For example: to calculate how fast a 900mm diameter diamond blade has to rotate to cut the marble (40 m/s peripheral speed): n = (40 / 6.28  450)  60,000 = 850 RPM. Again, the peripheral speed depends on the material to cut, the harder the material, the lower the speed. The linear cutting speeds are indicated in the headers of the tables below.

At a minimum, new plane irons need to have their un-beveled side honed flat and polished to at least 4000 grit and preferably 8000 grit. You don't need to fuss with the entire surface; just the first 1/8" to 1/4" along the cutting edge will do. You also need to put a final honing on the bevel edge itself.

Uses of Granite. Granite is the rock most often quarried as a "dimension stone" (a natural rock material that will be cut into blocks or slabs of specific length, width, and thickness). Granite is hard enough to resist abrasion, strong enough to bear significant weight, inert enough to resist weathering, and it accepts a brilliant polish.
