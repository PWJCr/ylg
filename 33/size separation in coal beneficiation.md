Oct 5, 2020The dry separation methods for coal beneficiation have been regaining attention in the past decades. A number of improved or newly designed devices have been developedâone of them is a negative pressure pneumatic separator (NPPS). The said method of separation is based on the differences in the physical properties between coal and gangue minerals, such as the grain density, size, and shape.

Currently, the wet coal beneficiation process is the predominant method for coal upgrading. The wet beneficiation processes include heavy media separation, cyclone (water only), froth flotation, and spiral separation [23,24]. The use of these technologies depends on the particle size of the feed and the quality of the product required.

##  Study of The Separation Features of Fine Coal Cleaning in Kelsey 
Beneficiation of fine coal of size 150 x 300 Î¼m was studied in a laboratory Kelsey Jig. The thickness of the ragging bed is found to be an extremely crucial parameter apart from  In order to avoid the effect of feed size on the separation efficiency, mono-sized coal particles were used in this
