## Phosphorus in Steels - IspatGuru
It is present in varying concentrations in iron ore, is retained in hot metal, but is eliminated early in the steelmaking process. P oxidizes readily and is removed from steel as P2O5, which is taken up by the oxidizing slag, before the oxidation of carbon takes place.  Steels with very low phosphorus.

In Australia iron ore is won from three main sources:  High phosphorus iron can also be hardened by cold hammering. The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus. The more phosphorus, the harder the iron becomes and the more it can be hardened by hammering. Modern steel makers can increase hardness by as much as 30%

## Removal of phosphorus from iron ores by chemical leaching
Alkali-leaching and acid-leaching were proposed for the dephosphorization of Changde iron ore, which contains an average of 1.12% for phosphorus content. Sodium hydroxide, sulfuriced, hydrochloric and nitric acids were used for the preparation of leach solutions. The results show that phosphorus occurring as apatite phase could be removed by alkali-leaching, but those occurring in the iron
