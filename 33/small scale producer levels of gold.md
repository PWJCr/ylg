Mercury has long been used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore sediment and rock deposits. ASGM accounts for more than a third (38%) of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere, with most ASGM sector-related mercury emissions coming from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam.

## Reducing global mercury pollution from small-scale artisanal gold 
There are now a huge number of small-scale gold miners who scratch a living (literally) from poor-quality gold deposits. One essential step in the process to produce the end product, pure gold, uses mercury to capture the gold mixed in with rock and other minerals. The quantity of mercury released annually by small-scale gold miners alone is estimated to be 3000 tons‚Äî37 % of global mercury
