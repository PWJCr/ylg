The bentonite forms a pliable bond with the sand grains, so the mixture holds its shape well. Molten metal is then poured into the impression to make the casting. When complete, the bentonite and sand mold can then be broken away from the casting and reused. Bentonite is used as a binder for food pellets for animals and poultry and as a carrier

## Products - Black Hills Bentonite
Bentonite is used in the molding processes of metal casting. When mixed with foundry molding sands, Bentonite forms a pliable bond with the sand. Impressions are formed in the bentonite/sand mixtures, and then molten metal is poured into the impressions. Upon completion, the bentonite/sand mold is broken away from the casting face and reused.

Similarly, other consumables are increasing in cost like bentonite bond for green sand and chemical binders or no-bake. Fortunately, most foundry sands are reclaimable and can be effectively reused. Compared to thermal reclamation which typically ranges from $6.00-$8.00+ per ton the Pro-Claim, at approximately $1.00 per ton, is a much more cost
