## Limestone Aggregate Production - Melgaard Construction
Create a superior concrete - limestone bonds more tightly to the cement and is lighter-weight than gravel. Encourage proper drainage - limestone's permeability allows water to maintain its natural course while discouraging erosion. Have a low to non-existent silica content - this reduces the risk of an alkali-silica reaction.

## How Is The Processing Of Limestone Processed?
May 11, 2022Processes involved in processing limestone can be categorized as either wet or dry, depending on the purpose for which it is used. Fuel is the next step in processing limestone. Fuel is used in rotary kilns. This fuel burns with the limestone in a kiln. The resulting carbon dioxide and quicklime are calcined.
