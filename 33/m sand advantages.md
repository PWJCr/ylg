## Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) for Concrete - W. A. Perera & Co. (Pvt.) Ltd.
Since manufactured sand (M-Sand) is processed from selected quality of granite, it has the balanced physical and chemical properties for construction of concrete structures. This property of M-Sand helps the concrete structures withstand extreme environmental conditions and prevents the corrosion of reinforcement steel by reducing permeability
