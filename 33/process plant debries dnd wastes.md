## How Do Plants Get Rid of Waste?
Plants break down waste products at a much slower pace than animals. They convert a lot of their waste into useful substances through photosynthesis. Gaseous wastes are excreted during respiration through the plant's stomata and root cell walls. At night, when photosynthesis cannot occur, excess water is released through the tips of the leaves.
