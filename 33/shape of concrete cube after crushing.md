So, 100mmx100mmx100mm concrete cubes are used in place of 150mmx150mmx150mm cubes to raise the used stress to crush the concrete cubes. For normal concrete strength, the cube size of 150mmx150mmx150mm is already sufficient for the crushing strength of the machine.

The cubes should be covered with a damp cloth and a plastic sheet and stored in dry environment at a temperature range of 20 ± 5 degrees. The concrete cubes are removed from the moulds between 16 to 72 hours, usually this done after 24 hours. Make sure the cube ID is transferred to the cube from the mould before placing into a curing tank.

## Crushing or Crush Concrete Cubes or Cylinder at 28 days
The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures. The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix. Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength. When you crush it, the result should be equal or more than 60 Mpa. The specified strength should be achieved at 28
