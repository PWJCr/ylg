Carbon Steel. This is the basic steel, good 'ol carbon and iron, although some other very small amounts of other elements might be added. The three general categories are low, medium, and high carbon steel. More carbon means harder and stronger. Less carbon means cheaper, softer, and easier to produce.

1. 24 Karat Gold. 24k gold is the purest form of gold, measuring 99.9% pure. This metal is the shiniest, yellowest, and most expensive of all the different types of gold. Pure gold is hypoallergenic, which means it never causes skin irritation. It also has high resistance to tarnish and corrosion.

Modern industrial gold mining destroys landscapes and creates huge amounts of toxic waste. Due to the use of dirty practices such as open pit mining and cyanide heap leaching, mining companies generate about 20 tons of toxic waste for every .333-ounce gold ring. The waste, usually a gray liquid sludge, is laden with deadly cyanide and toxic

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

It does not readily combine with other substances and, therefore, does not corrode or tarnish. Because of this property, it is almost always found in nature as pure gold.
