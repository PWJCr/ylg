## Components of drilling machine and their functions - Studentlesson
In a drilling machine, single-phase ac motor is used, it can run at a rpm of 600 to 5000. More rpm is used for high drilling machine. The electric motor supply mechanical power from the pulley to the spindle and allows different speed. Pulley or gears. These components are used to transmit power and also for generating different speed.
