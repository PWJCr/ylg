Interlocking bricks are the enhanced form of conventional clay bricks.Each brick is constructively designed to lock itself to the other bricks around without the use of mortar. The self-locking is achieved using shear-key and lock mechanism. Based on the design, the shape of shear-key will vary and a complimentary lock is provided on the opposite side of brick.

Concrete strength also comes into play, but most slab concrete is around 3000 to 4000 psi, so it's not a major factor. The tensile strength of concrete is typically taken as 10 to 15% of the compressive strength, so only about 400 or 500 psi. Compare that to the tensile strength of Grade 60 rebar, which is 60,000 psi.

##  Abrasive Wear Resistance of Concrete in Connection with the Use  - MDPI
Some studies show that good concrete resistance is ensured by using a higher strength class, i.e., using a higher dose of cement, the addition of active mineral additive and a low water-cement ratio [8-10]. Although these theories show positive results, the microstructure of the composite must be taken into account.

## blast resistance of concrete Topic
Blast resistance is the ability of a material to withstand blast pressure from an explosion. Blast resistance design involves determining the kind and degree of resistance a structure needs as well as how to specify the required materials and details. A structural element subjected to a blast loading exhibits a higher strength than a similar element subjected to a static loading.

##  Concrete Interlocking Paving Blocks Compression Strength  - Ndt
Concrete compression strength is determined based on rebound corresponding to one test spot using common calibration relation whereas the hammer deviation from normal line is taken into account. 2.2 Test result evaluation according to ČSN EN Mean value results from all readings taking into account, if appropriate, hammer deviation from
