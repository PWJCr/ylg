## ball mill working principle | Henan Deya Machinery Co., Ltd.
Ball Mill Working Principle. Grinding is usually performed wet, although in certain applications dry grinding is used. When the mill is rotated, the mixture of medium, ore, and water, known as the mill charge, is intimately mixed; the medium comminuting the particles depends on the speed of rotation of the mill and the shell liner structure.

## grinding principles in ball mill
The principles of grinding are well established: the pre-ground liquor is pumped through the ball mill's grinding vessel in one or more stages. The refining action is accomplished by a special shaft with agitator arms and diverters rotating in a vertical jacketed grinding tank, which is filled with hardened steel balls.

## Comparison Grinding Principle of Ball Mill and Vertical Roller Mill
Oct 21, 2020Ball mills and vertical roller mill use different forces to achieve the necessary size reduction of clinker and gypsum plus other materials.. In ball milling, the size of the material is progressively reduced through the impact and attrition forces on the feed material as the rotation of the mill causes the tumbling action of the grinding media.
