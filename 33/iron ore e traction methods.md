## Iron Ore - Mining Artifacts
World consumption of iron ore grows 10% per annum on average with the main consumers being China, Japan, Korea, the United States and the European Union. Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined. There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently, depending on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits.

Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world's iron is used to produce steel. Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish-white metal. Other than meteorites that fall from the sky, iron is never found by itself in nature. Most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements.

Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed, so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as "dogger") allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting. However, he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip, this

At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.

The extraction of iron from its ores involves three stages - concentration calcination and reduction Calcination is the process of heating the ore to high temperatures in the absence of air to remove impurities such as moisture sulphur arsenic and carbon dioxide At this stage the ore becomes porous The calcined ore is then smelted Read More.

## Iron Ore Extraction Methods | Mining, Crushing, Grinding, Beneficiation
The most predominant surface mining methods used to extract iron ore are open-pit and open-cut methods. The decision to employ underground or surface mining techniques is dependent on the proximity of the ore body to the surface. Underground mining methods, including caving and stopping, were commonly used to extract iron ores.
