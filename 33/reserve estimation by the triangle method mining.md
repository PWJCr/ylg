## Ore Reserve Estimation Method - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Ore-reserve estimates include the determination of (1) tonnages of ore and (2) average grade or value per ton. Since the grade or content of valuable metal establishes the difference between rock that may and may not be classed as ore, tonnage cannot be estimated without considering the question of grade. Consideration of grade in connection

## Resource and Reserve Estimation and Classification - GeoSys Int
Resource Classification. The purpose of classifying resources is to provide a global confidence assessment to the project's stakeholders including mining partners, stockholders, and financial institutions investing in the project. There are several resource and reserve classification systems used by different government agencies around the world.

Battery-Grade Lithium Extraction The majority of the world's battery-grade lithium is produced by: Mining & acid leaching from spodumene ores, i.e. LiAl (SiO 3) 2, producing lithium sulfate solution, which is converted to battery-grade lithium carbonate or hydroxide via electrochemical processes.

## Mineral resource estimation
Mineral resource estimation is used to determine and define the ore tonnage and grade of a geological deposit, from the developed block model. There are different estimation methods used for different scenarios dependent upon the ore boundaries, geological deposit geometry, grade variability and the amount of time and money available.

## Placer Sampling and Reserve Estimation
After samples have been collected, washed, and assayed, reserves for a deposit can be estimated. There are many placer reserve estimation methods available. Some of these methods are the block, triangle, polygonal, cross sections, and diamonds. The figures below graphically demonstrate these methods:

Indeed, most of the better locations for agates in the state of Minnesota are spread along this stretch of highway. The beaches of Knife River, and the banks of the actual river, are both easy to access for agate.

The main disadvantages of the triangulation method are as follows: estimation results depend on triangulation pattern which is subjectively chosen; all drill hole intersections receive the same weight independently of the size and shape of the triangle; method is lacking of ability to implement a structural interpretation of the deposit.
