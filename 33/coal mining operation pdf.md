Longwall mining involves underground coal mining, whereby a long wall of coal is mined via a single slice, and the slice is usually from two feet to a little over three feet thick. The block of coal being mined, which is called the longwall panel, is normally approximately 270 to 430 yards in width and two to three miles in length.
