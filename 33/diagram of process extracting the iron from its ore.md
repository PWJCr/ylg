## Extraction of aluminium from bauxite pdf
chicken coops plans for sale Bauxite is the name given to aluminium ore. To generate aluminium oxide, bauxite is purified, a white powder from which aluminium can be extracted.Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point of more than 2000° C which makes melting very expensive.Aluminium oxide in water does not dissolve, but in molten cryolite, it dissolves.

## the process of extracting iron from its ore
Iron is extracted from the ore containing the maximum amount of iron. This is found near the surface of the Earth. Iron ore is converted to iron by various processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to extract pig iron. Pig iron comprises of about 92-94% iron and about 3-5% of carbon along with other impurities.

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

## Extraction Of Iron From Its Oxides - NextGurukul
Iron oxide, the ore from which iron to be extracted, is concentrated by roasting or calcination impurities can be eliminated.  Ellingham diagrams are useful in predicting the conditions under which a metal ore can be reduced to the metal. It gives information to predict the equilibrium temperature between the metal oxide and the metal
