## Belt Conveyor - Datasheet | Vention
As an example, a conveyor needs to move a load of 20 kg at 500mm/s up a 10 degree incline. The conveyor must occasionally be able to accelerate the mass at 0.5m/s^2. The width of the belt conveyor is 457mm. In this case our variables are 20kg for mass, 0.5m/s^2 for acceleration, 10 degrees for angle theta, and 120N for deformation force.

## Belt Conveyors: Components, Types, Design, and Applications - IQS Directory
A belt conveyor is a system designed to transport or move physical items like materials, goods, even people from one point to another. Unlike other conveying means that employ chains, spirals, hydraulics, etc., belt conveyors will move the items using a belt. It involves a loop of a flexible material stretched between rollers that are actuated

A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material. When motors in the pulleys operate at the same speed and spin in the same direction, the belt moves between the two. If objects are particularly heavy or bulky — or if the conveyor belt is carrying them for a long distance or

A belt conveyor can move light loads. It is characterized by the type of conveyor belt used (material, texture, thickness, width) and by the position of the motor unit (on the end, central, left, right, underneath, etc.). Some conveyor belts are designed to withstand very high temperatures. Rigid acetal belts can carry heavier loads.
