## Chromite | Chromium Ore, Properties, Uses and Occurrence
It occurs as layers in a few igneous rocks that are especially rich in iron and magnesium. Almost pure chromite is found in similar layers in sedimentary rocks. The layers are preserved when the sedimentary rocks metamorphose to form serpentinite. Referred to as chromitites, these rocks are the most important ores of chromium.

1 Description of nickel ore. The laterite nickel ore is complex in composition and can be roughly divided into two types: limonite type and silicon magnesium-nickel type. The main elements are nickel, cobalt and manganese. The laterite mining method generally uses open-pit mining. The ore body generally does not require rock drilling or blasting.

Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature; the others are iron, cobalt and gadolinium.Its Curie temperature is 355 °C (671 °F), meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.

## Nickel - Properties, Fabrication and Applications
Introduction. Nickel (Ni) was discovered in 1751 in Stockholm, Sweden by A.F. Cronstedt. It is a silver-white metal which mainly occurs in the arsenic and sulphide ores. It is extracted by roasting to NiO and then reducing with carbon. The Mond process is used to manufacture pure nickel, where in impure nickel reacts with carbon monoxide (CO

## High Density of Interfaces With Severely Mechanical Difference 
The synthesis of various heterogeneous structures has provided a new design principle for the unprecedented mechanical properties of metallic materials, such as strength-ductility synergy and extraordinary strain hardening. However, the key parameter that controls such properties remains a challenging issue. For solving this, a series of simulations of HSs with precisely controlled
