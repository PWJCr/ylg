Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

## How Granite Tile And Slabs Differ In Their Use?
Granite manufacturing starts from natural stone quarries. This is where raw granite is mined from the earth in the form of giant blocks. These blocks are then sent to the factory to carve out granite slabs and tiles. At the factory, a technician uses a gang saw or block saw to cut the giant blocks into slabs.
