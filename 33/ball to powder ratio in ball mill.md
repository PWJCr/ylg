As the ball-to-powder weight ratio increases, the particle size first decreases and then increases. As the ball-to-powder weight ratio increases from 15:1 to 25:1, the D 50 decreases from 172.2 nm to 103.6 nm. This result indicates that the milling energy per unit weight of the powder increases as the ball-to-powder weight ratio increases .

Based on powder particle size and impact energy required, balls with size of 10 to 30 mm are normally used. If the size of the balls is too small, impact energy may be too low for alloying to take place. In order to increase impact energy without increasing the rotational speed, balls with high density such as tungsten balls may be employed.

The ball to powder ratio (BPR) is a processing parameter that is frequently used in both mechanical (ball) milling and mechanical alloying. A number of recent studies provided the BPR as a principal milling parameter while neglecting other parameters, such the vial volume, the diameter and quantity of milling balls and the powder mass.

## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball Mill. For instance, a ball mill, which is a powder-processing technique involving deformation, cold welding, fracturing, and rewelding of powder particles, is used for mechanical alloying.  The ball-to-powder weight ratio is usually selected to be in the range between 10:1 and 50:1.
