## Use of Crushed Stone sand & its impact on Concrete Performance
The Concrete has been traditionally made with use of Natural / River sand as fine aggregate. As sand contributes to around 25 to 35% of total concrete along with coarse aggregates, cement & water, the properties of the fine aggregates would be one of the major influencing factor in determining the fresh & hardened Concrete properties and performance with respect to workability, durability

## Use of Crushed Stone sand & its impact on Concrete Performance
As the crushed stone sand is a byproduct of quarrying of coarse aggregates and it is being generated and supplied with or without proper screening, grading & washing. To meet the increasing demand of construction, the more rocks need to be separately crushed to get crushed / manufactured sand as replacement to natural sand.
