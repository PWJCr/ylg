2. At the sugar mill, the sugar cane stalks are washed and cut into shreds. Huge rollers press sugar cane juice out of the shredded stalks. 3. The juice is then clarified, concentrated and crystalized. 4. The crystals are spun in a centrifuge to remove the liquid and produce golden raw sugar. • Sweet fact: Raw sugar is 96-98% sucrose.

Dry Mill Ethanol Process. In dry milling, the entire grain kernel is first ground into "meal," then slurried with water to form a "mash.". Enzymes are added to the mash to convert starch to sugar. The mash is cooked, then cooled and transferred to fermenters. Yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to alcohol begins.
