Recoveries can be improved to 9599% by grinding to fairly fine particle size, gravity separation, cyanidation and flotation, all of which increase capital and operating costs. In some cases, oxidation of sulphide minerals is needed to liberate gold that

## -Research on raw ore process mineralogy of gold mine 
The particle size of gold in the ore is supposed to be very fine. It can be observed that most of the gold particles are below 10um, and more than 86% of the gold particles are less than 0.02mm. Therefore, the raw ore is a very refractory metallurgical ore with slight to ultra refined arsenic and carbon.

The recovery of silicates and clay minerals was exacerbated by their free, fine-, or ultrafine nature (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Grain size distribution data obtained via QEMSCAN analysis revealed that the silicate gangue minerals have a combined P 80 < 25 µm, making them susceptible to mechanical recovery, which was undesirable.

That really is the core "secret" of improving recovery of fine gold at commercial placer operations.

leach solutions are frequently high in solids due to fine particle washing from heaps. Down flow carbon columns are rarely used for gold recovery, because they act like sand filters and are subsequently subject to frequent plugging. 2.

Gold concentrates obtained from such a unit is referred to as gravity-recoverable gold. Investigations on gold recovery using Falcon concentrator have been reported [48,49,50]. Gold-bearing minerals of -74 µm can be recovered by Falcon concentrator at low water pressure, moderate pulp density, and high centrifugal field (200 g) . According to
