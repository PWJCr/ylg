## What are Thermal Properties of Copper Alloys - Definition
Copper based alloys have excellent thermal conductivity. Copper has a 60% higher thermal conductivity rating than aluminium, so it is better able to reduce thermal hot spots in electrical wiring systems. Thermal Properties of Copper Alloys. Copper alloys are alloys based on copper, in which the main alloying elements are Zn, Sn, Si, Al, Ni.

## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## Aluminium wire vs copper wire
The most likely and often identified culprits were: workmanship, thermal expansion differences, and creep. "However, newer AA-8000 aluminum alloys have creep rates very similar to copper building wire. This means that AA-8000 conductors perform very much like copper conductors at terminations.
