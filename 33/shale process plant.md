## » Processing Natural Gas NaturalGas
In order to recover elemental sulfur from the gas processing plant, the sulfur containing discharge from a gas sweetening process must be further treated. The process used to recover sulfur is known as the Claus process, and involves using thermal and catalytic reactions to extract the elemental sulfur from the hydrogen sulfide solution.

## Shale | Properties, Composition, Formation, Uses » Geology Science
Approximately 95% of the organic matter in the sedimentary rock is found in shale or mud. Shale is created by a process called compression. The shale exposed to extreme heat and pressure may vary in slate form. Once formed, the shale is usually released into lakes and rivers with slow-moving water. Clay is an important component in shale rocks.

It is not unlikely that the plant-organic-rich shale has potential for natural gas resources because the evolutionary pathway for coal and shale gas has a similar origin but different endpoints. 3. Materials and Methods  This reduction process increases the total organic carbon contents of sedimentary rocks through a biogenic origin [68,69
