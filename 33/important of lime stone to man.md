Limestone is a sedimentary rock mainly composed of calcium carbonate and calcite formed by marine organisms like coral, shellfish and algae. It holds up to 10% of the total volume of the sedimentary rocks. A pure limestone is white in color, however, with impurities like sand, minerals and clay, limestones are found in different colors too.

## What Are the Benefits of Using Limestone in Your Home?
Temperature Control. Like most natural stones, limestone acts as an effective insulator. It can help keep the temperature of your home's interior constant. This reduces the cost of heating and cooling your house, and alleviates the headache of constantly changing the temperature on your thermostat.

If we are mixing higher amount of Limestone then we get high amount of Calcium Oxides (CaO). It will help to desulfurize higher Sulfur or Sulfur dioxides (SO ₂). So it is most important to know the amount of Calcium Oxides (CaO) present in the lime stone that we are using. Lower the Calcium Oxides (CaO) will increases the Lime stone consumption.
