## Heap leaching a stack of gold - MiningFeeds
Heap leaching is used to extract gold, copper, silver, uranium, and iodine. This method was first employed to extract copper at the Bluebird mine in the US in the early 1960s, and then by several gold mines in the western parts of the US a few years later. Since then, heap leaching has been adopted successfully by many mines across the world.

## Lateritic nickel ore deposits
Heap leach treatment of nickel laterites is primarily applicable to clay-poor oxide-rich ore types where clay contents are low enough to allow percolation of acid through the heap. Generally, this route of production is much cheaper - up to half the cost of production - due to the lack of need to heat and pressurise the ore and acid.

Heap construction is an important link in the process of gold heap leaching. It should make the entire ore pile have similar permeability to avoid channeling or local blockage. Therefore, it is recommended to use advanced arc-shap ed heap construction equipment and adopt the process of " stacking in sections, cross spraying, multi-stage countercurrent leaching"; then inject air into the ore heap.

Heap leaching accounts for around 20% of the global production of copper. In heap leaching coarsely crushed ore particles are contacted with an aqueous lixiviant percolating through large packed beds (heaps) of the ore particles, with the loaded solution collected at the foot of the heap for metal recovery, solution make-up and recycle.

Heap leaching is used to extract gold, copper, silver, uranium, and iodine. This method was first employed to extract copper at the Bluebird mine in the US in the early 1960s, and then by several gold mines in the western parts of the US a few years later. Since then, heap leaching has been adopted successfully by many mines across the world.

##  Particle size distribution for copper heap leaching operations as 
In the heap leaching process, inclusions of the valuable minerals (copper bearing minerals) are to be dissolved from ore particles. The copper bearing minerals have some unknown grain size distribution, texture/exposure, and spatial distribution in the ore particles. In order to build a heap for copper recovery, the mined ore is crushed to an

## Heap leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the
