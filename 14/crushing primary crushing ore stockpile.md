Crushing is accomplished by compression of the ore against rigid surfaces or by impact against surfaces in a rigidly constrained motion path. Crushing is the first mechanical stage in the process of comminution. Stages of crushing: Primary crushing → Run-of-mine ore (ROM) reduced to 10-20 cm (4"-8"), ( " = inch = 2.54 cm)
