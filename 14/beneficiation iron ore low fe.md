## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Solving iron ore quality issues for low-carbon steel | IEEFA
DRI-electric arc furnace (EAF) technology is proven and in use today. However, it requires high-quality iron ore (DR-grade) with iron (Fe) content of 67% and above, which has lower levels of impurities. DR-grade iron ore currently makes up only about 4% of global iron ore supply. Some fossil fuel-based steelmaking supply chain incumbents

## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Rio Tinto Iron Ore's low-grade ore beneficiation plant in the Pilbara was commissioned in 1979. Initial engineering, design, and construction were undertaken by KBR (Kellogg Brown and Root) and Minenco (RTIO information provided to author, 2013).  They assay about 30% Fe with about 75% of the iron in the form of magnetite and the remainder
