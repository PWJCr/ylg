Figures 3(a) and 3(b) showed that an increasing PAM or PDADMAC concentration reduced the iron flotation recovery. However there was very little reduction in iron grade. When the concentration increased from 0 mg/L to 3 mg/L for PAM and 0 mg/L to 30 mg/L for PDADMAC, the recoveries of iron decreased from 74.66% to 66.74% and 74.66% to 64.63%, respectively.

In Brazil more than 250 M tons of iron ore concentrate production per annum is achieved using polysaccharides in the reverse flotation process to remove silica gangue. For example, in 1996 40,000 metric tons of corn starch were consumed in Brazil, out of which 80 % was used for iron ore concentration.

## Froth Flotation and its Application to Concentration of Low Grade Iron 
Froth flotation is a process used to separate minerals, suspended in liquids, by attaching them to gas bubbles to provide selective levitation of the solid particles. It is most extensively used process for the separation of chemi-cally similar minerals, and to concentrate ores for econo-mical smelting. Flotation is a selective process and can be used to achieve separation from complex ores

## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

Another method of concentration of ores is the Froth Flotation Method. This is the process for concentration of primarily sulphide ores. It has the advantage over gravity separation because it can collect even the extremely fine particles of minerals. The process uses the difference in the wetting characteristics of minerals and gangue.

##  Chapter-9 Froth Flotation and Its Application to Concentration  - Core
The flotation method of concentration, used extensively for other metal ores, has only recently been utilized for hematite iron ores. It can be applied as either the sole concentration process or as a final concentration stage to ensure a high-grade product. In the flotation process, air is bubbled through a suspension of fine iron ore in water

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

The major iron-bearing raw materials for steelmaking are blast-furnace iron, steel scrap, and direct-reduced iron (DRI). Liquid blast-furnace iron typically contains 3.8 to 4.5 percent carbon (C), 0.4 to 1.2 percent silicon (Si), 0.6 to 1.2 percent manganese (Mn), up to 0.2 percent phosphorus ore used, since phosphorus is not removed in the
