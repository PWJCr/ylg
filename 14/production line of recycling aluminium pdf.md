Sample Answer 1. The diagram illustrates how aluminium cans are recycled. First, the cans need to be taken to special collection centres instead of being thrown away with the normal refuse. The cans are collected from here and taken to a factory where they are first sorted and then cleaned. Next, the cans are shredded and crushed in a special

Aluminum alloys are widely used in the production of aerospace, aircraft, and automotive components. The die casting components are subjected to post-processing operations, such as milling and turning operations to get final shape, surface finish, and dimensional tolerances. During machining operations large quantities of material are removed from the cast components in the form of chips to

## Aluminium Scraps Recycling Melting and Process
Aluminium Scraps Recycling Melting is the process by which scraps aluminium can be reused in products after its initial production. The process involves simply re-melting the metal, which is far less expensive and energy-intensive than creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide (Al2O3), which must first be mined from bauxite ore and then refined using the Bayer process.
