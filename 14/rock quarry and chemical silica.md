##  Silica (quartz) Silica, SiO2 - California State University, Los Angeles
Silica is the dioxide form of silicon, SiO2, and occurs mostly as quartz sand, flint, and agate. Silica's powder form is used to manufacture glass, ceramics, etc. Silica SiO2 is the chemical compound silicon dioxide. It is formed when silicon is exposed to oxygen. It has a covalent bond and is a superior electric insulator, posessing high chemical

## Potential alkali silica reactivity of various rock types in an 
Generally, alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is considered as an internal chemical reaction between the alkaline components in the cement and active silica-silicate based mineral constituents of some aggregates. The use of aggregates susceptible of ASR in concrete can cause a severe degradation of the concrete structures because of several reasons e.g. high humidity and sea saline water

RCS occurs naturally and is a basic component of soil, sand & granite. A significant amount of silica is present in most rocks, clays, sands, gravel and shale. Quartz is easily the most common form of RCS present. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified RCS as a Group 1 cancer-causing agent.

Quartzite is a nonfoliated metamorphic rock composed almost entirely of quartz. It forms when a quartz-rich sandstone is altered by the heat, pressure, and chemical activity of metamorphism. Metamorphism recrystallizes the sand grains and the silica cement that binds them together.

## Health Hazards of Mining and Quarrying - ILO Encyclopaedia
The most common processes that produce respirable silica dust in mining and quarrying are drilling, blasting and cutting silica-containing rock. Most holes drilled for blasting are done with an air powered percussion drill mounted on a tractor crawler. The hole is made with a combination of rotation, impact and thrust of the drill bit.
