The porosity of lump iron ores for the DRI process is usually not limited, while the recommended value for the particle porosity for iron ore pellets is above 20% (HYL, 2010). In this study,  Table 3 shows some of the characteristic requirements on natural iron ore lump, pellets and sinters, to serve as a feed material to the main iron

## Iron ore
Mining of banded iron formations involves coarse crushing and screening, followed by rough crushing and fine grinding to comminute the ore to the point where the crystallized magnetite and quartz are fine enough that the quartz is left behind when the resultant powder is passed under a magnetic separator.

## Iron Ore Lumps
In Iron processing: Lumps and fines. As-mined Iron ore contains lumps of varying size, the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch). The blast furnace, however, requires lumps between 7 and 25 millimetres, so the ore must be crushed to reduce the maximum particle size. Crushed ore is

World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron. The only source of primary iron is iron ore, but before all that iron ore can be turned into steel, it must go through the sintering process. Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron and steel in a blast furnace.

## Direct reduced iron process - tec-science
The reduction of iron oxides takes place according to the following chemical equations: (1) F e 2 O 3 + 3 C O → 2 F e + 3 C O 2 (2) F e 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 → 2 F e + 3 H 2 O. In contrast to the blast furnace process, the direct-reduced iron process operates at temperatures of up to 1000 °C. The iron ores are therefore not melted!

## Iron Ore Lumps
In Iron processing: Lumps and fines. As-mined Iron ore contains lumps of varying size, the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch). The blast furnace, however, requires lumps between 7 and 25 millimetres, so the ore must be crushed to reduce the maximum particle size.

## 「lump ore mining processing magnetic separator」
TLYL Lump ore Dryic Separator tianlicidian. TLYL Lump ore Dryic Separator are widely used in iron plant for iron beneficiation. 1. After primary or intermediate crushing of the low grade iron ore, the waste materials such as rocks and sands are partially discharged to reduce to load of the follow up processes such as grinding, etc., greatly improving the productivity and reducing energy
