The weld area should be clean and free of oil, grease, dirt, paint, and oxides before welding. You can use a bronze wire brush followed by degreasing with a suitable cleaning agent to clean the surface. After each weld run is deposited, the oxide film formed during welding should also be removed with a wire brush.

The first step in this process is to further reduce the size of the copper wire by drawing it through wire draw #2. Operating the same way as wire draw #1, this process makes use of diamond dies to reduce a 10- or 12-awg wire to one 19-, 22-, 24- or 26-awg wire. After wire drawing, the wire is extremely brittle and can easily be fractured if
