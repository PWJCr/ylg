## Ag recovery from copper anode slime by acid leaching at atmospheric 
In this paper, recovery of silver from anode slime of Sarcheshmeh copper complex in Iran and subsequent synthesis of silver nanoparticles from leaching solution is investigated. Sarcheshmeh anode slime is mainly consisted of Cu, Ag, Pb and Se. Amount of Ag in the considered anode slime was 5.4% (by weight). The goal was to recover as much as possible Ag from anode slime at atmospheric pressure

## Behaviour of anode impurities in copper electrorefining: Effect of 
The behavior of sulfur and oxygen in copper electrorefining has been investigated. The form of anode slime and the dissolution state of the anode surface after electrolysis as well as the effect of dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte have been revealed. The anode passivation occurs depending on the concentration of oxygen and sulfur in the anode.

Combining conventional electrochemical measurements, laser-based visualization and digital image processing, the movement of anode slime, its spatial distribution and path of falling during the copper electrorefining process were investigated in a laboratory scale cell. Two types of anode slime, small agglomerates and fine particles were observed.

## Electrorefining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Each anode is electrorefined until about 80%-85% of the mass has dissolved. Two or three cathode plating cycles are produced from a single anode. Each copper cathode typically weighs 50-160 kg. This multicathode plating cycle ensures that cathodes do not grow too close to the slime-covered anodes and become contaminated.

This anode slime caused anode passivation. The passivation was accelerated with increasing the concentration of Sb, the Sb3+ ions and the dissolved oxygen in electrolyte. On the electrolysis of a copper anode containing antimony, arsenic and oxygen, the resulting slime composition was, in the large part of Cu3As, As2O3 and Sb2O3 in the small part.

## Copper Processing Costs Analysis
Copper Processing Costs Analysis. Copper processing products mainly adopt the pricing form of raw material price copper price processing fee in which the market price of copper material is relatively transparent and the profit level of copper processing enterprises mainly depends on processing costs. Due to the wide application fields of copper processing products

Tellurium, from Copper Anode Slime to High Purity . · Tellurium is a rare metalloid that is vastly produced from copper anode slime, which is a by-product of the copper electrorefining process. Choosing the proper recovery method strongly depends on the slimes composition, mineralogy, and tellurium concentration.
