## Pulverised Coal Combustion - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Markus Hurskainen, Pasi Vainikka, in Fuel Flexible Energy Generation, 2016. 7.2.3.1 General. Pulverised coal (PC) combustion is the most widely used technology for utility-scale power generation in the world. In PC boilers, coal is ground into fine particles (∼100 μm) and then injected with heated combustion air through a number of burners into the lower part of the furnace.

## Pulveriser in Thermal Power Plant | Bowl Mill | Ball Mill
Aug 5, 2021Introduction. The main Function of the Pulveriser in thermal power plant is to crush/grinding the raw coal coming from coal handling system through coal feeder into a pre-determined size in order to increase the surface area of the coal.. If the coal is not pulverised, the coal might not burn completely, thus resulting in wastage of fuel.
