## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

The Keonjhar-Nuakot volcanics shows ≈2 per cent Mn-Oxide while Sandur volcanics (southern India) gives ≈ 7 per cent Mn that shows its reappearance as Mn-deposit in the lower sediments. Add to it the exhalative materials, the answer is then found. In the case of iron, things are somewhat different.
