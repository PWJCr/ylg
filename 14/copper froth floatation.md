## 60 Centuries of Copper: The Flotation Process
The powdered product of grinding the ore is fed into a series of tanks called flotation cells which are filled with a solution containing various oils capable of forming a froth. Air is pumped into each cell, the solution being agitated to bring froth of bubbles to the surface. In the case of copper minerals, the particles adhere to this froth

Froth flotation, also called ore flotation when used in mining applications, is a method for physically separating particles by having air bubbles that selectively adhere to specific surfaces. The particles with attached air bubbles are carried to the surface and removed. Froth flotation is one of the most widely used methods for ore beneficiation.

Froth flotation cells to concentrate copper and nickel sulfide minerals, Falconbridge, Ontario. Froth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by exploiting differences in their hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity differences between valuable minerals and waste gangue are increased through the use of surfactants and wetting agents.

Copper is extracted from copper pyrites by froth flotation process. Froth flotation method is used to separate particles based on the differences in the ability of air bubbles to selectively attach to specific mineral surfaces in a mineral-water slurry. A finely crushed ore is suspended in water and a blast of air is passed through the suspension.

## Advantages and Disadvantage of Froth Flotation Method - Mining-pedia
Froth flotation method is a kind of mineral processing technology that the solid minerals emerge from water suspension (slurry) according to the physical and chemical properties of the mineral surface.. According to statistics, more than 60% ~ 70% ore in the world is separated by froth flotation method, involving more than one hundred kinds of minerals.
