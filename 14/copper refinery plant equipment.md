Our edible oil production process line portfolio. After oil clarification (for pressed oils), the oil can be refined as shown below. The crude oil is then transferred either to special degumming in the physical refining route, to water degumming, or directly to neutralization in the chemical refining route. In the chemical refining route, free fatty acids undergo a reaction to create aqueous.

The plant, which during the 1950's employed as many as 750 people, was where copper was refined and formed into a continuous-cast rod, which would then be turned into electric wire and cable. In 1986, the plant was compelled to install new pollution control equipment, in order to comply with new arsenic emission standards issued by the EPA.
