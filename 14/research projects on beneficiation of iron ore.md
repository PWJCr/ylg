Unfortunately, this large reserve cannot be utilized for the production of pig iron due to its high sulphur and phosphorus contents. In addition, the ore cannot be beneficiated easily like Itakpe and Oshokoshoko iron ores because of its texture. This work studied the beneficiation, dephosphorization and desulphurization of Agbaja iron ore.

Iron ores come in come in many shapes and sizes (and mineralogies), so there is no one size fits all approach to beneficiation. For magnetite ores, it is typically necessary to liberate the individual magnetite grains from the host rocks, after which beneficiation is relatively straightforward due to the magnetic properties of magnetite.
