Sep 13, 2021Gold detector and its working principle. The working principle of the gold detector follows the principle of metal detectors; It emits electromagnetic waves, and when the electromagnetic field of the transmitted wave affects a metal, it causes it to radiate electromagnetic waves, and these secondary waves are sensed by the detector coil and the device begins to ring.

## Can You Use a Metal Detector to Find Gold? | Orient Technology Group
Feb 21, 2021The simple answer to this question is: Yes, you can use a metal detector to find gold. because gold is a metal but with specific properties. In general, a metal detector can detect all types of metals, which are classified into two types, which are ferrous or magnetic metals such as iron, and the second class is non-ferrous.

Thallium is a chemical element with the symbol Tl and atomic number 81. It is a gray post-transition metal that is not found free in nature. When isolated, thallium resembles tin, but discolors when exposed to air.Chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861, in residues of sulfuric acid production. Both used the newly developed method of flame

## How to detect gold without a metal detector
How do metal detectors detect gold ? Eddy currents generate their own electromagnetic field, which the detector receives and analyzes. Gold detectors take this process a step further by measuring inductance and conductivity. Basically, inductance refers to the amount of eddy currents produced in the target.
