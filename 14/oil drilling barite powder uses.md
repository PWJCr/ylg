## Oil Based Mud Systems Benefits & Types (2022)
An oil based mud can be defined as a drilling fluid that has oil as its continuous external phase and the water, if present, is a dispersed or internal phase. The solids in an oil-based fluid are oil-wet, all drilling additives are oil dispersible and its filtrate is oil. The water, if present, is emulsified in the oil phase.
