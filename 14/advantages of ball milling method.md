## Discuss the ball Milling and Sol Gel Methods of Synthesis of Nano 
Ball milling is a method of production of nano materials. This process is used in producing metallic and ceramic nano materials. These mills are equipped with grinding media composed of wolfram carbide or steel. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.
