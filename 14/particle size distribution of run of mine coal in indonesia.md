Particle size and particle size distribution measurements are made by using the Ro-Tap method (ASTM D5644). Weight percents are plotted as a h c t i o n of particle size to get the particle size distribution. For higher performance products (e.g., tire carcass compound), variations in particle sizes and distributions are noted. Materials

## Particle-size distribution
The MMD is considered to be the average particle diameter by mass. σ g: Geometric standard deviation. This value is determined mathematically by the equation: σ g = D 84.13 /D 50 = D 50 /D 15.87 The value of σ g determines the slope of the least-squares regression curve. α: Relative standard deviation or degree of polydispersity.

The carbon raw material in the form of coke, coal or natural or synthetic graphite is ground and sieved (following calcination at °C to control volatiles, if necessary) to give a desired particle size distribution. The distribution depends upon the size of the artifact to be formed and the method of forming. [Pg.863]

Both the shape of the particle and the shape of the opening affect the size of particle which can pass through a given opening. For example, a particle in the form of a square plate can, in principle, pass through a square hole of side l if the length of edge of the plate is less than l √2.

## Identification of the initial particle size distribution for coal 
pulverized coal and the size range of 2510 -6 - 200×10 -6 ×m was divided into 10 bins 10 Many researchers adopted the same method as Backreedy et al. to set the initial PSD 11-15 Pedel et al. suggested that particles would behave significantly differently if their mass two not of the was

## Particle size distribution of coal and gangue after impact-crush 
The experimental results indicate that the Rosin-Rammler distribution could accurately describe the particle size distribution of broken coal and gangue under different impact velocities, and there is a minimum overlap region when the impact velocity is 12.10 m/s which leads to the minimum mixed degree of coal and gangue, and consequently the
