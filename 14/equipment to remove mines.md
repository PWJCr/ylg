## mining - Underground mining | Britannica
Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.

## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Basic Information about Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia
Large scale earth moving equipment is used to excavate and remove coal from lower layers. The equipment used depends on the method and scale of the surface mining method being employed. Regrading begins as coal excavation continues. Once coal removal is complete, final regrading takes place and the area is revegetated.

Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

Above ground, or surface mining, includes strip mining, open-pit mining, and mountaintop removal mining. Essentially, surface mining is the term used to describe any mining where the rock overlying the mineral deposit is removed. In underground mining, the overlying rock is left intact. Minerals are removed via shafts and tunnels.
