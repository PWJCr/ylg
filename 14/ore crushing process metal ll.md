When looking at overall crushing circuit design, having the correct number of crushing stages also helps minimize fines production. A typical crushing circuit will generate a reduction ration between 5:1 and 7:1 for maximum efficiency. For example, to generate a 10mm particle, you'll want to feed the crusher particles between 50 and 70mm.

The ore is conveyed, and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore. Following crushing through a jaw crusher (3), the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill (4) along with water and steel balls. The grinding process reduces the rock to a slurry. The SAG mill is a large revolving cylinder.

When looking at overall crushing circuit design, having the correct number of crushing stages also helps minimize fines production. A typical crushing circuit will generate a reduction ration between 5:1 and 7:1 for maximum efficiency. For example, to generate a 10mm particle, you'll want to feed the crusher particles between 50 and 70mm.
