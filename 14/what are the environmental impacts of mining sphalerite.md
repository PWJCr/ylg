## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.

## Electrochemistry of Sulfides: Process and Environmental Aspects
One of the main sources of non-ferrous and precious metals is sulfide ores. This paper presents a review of the existing literature on the electrochemical properties of some of the most common industrial sulfides, such as pentlandite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, pyrrhotite, pyrite, etc. The study results of the surface redox transformations of minerals, galvanic effect, cathodic oxygen
