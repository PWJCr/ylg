Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

Much like Keestrack's Jaw Crusher line, Keestrack's Cone Crusher line utilises Hydraulic and Electronic monitoring and protection circuits to protect the Cone from damage from packing and uncrushable materials. The first of these protections is the Hydroset piston which allows for slight movement to the C.S.S. during high load crushing.

Understanding the Cone Crusher. The first step in learning how to adjust a cone crusher is understanding the principles in place that allow the cone crusher to do its job. Based on the diagram above, we can identify the main parts of a cone crusher: the feed opening, the concaves, the mantle and the sizing gap.
