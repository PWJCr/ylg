## Aggregate Supply and Demand Graphs - AP Macroeconomics - Varsity Tutors
Correct answer: An increase in output and an increase in the price level. Explanation: A rightward shift of the demand curve (i.e. an increase of the demand curve) causes price and quantity to increase. Since the aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) model represents price as price level and quantity as output, a rightward shift of the

Aggregate demand and aggregate supply: The aggregate demand curve or simply called the AD curve is a pictorial representation of the inverse relationship that the aggregate quantity demanded holds with the general price level. Owing to this negative relationship, the AD curve obtains a downward slope.

Figure 1. The Aggregate Supply Curve Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical capital.

Aggregate supply refers to the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing and able to supply. The relationship between this quantity and the price level is different in the long and short run. So we will develop both a short-run and long-run aggregate supply curve.

The aggregate demand curve illustrates the relationship between two factors: the quantity of output that is demanded and the aggregate price level. Aggregate demand is expressed contingent upon a fixed level of the nominal money supply. There are many factors that can shift the AD curve.  Aggregate supply/demand graph.

It is the total amount of goods and services that firms are willing to sell at a given price level in an economy. There are two views on Long Run Aggregate Supply, the Monetarist view and the Keynesian view.
