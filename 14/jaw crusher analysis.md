## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.

"Successful jaw crusher maintenance requires the right resources, the right tools and the right approach," says Bill Macini, a Telsmith service technician.  A periodic oil analysis offers a heads-up about the condition of the machine. Also, changing the oil requires clean buckets, clean rags and storage in a clean environment.

## Jaw Crusher Lubrication Knowledge Analysis - DC Velocity
Since the large and medium jaw crusher bearings and the eccentric shaft are pressure cycle lubrication, when the oil pump fails, the jaw crusher needs to swing the power for 15-20 minutes to stop, so it is necessary to press the oil pump to apply oil to the bearing. Keeping it lubricated, there is no accident of burning the bearing.
