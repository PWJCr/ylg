## What is River sand? - LZZG
River sand profile. River sand is a kind of non-metallic ore with complex composition, smooth surface and high content of impurities that generated by repeated collided and rubbed of water for a long time in a natural stone state. River sand particles are smooth, relatively clean and with wide source. Particle size. River sand 4-8 mesh.

## The Difference Between Manufactured Sand, Natural River Sand, Mountain 
Manufactured sand is a sand-gravel material obtained after being crushed and screened by professional sand-making equipment. Compared with natural river sand, it has the characteristics of sharp edges and sharp edges and many needles and flakes. River sand is dug directly from the river channel, so it will be mixed with small pebbles and fine sand.

The M sand is manufactured by crushing quarry stones into required size & the crushed particles will look cubical shape with rounded edges and after washing it is turned as a construction material. The chemical composition of M sand is mostly similar to the river sand and the strength is little higher compared to the river sand.

## Manufactured Sand vs. Natural Sand - Chaney Enterprises
Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical. Spherical particles decrease the percentage of voids within the concrete mixture so no additional paste is required to fill these voids. Well-shaped natural sands are ideal for workability of mixtures.

## What Is Sand River? - Environmental project in Malaysia
Sand rivers, on the other hand, are rivers that are practically overflowing with sand. Sand rivers in arid regions are frequently devoid of both a headwater and an outflow. The runoff from isolated strong precipitation causes the water to flow fast into a river channel, forcing the water to flow until the water has been absorbed by the sediment.

The best part about river sand is its capability to refill itself. It can be combined with gravel, cement, steel, and water for the purpose of making concrete. Not only this, river sand can also make mortar for plastering and filling joints by using water and cement. Manufactured sand (m-sand) is made by crushing granite rocks into small particles.

## How does sand form? - National Ocean Service
Sand forms when rocks break down from weathering and eroding over thousands and even millions of years. Rocks take time to decompose, especially quartz (silica) and feldspar. Often starting thousands of miles from the ocean, rocks slowly travel down rivers and streams, constantly breaking down along the way.

## Manufactured Sand vs River Sand - A comparison
Understand the difference: M-Sand is short form for Manufactured Sand, an artificial sand made in factories by crushing rocks/granites. River Sand is self-explanatory, Sand that's sourced from the river banks or river beds which is naturally available. Due to the rising difficulties in sourcing River sand and its cost has given birth to M-sand, making it a fast-emerging alternative to sand.
