##  Conversion of Chromium Ore Processing Residue to Chrome Steel
Weber (1993) has also demonstrated that the chromite ore cannot be reduced by CO gas alone, in the absence of carbon. The ore can be reduced by carbon, but the reaction may proceed through two steps: FeCrO 4+ 4C Æ Fe + 2Cr + 4 CO 2and C + CO 2Æ 2CO. Carbon: the reductant amount / size / type Ding (1997) used graphite bought from Aldrich Chemical.

Apr 15, 2022Crop residues such as leaves, corn stovers, rice, wheat, oat, barley straws, and seed pods are some of the wastes generated in the agricultural fields. Crop residue production is currently projected to be 2802 Mt/y globally (Zabed et al., 2016a, 2016b). Only a small portion of wheat, corn, and rice crop residues is utilized in bioethanol

## Enhanced efficiency fertilisers: a review of formulation and nutrient 
The application of fertilisers in agricultural practices has markedly increased the production of food, feed, fuel, fibre and other plant products. However, a significant portion of nutrients applied in the field is not taken up by plants and is lost through leaching, volatilisation, nitrification, or other means.
