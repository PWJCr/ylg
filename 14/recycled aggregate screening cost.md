##  Recycled Aggregates from Inert Waste - Scottish Environment Protection 
Inert wastes suitable for producing recycled aggregate should be stored separately from mixed wastes and in a manner which prevents cross-contamination. Non-inert waste from household, commercial and industrial sources such as trommel fines produced from mixed waste is not permitted to be used in the manufacture of recycled aggregates.
