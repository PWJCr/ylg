## Decarbonizing copper smelting: a reliable method for carbon footprint 
In 2020, the world's primary and secondary copper production was about 24 Mtpa. Today, the demand of copper is growing much faster than the supply. The rapid increase of electrified transportation and industrial production, not to mention the new transmission capacity that we are going to need to power it all, are impacting the demand of copper.

## Copper extraction
Copper smelting technology gave rise to the Copper Age, aka Chalcolithic Age, and then the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age would not have been possible without humans developing smelting technology.  The modern froth flotation process was independently invented in the early 1900s in Australia by C.V Potter and around the same time by G. D. Delprat.

1. Compose the outer body. For small scale copper metal melting it will be sufficient to create a furnace 6 in. to 1 ft. in diameter. Furnaces are commonly shaped like cylindrical prisms. Bulk canned foods (such as peaches and soups) can provide a metal can of the proper size and shape for your DIY furnace.

Summary: A common theory is that copper smelting first appeared in the Near East in close connection with the early pottery industry. However, copper smelting may well have been discovered many times in history and at many places. Our hypothesis is that copper smelting could have been discovered when the copper-bearing mineral malachite, accidentally or intentionally, was present in lime
