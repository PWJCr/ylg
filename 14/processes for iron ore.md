## Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore
Its production process is basically similar, melting pig iron into hot metal and then adding some substances in the hot metal, such as oxygen, and iron ore, which makes it react with the carbon in the hot metal so as to reduce the carbon content in the hot metal. Then pour the purified hot metal into the mold and make it into steel after cooling.

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Extraction of Metals - Minerals, Ores & Iron Extraction Process
Ore is a naturally occurring substance from which elements can be extracted economically. Pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy and electrolytic reduction are three processes that are used for the extraction of metals. Important iron ores are : haemetite, magnetite, limonite, iron pyrite, siderite.

## Direct reduced iron
Process. Direct reduction processes can be divided roughly into two categories: gas-based, and coal-based. In both cases, the objective of the process is to remove the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below 1,200 °C (2,190 °F)).

## Ore | National Geographic Society
Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper, an excellent conductor of electricity, is used as electrical wire. Copper is also used in construction. It is a common material in pipes and plumbing material.
