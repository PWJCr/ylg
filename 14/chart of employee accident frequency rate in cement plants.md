## Calculating OSHA Incident Rates: TRIR, DART, LTIFR, and LTIIR
DART Rate Calculations. Calculating the OSHA DART rate involves a formula that defines the number of recordable incidents that resulted in days away, restrictions, or transfers per 100 full-time employees. A good DART rate is ideally lower than the TCIR/TRIR rate a company possesses.
