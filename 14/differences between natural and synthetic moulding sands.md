## What is the Difference Between Molding and Casting  - Pacific Research
The main difference between molding and casting is the use of the material in the process. Casting will typically involve metal, while molding focuses on plastics. In both cases, the melted material goes into a die or mold to create the final form. However, some other key differences in the process will change the final product.
