By Brent Rouppet, Ph.D. There are two key soil amendments in agriculture: (1) gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate [CaSO4 H2O]), and (2) liming materials such as limestone (CaCO3) and, dolomite ( (CaMg (CO3)2). Liming materials are applied to neutralize soil acidity, but in situations where Ca is required without the need for correcting soil

Alkaline soils have pH values of more than 7 pH. Alkaline soils may also have free carbonate, bicarbonate, and /or high magnesium. When soils have a pH value of more than 8, they may have elevated concentrations of sodium,(>15%). A sodic soil is a soil with high levels of exchangeable sodium (Na) and low levels of total salts.

What is Gypsum? Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) is a form of evaporite mineral commonly found in the sedimentary deposits of halite, anhydrite, calcite, sulfur, and dolomite. It contains high amounts of calcium and sulfur, which is why gypsum is also known as calcium sulfate.Often, people confuse gypsum or calcium sulfate with lime, whose chemical name is calcium carbonate.

Apply 0.5-1kg of gypsum per square metre of soil. Dig in and mix with soil. How do you apply gypsum to soil? Fill a lawn spreader with the recommended amount of gypsum and walk back and forth across your lawn to spread the gypsum, advises Espoma. For smaller garden areas, you can simply sprinkle the gypsum on the soil evenly.

## Use of Gypsum to Reclaim Salt Problems in Soils
Jan 24, 2022Gypsum is best applied routinely, as frequent irrigations leach out calcium from the root zone. This is even more important when water for irrigation is alkaline. If gypsum is not applied regularly and calcium content decreases in the soil, the soil tends again to get compacted and the infiltration of water slows down, creating stress to plants.

## Another option for outdoor growers is using
Another option for outdoor growers is using gypsum or calcium sulfate . Be aware of your soil's current pH level before you do this, however. If it is below 5.5, don't add gypsum at all because it then interacts with aluminum (Al) and will poison your plants!. A healthy balance, expressed as a percentage of soil bases, is 60-70 % calcium, 20-30 % magnesium, and 10 to 20 % potassium.

## Alkali soil
Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (greater than 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell and difficult to clarify/settle.

The pH increases because the H+ concentration has been reduced. Gypsum will not reduce soil pH. Calcium in the gypsum will displace H but the H remains in the soil solution so there is no change in soil pH due to gypsum per se. In very acid sub soils (pH 5.0 or less) aluminum becomes more soluble and is toxic to roots tips.

Sodic and magnesic soils are typically alkaline, i.e. they have a high pH. Lime is insoluble and therefore ineffective if the pH is high. It only reacts in acid soil where, the solubility of lime is adequate to supply calcium and increase pH. Gypsum has little or no effect on soil pH.

##  alkaline soil - Gypsum use in alkaline soils Harris - Soil Solutions
Managing alkaline soil pH is best done by maintaining high levels of free calcium in the soil. This is why gyp-sum is added to soils with high soil pH (>8.0). Gypsum is an excellent and inexpensive source of soluble calci-um. The soluble calcium removes the carbonate from the soil by forming limestone. This, in turn, lowers the soil pH.

## Use of Gypsum to Reclaim Salt Problems in Soils
Gypsum is best applied routinely, as frequent irrigations leach out calcium from the root zone. This is even more important when water for irrigation is alkaline. If gypsum is not applied regularly and calcium content decreases in the soil, the soil tends again to get compacted and the infiltration of water slows down, creating stress to plants.

## Saline and Alkaline Soil: Nature, Characteristics and Reclamation
For a sodic soil, suppose, CEC = 30 and ESP = 60, gypsum requirement to lower the ESP to 10, will be: or = 10 m.e. of Ca ++ per 100 gm. soil. Besides gypsum that is best soil amendment for sodic soil, several other materials may be used for reclaiming alkaline soils. Gypsum equivalents of some such materials are given below: (ii) Use of sulphur:
