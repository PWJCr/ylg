3) Stope Slope Accidents. In general, the depth of mining in open pit iron ore mines is large, so that the final slope needs to be retained for a longer period of time, and once the parameters of the open pit slope are not selected properly, it will lead to landslides and mudflow disasters, which will bring greater damage to the mining work

Open-pit is one of the most common mining methods used and starts from the earth's surface, maintaining exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped sides to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel, allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the site.
