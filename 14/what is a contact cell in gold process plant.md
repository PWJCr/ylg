## Who does a cell swell in a hypotonic solution?
Animal cells swell and burst due to absence of cell wall. This happens when a cell shrinks inside its cell wall while the cell wall remains intact. What causes a cell to swell up? Cell swelling occurs when the cell loses its ability to precisely control the influx of sodium (Na +) ions and water and efflux of potassium (K +) ions to the cytosol.

Gold milling, which is also known as fine grinding, pulverising or comminution, is a grinding process that reduces materials into a powder or finer sized particles. Milling is used to recover the maximum amount of gold from the ore by finely grinding it so that gold particles can be removed through gravity separation and/or chemical extraction.

Gold flotation. Flotation process is widely used for lode gold processing. In most cases, the flotation method has a good effect in sulfide-containing gold ore with high floatability. In addition, the flotation process is also used for polymetallic gold-bearing ores such as gold-copper, gold-lead, gold-copper-lead-zinc-sulfur ore.

The process also produces carbon monoxide. This is a problem because carbon monoxide 'poisons' the platinum catalyst that is used in a fuel cell. It becomes less efficient and eventually stops working. Gold could replace the platinum as a catalyst in the fuel cells. Not only is it cheaper, but gold is not affected by carbon monoxide.

## Gold CIL & CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.
