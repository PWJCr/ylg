The premise itself may seem simplistic, but the process of producing aggregate is anything but. As aggregate demand varies year-to-year due to a number of factors, the question stands: Exactly how much crushed stone, sand and gravel is produced in the United States on a yearly basis?  Production of construction sand and gravel was also down

Since the mid-1990s, local aggregate production has not been sufficient to meet local demand in the P-C Region. This shortfall has been met by importing construction aggregate, predominately sand, from neighboring aggregate producing regions.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Vacuum treatment (generally called vacuum degassing) is a commonly used steelmaking process, used for removing dissolved gases (e.g. hydrogen) from the steel. In this process, the steel is exposed to a vacuum which promotes transfer of dissolved gases from the liquid steel to gas phase.
