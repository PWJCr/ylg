## Limestone Based Cement Reduces Energy Consumption and  - SciTechDaily
A team of engineers at Drexel University have developed a "green" version of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). By using a form of alkali-activated cement that utilizes slag, limestone, and does not require heating to produce, their cement reduces energy consumption and carbon dioxide production by 97% and decreases material cost by 40%.

Portland-limestone cement, or PLC, is engineered with a higher limestone content than portland cement to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by about 10%. It performs just like the cement you're used to using, resulting in the same concrete you're used to having. The same specifications, the same mix design, now with a better carbon profile.

In the cement industry, the fuels combusted to heat the kiln account for about 40% of total cement manufacturing emissions. The remaining 60% are "process emissions" — i.e. when limestone is super heated. The Cement Division is pursuing a variety of innovative measures to further reduce the industry's carbon footprint.

## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
Because the limestone is softer than the clinker it will grind preferentially, resulting in a cement with a better particle size distribution with less energy. The limestone also requires less processing and does not undergo calcination, so it releases less waste in its production. The resulting cement will perform at least as well as cements

It is made by grinding a proportion of sand and limestone to produce low cost cement to be used in different usages other than concrete. Sand finely divided rocks and limestone spread clearly in those types of cement so they are slightly porous due to sediment of sand and limestone in the pores. Limestone is 25% while sand is 30% of cement weight.
