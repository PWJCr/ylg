## Calculation Of Cement And Sand In Cum
Aug 03, 2018 Now we start calculation for find Cement, Sand and Aggregate quality in 1 cubic meter concrete. CALCULATION FOR CEMENT QUANTITY; Cement= (1/5.5) x 1.54 = 0.28 m 3 ∴ 1 is a part of cement, 5.5 is sum of ratio Density of Cement is 1440/m 3 = 0.28 x 1440 = 403.2 kg We know each bag of cement is 50 kg
