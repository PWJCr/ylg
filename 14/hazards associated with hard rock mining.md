## Underground Mining Techniques and Risks | Geology for Investors
In hard rock mines, the ore itself doesn't give off lethal, explosive gases, but the exhaust fumes from vehicles do. In addition, the great depths that some mines reach, means that the geothermal gradient can see wall rocks as warm as 45C, making ventilation and air-conditioning necessary.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by
