Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

How many years does it take limestone to form? Limestone stalactites form extremely slowly - usually less than 10cm every thousand years - and radiometric dating has shown that some are over 190 000 years old.Stalactites can also form by a different chemical process when water drips through concrete and this is much faster.
