Aluminum production first begins with smelters extracting aluminum from bauxite (sedimentary rock) during a two-step aluminum smelting process. The Bayer process separates alumina from bauxite. Also known as aluminum oxide, alumina then undergoes the Hall-HÃ©roult process, producing pure aluminum. Each step decreases material quantity by half.

What is smelting waste called? Slag, the stony waste matter separated from metals during the smelting or refining of ore, is formed from impurities in the iron ores (known as the gangue), the flux and coke ash; it is a complex mixture of silica, alumina, sulfides and oxides of calcium and magnesium, as well as smaller amounts of manganese and iron
