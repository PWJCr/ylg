lime is used as sorbent material instead of limestone. It is known that, the hydrated lime possesses higher desulfurization capacity than limestone due to its higher solubility and higher alkalinity in slurry and better reactivity with SO2 at low temperature (Ma et al., 2000; Özyuğuran et al., 2006).

## The things you need to know about limestone desulfurization - Clirik
The limestone wet flue gas desulfurization process is generally operated under the condition of a pH value of less than 6.2, which can increase the solubility of limestone. When the pH value is between 5.5 and 6.0, most of the SO2 absorbed by the circulating slurry exists in the form of HSO3- and cannot be combined with H+.

## Effect of additives on mercury partitioning in wet-limestone flue-gas 
Abstract. The wet-flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) process plays an important role in removing water-soluble flue-gas components such as sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and oxidized mercury compounds.Under the reducing environment of the FGD, there is the possibility of re-emission of the already absorbed mercury (Hg) to the gas phase, which may be diminished by the utilization of specific additives.

## Model of the Wet Limestone Flue Gas Desulfurization Process for Cost 
A detailed process model of the wet limestone flue gas desulfurization system has been presented. This model can be used to calculate indispensable parameters for estimating costs and next to minimize capital and operating costs. The process model describes most important stage of SO2 removal running in an absorber and a holding tank. It includes absorption of sulfur dioxide, oxidation of SO3

## Limestone scrubbing is used to remove SO2 in a flue - Chegg
A limestone mix is used that consists of 95% CaCO3 and 5% inert material. The actual feed rate of the limestone mix is 35,000 lb/hr. The SO2 in the flue gas is 21,314 lb/hr and the FGD efficiency is 96%. If the resulting sludge has 60%; Question: Limestone scrubbing is used to remove SO2 in a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system.
