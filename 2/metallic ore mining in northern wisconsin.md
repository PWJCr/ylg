##  Cumulative Impacts of Metallic Mining Development in Northern Wisconsin
Over the past twenty-five years of metallic mineral exploration in northern Wisconsin, four orebodies (areas of mineralization that may be economically feasible to mine) have been located and defined. One, the Flambeau Mine near Ladysmith has been successfully reclaimed. Reclamation of the pit began in early 1997 and was completed in late 1998.
