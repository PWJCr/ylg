## Beneficiation of coal pond ash by physical separation techniques
It was found that coal pond ash was heterogeneous in nature consisting of particles that varied in terms of their size and composition.

Therefore, the possibility of separating coal pond ash was tested on standard equipment typically used for gravity concentration.

The basic purpose of beneficiation is to reduce the ash forming impurities from raw coal so that better coal with less ash content can be produced. If these ash forming constituents are not removed, and coal is directly charged to the coke-ovens, the ash content in coke will increase and subsequently more slag will be produced in the blast furnace thereby lowering the efficiency of the blast furnace.

In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

## Beneficiation Of Coal Using Gravity Method - HN droled mine treatment 
A method of beneficiating coal in a dry process includes separating raw coal from a coal mine into coal fines and larger pieces of coal using pressurized air, separating the larger pieces of coal according to size, removing ash from the larger pieces of coal on an air table, and further removing ash from the larger pieces of coal using a size-discriminating device to obtain a beneficiated coal

Dry separation method was used at the beginning of 20th century to separate coal separation process. First industrial applications of dry separation took place in the middle of 1930s. At that time
