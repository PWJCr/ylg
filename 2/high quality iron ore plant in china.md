## How China is moving beyond Australia for its iron ore hunger
Despite the tensions, and despite China's desire to move away from its reliance on Australia, the iron ore trade between the two countries is still booming. "In 2020, Australia remained the largest supplier of iron ore with 732Mt, up from 691Mt in 2019, mainly due to higher quality and favourable transportation cost," says GlobalData
