Aqua regia gold refining tumbler. This refining system consists of a large PPl cylinder inclined to an angle of 25°, it continuously rotates by means of a special motor, with the possibility to adjust the rotation speed. The rotation forces the grains to rub against each other and consequently a rapid and effcient dissolution process is induced.

Platinum group metals (PGM) are refined using highly sophisticated chemical methods that are particular to their composition. The use of the right compounds, as well as the chemical reactions that occur, makes it easier to separate PGM from other elements that may be attached. Refining is the process of purifying an impure metal in metallurgy.

About the only contaminate in the gold will be a little iron from the ferrous sulfate. If you have Pt or Pd, it is common to first use ferrous sulfate. Then re-dissolve in aqua regia and drop a second time with a sulfite such as sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, or SO2. If you do this right, you should end up with at least 999.5 Fine gold.

## Using Aqua regia | Gold Refining & Metal Extraction Forum
Mar 29, 2008. #17. When I started refining, in 1966, I used a standard AR mix of 3/1 or 4/1, HCl/HNO3, and always evaporated to eliminate the HNO3. In about 1980, I worked for a guy that ran mostly karat gold - about 50 to 100 oz/day. He never evaporated or used urea.

## What is Aqua Regia, and what makes it royal? - Sustainable Nano
