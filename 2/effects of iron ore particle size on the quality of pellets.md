The results of SEM-EDS analyses showed that the reduction of fluorapatite in the iron ore was activated when using -0.1 mm iron ore and the reduced phosphorus melting into metallic iron. Moreover, the particle size of coal has less effect on the direct reduction-magnetic separation than iron ore within the scope of the study.

## Investigation of iron ore particle size and shape on green pellet quality
ABSTRACT Particle size and shape of iron ore concentrate are effective parameters in the production of quality green pellets. In this research, the effect of particle morphology on green pellet quality was studied. It was concluded that pellet quality improved with increasing specific surface area. Drop number and green compression strength of pellets ground by HPGR were found to be superior

## Effect of Particle Size on Mechanical Properties of Pellets Made from 
A pellet made from smaller particle size gains higher strength due to decrease in gaps that have been filled by the smaller particles more than the pellet made from larger particle size. A change in particle size affects the yield strength of pellet due to the level of applied stress to cause the particle boundary to failure.

## Iron Ore Concentrate Particle Size Controlling Through  - SpringerLink
By applying the load slowly on ore particles, the HPGR breaks the grains, minimizing energy loss as heat and noise. The possibility to regrind the mineral to adjust the surface area for pelletizing needs after dewatering, without any addition of water to the process, is a second strong motivation. Fig. 1

## Influence of Iron Ore Fines Feed Size on Microstructure, Productivity 
Too much variation in coarser and finer particle size range in sinter mix, the behavior of these +10 mm and -0.15 mm particles have been a subject of investigation and it is necessary to understand the role of iron ore particle size on sinter microstructure, sinter strength, sinter RDI, and productivity.
