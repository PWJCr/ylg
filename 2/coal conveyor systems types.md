## Fresh Approaches for Coal Conveyors - Coal Age
Conveyors serve as the arterial system for coal mines and prep plants. Longwalls and continuous miner sections are often limited by conveyor capacity and availability. Likewise, prep plants rely on conveyors to deliver raw coal and to transport clean coal and tailings to the refuse impoundment.  ICLAM can provide all types of conveyor belt

## Conveyor System Safety - Machinery Safety 101
Defining a Conveyor System. At its most basic, a conveyor system consists of a continuous moving surface that moves material from one location to another. Conveyors can be divided into two basic types: bulk material and package or unit handling. Bulk materials range from powders to crushed ores and other similar materials.
