## The beneficiation of tailing of coal preparation plant by heavy-medium 
Dense-medium cyclones have been used for beneficiation of fine particles of coal. In this study, the usability of cyclones in the beneficiation of tailings of a coal preparation plant was investigated. For this purpose, separation tests were conducted using spiral concentrator and heavy medium cyclones with the specific weight of medium 1.3-1.8 (g/cm3) on different grading fractions of

## coal - Problems associated with the use of coal | Britannica
Coal is abundant and inexpensive. Assuming that current rates of usage and production do not change, estimates of reserves indicate that enough coal remains to last more than 200 years. There are, however, a variety of problems associated with the use of coal. Mining operations are hazardous. Each year hundreds of coal miners lose their lives or are seriously injured.

The hard coal beneficiation process in mechanical preparation plants generates coarse, small or fines rejects and coal tailings slurries. The tailings are the finest grain size, with the majority below ~ 0.25 mm, whereby material sized below 0.035 mm makes up to 60% share in the slurry composition.

The coal being mined is of high vitrinite content and is commonly known as "hard coking coal". The value of coking coal is significantly higher than steam coal. It is therefore important to optimize the plant yield and recover the maximum percentage from coal mined at very high expenses due to difficult geological conditions.
