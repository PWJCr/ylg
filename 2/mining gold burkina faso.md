## Child miners pay the price in Burkina Faso's gold rush
Child mining has become a growing problem in Burkina Faso, where 60 percent of the population is under 25. A mining boom in recent years has made the country Africa's fourth-largest gold producer, where exports of the yellow metal account for almost a fifth of economic output.

## Growth in Burkina Faso gold mining fuels human trafficking
Burkina Faso is one of several countries mentioned in the legislation as being high-risk, and therefore requiring extra oversight.
