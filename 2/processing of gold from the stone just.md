The process is about oxidation and dissolving of metallic gold in an alkaline cyanide solution. Atmospheric oxygen acts as the oxidant in the process. The oxidant helps to dissolve the gold and forms sodium hydroxide as well as sodium cyanoaurite. An aqueous solution of sodium cyanide must be present with the oxidant to ensure the same.

## How Is Gold Formed? Origins and Process - ThoughtCo
Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay. Gold cannot be produced via chemistry or alchemy. Chemical reactions cannot change the number of protons within an atom.
