## Bauxite-india
The first step in producing aluminium is mining its ore bauxite. Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface Bauxite occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas, like Africa, the West Indies, South America, Australia & India there are some small deposits located in Europe.

## Bauxite Resources in India - Geography Notes - Prepp
Apr 7, 2022Apr 7, 2022. Bauxite is an ore that is used in the production of aluminum. Bauxite is found primarily in tertiary deposits and is commonly associated with laterite rocks found on the plateaus and hill ranges of peninsular India, as well as along the country's coasts. India produced over 20 million metric tonnes of bauxite.
