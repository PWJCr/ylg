## A Shake Table Earthquake Lesson Plan - BrightHub Education
Four rubber balls or bouncy balls, about one inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. To construct the shake table, place one board on top of the other, lining up the sides. Stretch the rubber bands around the boards on two opposite sides to hold the boards together. Slide the rubber bands in so that they are about 1 inch from the outer edge of the board.

Your building will be considered "earthquake proof" if it can retain its complete structure on the shake table and not fall over during a period of 10 seconds of shaking the table. For the height, the highest point of the roof will be measured. The roof must be where 3 or more pieces come to a point or where four corners imply a flat roof surface.

In this science fair project you will focus on the pushing and pulling P-waves. You will see what happens when the waves shake houses that are sitting on different types of soil models: bedrock, gravel, alluvium, and sand. Engineers and seismologists create special shake hazard maps, which show where these different soil types are located.

##  All About Earthquakes: The Science Behind Earthquakes
earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake. Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake?
