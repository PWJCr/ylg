Manganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn. It is a silvery white metal with a hard brittle structure that belongs to the group 7. Manganese are the fifth most abundant metal found in the crust of the earth that are distributed widely in many countries.It is not found as a free element in nature, but present in the combination with iron.

Its principal use is in steelmaking, where it serves as a purifying agent in iron-ore refining and as an alloy that converts iron into steel. Although the amount of manganese consumed to make a ton of steel is small, ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms, it is an irreplaceable component in the production of this fundamental material.

Historically, Tennessee's most important mining products have been iron, bituminous coal, copper, lead, zinc, and phosphate. Iron ore was the most significant during early settlement years. Interest in the iron ore of the Western Highland Rim dates back to the 1790s and even earlier in the eastern mountains.

## Manganese
This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe 2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio.

The purpose is to remove iron and phosphorus from manganese. The pyrogenic process has merits like simple process and stable production, which can effectively separate iron and phosphorus from manganese ore to obtain low-iron, low-phosphorus manganese-rich slag. The manganese-rich slag generally contains Mn 35-45%.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
