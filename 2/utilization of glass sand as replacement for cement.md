## Fiber cement boardsscontainer
Fiber cement board are composed of cement, silica sand and wood pulp. Reinforced fiber cement products such as fiber cement board are manufactured using the 'Hatscheck Process'. The Hatsheck process was initially developed for the production of asbestos composites, but it is now used for the manufacture of non-asbestos, cellulose fiber reinforced cement composites.

## Eco-Friendly Alternatives To Traditional Concrete
Posted on July 18, 2019. Concrete is a mixture of cement, gravel, sand, water and a range of aggregates. With about 10 billion tons of concrete produced every year, it is the most consumed substance in the world, second only to water.. It is also the world's most widely used material for construction - from bridges to large buildings, concrete forms the very foundation of our infrastructure.
