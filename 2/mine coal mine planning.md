In 2019, methane emissions from coal mining and abandoned coal mines accounted for about 8% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 1% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (based on global warming potential). Some mines capture and use or sell the coalbed.

## Mine Ventilation - Ventilation control of dust in coal mines - GRT
Ventilation control of dust in coal mines is important in the different types of underground coal mining such as (1) room and pillar mining, (2) longwall mining and (3) shaft mining. Type (1) is done in an ore deposit where some of the ore is left behind to form columns in the mine that prevents it from collapsing and it is used for coal mining
