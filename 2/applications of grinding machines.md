## Factors affecting proper coolant application when grinding
Bernoulli's energy equation can be used to predict the pressure that creates the desired jet velocity. For example, a grinding wheel moving at 12,000 sfm (3,657 m/min.) requires a nozzle pressure close to 270 psi (18.6 bar) for the coolant jet to match the wheel speed. Lower wheel speeds require lower pressures.
