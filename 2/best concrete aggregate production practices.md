Most natural sands and gravel from riverbeds or seashores are smooth and rounded and are excellent aggregates. Crushed stone produces much more angular and elongated aggregates, which have a higher surface-to-volume ratio, better bond characteristics but require more cement paste to produce a workable mixture.

## Aggregates - Cement
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

To ensure good coarse aggregate compaction and higher concrete density, it is recommended to mix 20 mm and 10 mm coarse aggregates in the ratio of 70:30 or 60:40. It is recommended to stack different aggregate sizes to use them efficiently. Prevent the use of friable and chert aggregates. The former is susceptible to splitting, whereas the
