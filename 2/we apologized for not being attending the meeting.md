We regret to say, because enrollment has been insufficient for the May 10 ETC seminar, we are being forced to cancel it. Dr. Harvard, our keynote speaker scheduled for the May 9 Kansas City meeting, has canceled because of unexpected surgery. Finding a replacement of his caliber at such a late date would be highly unlikely.
