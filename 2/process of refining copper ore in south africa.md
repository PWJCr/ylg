## Location Factors: Zinc, Lead, Copper Refining & Acid industries - Mrunal
Overall, Indian copper ore is average quality, hence mining/refining is a costly because copper yield is low. Lead and Zinc. Dig the ore=>concentrate=> refining. it runs on the principle that certain minerals have an affinity for certain oils. Hence the ore is mixed with water, oil and chemicals.

Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

The now concentrated ore is smelted for further refinement, eventually reaching purity levels of between 99% and 99.5%. Industrial-scale copper mining in Africa typically goes back as far as 1966, to when the Palabora Mining Company opened the first open-cast copper mine in South Africa, known as the Palabora Copper Mine.

2.2. Chalcopyrite Ore Processing. The first step in the chalcopyrite processing is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents such as alumina, limestone, pyrite and silica so that the copper and non-ferrous mineral values are concentrated into a product containing between 20 to 30 percent copper.

## Copper Purification Process - Electrolytic Copper Refining Plant
Electrolytic refining (electrorefining) is a process used to make impure copper pure. Unlike aluminum, copper metal is fairly easy to obtain chemically from its ores. By electrolysis, it can be refined and made very pure—up to 99.999%. The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide

Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to
