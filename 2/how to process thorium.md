## Thorium Element Facts
Commercially thorium is extracted from monazite sand (phosphate mineral). The chemical inertness of monazite makes extraction a complex and multi-stage process. (6) Thorium metal can be isolated by electrolysis of the anhydrous thorium chloride with calcium. Isotopes: Thorium has 28 isotopes whose half-lives are known, with mass numbers 210 to

## Why are there no thorium reactors?pro
Score: 4.3/5 (4 votes) . Thorium cannot in itself power a reactor; unlike natural uranium, it does not contain enough fissile material to initiate a nuclear chain reaction.As a result it must first be bombarded with neutrons to produce the highly radioactive isotope uranium-233 - 'so these are really U-233 reactors,' says Karamoskos.

A thorium reactor is a form of nuclear energy, proposed for use as a molten salt reactor. It is fueled by the uranium-233 isotope that is taken from the element thorium. Thorium is weakly radioactive, has a high melting point, and is available with more abundance than uranium as an element.  The start-up process could be lengthy and costly.

Thorium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal that is found in soil, rock, and water. It is formed by the radioactive decay of uranium. Minerals such as monazite, thorite, and thorianite are rich in thorium and may be mined for the metal. Thorium has coloring properties that have made it useful in ceramic glazes.

## Radionuclide Basics: Thorium | US EPA
Jul 5, 2022Radionuclide Basics: Thorium. Thorium (chemical symbol Th) is a naturally occurring radioactive metal found at trace levels in soil, rocks, water, plants and animals. Thorium is solid under normal conditions. There are natural and man-made forms of thorium, all of which are radioactive. In general, naturally occurring thorium exists as Th-232

## Fact-check: Five claims about thorium made by Andrew Yang
These arguments are in reference to solid-fuel thorium reactors, when the design being most discussed for the past decade is a liquid-fueled thorium reactor (LFTR). The latter is greatly superior regarding resistance to weaponization. There are two options with conventional solid-uranium fueled LWR waste: store or re-process.
