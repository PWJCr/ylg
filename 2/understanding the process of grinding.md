## Tutorial:The grinding process - Sinotech
Grinding. Grinding is a finishing process used to improve surface finish, abrade hard materials, and tighten the tolerance on flat and cylindrical surfaces by removing a small amount of material. Information in this section is organized according to the subcategory links in the menu bar to the left. In grinding, an abrasive material rubs against the metal part and removes tiny pieces of material.
