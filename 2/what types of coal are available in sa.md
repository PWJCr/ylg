## What Type Of Coal Is Best For Blacksmithing? - ToolsOwner
Bituminous coal is the best blacksmithing fuel. It burns cleanly, cokes up well, making fire management a breeze, and produces little clinker. Go for the kind that is metallurgical grade because it produces sufficient heat, low smoke, and low sulfur. If bituminous coal isn't available in your area, use charcoal.
