## Mining - Open pit mine | ArcelorMittal
Most iron ore mining operations use the 'open pit' method, where miners drill into the rock and blast the ore-bearing material loose with explosives. Huge excavators are then used to gather the loosened ore. To mine metallurgical coal, which will later be turned into coke, it's usually necessary to sink vertical mine shafts to access coal

## The Open-Pit Mining Method Is Used When Large Coal Or Ore Deposits Are 
The Open-pit Mining Method Is Used When Large Coal Or Ore Deposits Are Found _____.? Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling (as would be the case for sand cinder and gravel).

PA Mining History. Room-and-pillar mines have been active in Pennsylvania's bituminous coalfields since the late-1700s. Bituminous coal was first mined in Pennsylvania at "Coal Hill" (Mount Washington), just across the Monongahela River from the city of Pittsburgh. The coal was extracted from drift mines in the Pittsburgh coal seam, which

## What is open pit coal mining?m.youramys
How does open pit coal mining work? Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.  To create an open-pit mine, the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground. This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground, then plotting each hole location on a map.

Chemical use is use in g open pit mining, which involves the use of harsh chemicals to extract minerals from the rock. These chemicals seep into the soil which makes it harder for anything to grow and can run off into water sources which poisons animals and plants. After mining finishes, the mine area must undergo rehabilitation.

## Open-pit mine simulation for better planning - SCDA
Step 1: Setting up the open-pit mine simulation model. The first step to set up the simulation is to import the mine layout and specify the equipment, the mine plan, and many other input parameters and constraints inside the model. Once the scenario has been imported and checked for setup errors by the platform, we can verify the setup with the
