LIME KILN DESCRIPTION In pulp and paper mill, the lime kiln is a bottle neck for most Kraft pulp mill. In calcination process, lime is cooked/calcined at 800c in a kiln.We are providing shafts kilns and rotary kilns for calcining of limestone/lime sludge with multi fuel options. Prior to calcination, exhaust gases of kiln preheat lime. Get Price

## Calcining - Vulcan® Drying Systems
Calcining - also known as calcination - is a thermal treatment process that uses extremely high temperatures to change the physical and chemical properties of various solid materials, including minerals, metals, and ore. Calcining is used in a variety of industrial applications within the mineral processing, recycling, and manufacturing industries.

A lime kiln is used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce quicklime also called burnt lime. usually, the heat is around 900 degree celsius, but a temperature around 1000 degree celsius is used to make the calcination process more quickly. excessive temperature is discouraged because it produces deadburned lime which is unreactive.

## Lime Shaft Kilns - ScienceDirect
Heat consumption of different lime kiln types Calcination of limestone and dolomite is an energy intensive endothermal process. Until today the thermal energy in lime kilns is provided by combustion of fuels. Depending on the availability of the fuels the cost of thermal energy varies between 20% and 50% of the production cost.
