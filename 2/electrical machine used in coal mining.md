Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground it can be extracted through surface mining. In surface mining workers simply remove any overlying sediment vegetation and rock called overburden.

Coal mines operated without electricity. Electricity began to be adopted in mining and manufacturing in the late 1880s and the 1890s. (Electricity was first introduced into Ohio's bituminous coal mines in 1889.) The introduction of electricity in coal mines greatly facilitated the introduction of laborsaving machinery.

Roof support at the face (the area where coal is actively mined) is intended to hold the immediate roof above the coal face. In modern mechanized mines, roof bolting is the most common method employed. Steel bolts, usually 1.2 to 2 metres long and 15 to 25 millimetres in diameter, are inserted in holes drilled into the roof by an electric rotary drill and are secured by either friction or resin.
