Rotating Machines. The crewman in Fig. 4.25 exerts the forces shown on the handles of the coffee grinder winch, where F = 4j + 32k N. Determine the total moment he exerts (a) about point O,(b) about the axis of the winch, which coincides with the X axis.. Strategy (a) To obtain the total moment about point O, we must sum the moments of the two forces about O.

## What Is A Grinding Machine? How Should The Daily Maintenance of The 
Grinding machines remove material from the workpiece by abrasion, which can generate substantial amounts of heat. To cool the workpiece so that it does not overheat and go outside its tolerance, grinding machines incorporate a coolant. The coolant also benefits the machinist as the heat generated may cause burns.
