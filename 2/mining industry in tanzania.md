## Mining in Tanzania: Status and Challenges - Resource Governance 
Tanzania's mining sector has grown rapidly in recent years. This study provides background information on the industry, its impacts, and the legal and political environment of its operation. It argues for a joint effort of all stakeholders to overcome typical challenges of the extractive resource industry in Africa, in order to make Tanzania the "best performer in her class".
