Cut-Off grade is the minimum grade required in order for a mineral or metal to be economically mined (or processed). Material found to be above this grade is considered to be ore, while material below this grade is considered to be waste. Although in a variety of units can be used, the cut-off grade is usually expressed as: g/t (grams per tonne)

## iron ore cut off grade calculation
Iron Ore Cut Off Grade Calculation. 2017 6 26The cut off grade is the arbitrarily defined lowest grade which will be mined from an ore ore deposit and usually defines the boundary of the deposit. For example if the average grade of a porphyry deposit is 0.5 Cu the cut off might be 0.2 Cu. any rock with a grade below 0.2 Cu would be waste.

Cut-off Grade Theory and Practice. Consider a block of ore that weighs 1 tonne and contains 3 grams of gold. At a gold price of US$1000 per ounce the value of the gold in the block of ore is just under $96 ($1000/31 X 3 or $1000 per ounce/ 31 grams (troy ounce) X 3 grams of gold) Simply put, if it were to cost more than $96 to mine, treat, and

## Cut-off grades - MiningMath
The concept of cut-off grade has been conceived to delineate what is ore and waste, considering the life of mine. Usually, manual assumptions are made to pre-define what must be considered ore or not, while using the LG or Pseudoflow methodologies.These approaches do not consider the value of the money through time in the decision-making process, which could generate a whole different mining

## Ore Reserve Estimation Method - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Thus, in the Lake Superior iron-ore districts curves have been constructed showing the variation in cubic feet per ton with variations in iron content. One of these is shown in figure 11, A.  erratic high assays were cut to $100 in stopes known to be high-grade and to $50 in low-grade stopes. Where diamond-drill-hole assays are used in ore

## Cut Off Grades Explained - Next Investors
A cut-off grade is the grade at which a mineral deposit can be economically mined or processed. Cut-off grades can change based on a number of factors, including the type of deposit (shallow or deep), commodity prices, ease of access, location and many more factors that impact costs of mining. Cut off grades determine which drilling intercepts
