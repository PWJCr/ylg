## The History of Tin Mining - Who Discovered Tin and When | Tinplate
The use of tin as a plating material dates to the time of the Roman Empire, when copper vessels were coated with tin to keep them looking bright. Tinned iron vessels appeared in central Europe in the 1300's. In 2010 archaeologists uncovered a vessel off the Devon Coast, which is thought to date back to around 900 BC.

Tin Mining Town The early history of Ipoh as a settlement was all down to its mining industry, although it did rather play second fiddle to nearby Gopeng, some 19 km / 12 miles to the south. The first incarnation of Ipoh did not last long, as a fire swept through the town in 1892, meaning that it needed to be subsequently rebuilt.

Chinese Gravel Pump Mining. A relatively small area in Malaya, about 200 miles long by 40 miles wide, is the most important source of tin in the world. Some tin is recovered in other parts of the peninsula. Of the tin mined, 98 pct is recovered from alluvial deposits. From 1935 to 1941 the average annual world production of tin was 190,000 tons.
