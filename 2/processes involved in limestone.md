The growth of FGD during the mid-to-late '80s, as well as the early '90s, was almost entirely due to the increase of the wet limestone process capacity. From 1994 through 1998, there was a step increase in the installed FGD capacity with most of this being attributed to wet limestone processes and the dolomitic lime process in the United States. 20

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Calcite and aragonite are crystal forms of CaCO3. Limestone makes up approximately 10 percent of all the sedimentary rocks in the world. Limestone may form many erosional land formations when in contact with acid. Limestone is typically white; however, impurities present

## An Explanation of How Limestone Caves are Formed at Every Stage
Limestone is a sedimentary rock mainly composed of calcium carbonate and calcite formed by marine organisms like coral, shellfish and algae. It holds up to 10% of the total volume of the sedimentary rocks. A pure limestone is white in color, however, with impurities like sand, minerals and clay, limestones are found in different colors too.
