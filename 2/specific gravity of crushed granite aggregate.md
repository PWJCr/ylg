## Specific Gravity of Fine Aggregate as per IS 2386 Part-3 (1963 
The specific gravity of fine aggregate (sand) is considered to be around 2.65 to 2.67. Sand particles composed of quartz have a specific gravity between 2.65 to 2.67. While inorganic clays generally range from 2.70 to 2.80. Soils with large amounts of organic matter or porous particles (such as diatomaceous earth) have specific gravity below 2.

## Density of Aggregate - Bulk and Relative Density - Civil Engineering
If the volume is unit then, Bulk Density= Mass. Unit in kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3. In this definition, the volume is that contains both the aggregates and the voids between aggregates particles. The approximate bulk density of aggregate that is commonly used in normal-weight concrete is between kg/m3 (75-110 lb/ft3) .

## Classification of Aggregates based on Grain Size, Shape, Specific 
4.) Flaky Aggregates - The aggregate is said to be flaky when the least dimension of aggregate is less than 3/5th (or 60%) of its mean dimension. Mean dimension is the average size through which the particles pass and the sieve size on which these are retained. For example, mean size of the particles passing through 20 mm sieve and retained on 16 mm sieve is (20+16)/2=18 mm.
