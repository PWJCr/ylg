## Iron Ore Pelletizing - Perantech
These pellets are essentially agglomerated iron ore, whose tumbling index is better than that of the iron ore parent material. They are produced by mixing several ingredients such as iron ore, limestone, betonite and dolomite at high temperatures around 1300°C. Perantech has been working in this field for many years and is proud to supply the

## Pelletizing
The formation of raw iron ore pellets, also known as pelletizing, has the objective of producing pellets in an appropriate band of sizes and with mechanical properties high usefulness during the stresses of transference, transport, and use. For example, waste materials are ground before being heated and introduced into a press for compression. [6]

Aug 31, 2021Iron ore pellets are hardened, small spheres with a maximum diameter of about 20mm. They are mostly used as raw materials in iron/steel manufacturing industries such as Sree Metaliks. Pelletizing, as a process, was introduced to the world only post WWII. There was a scarcity of high-grade natural iron ore in the US.

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black
