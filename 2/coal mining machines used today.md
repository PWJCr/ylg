Longwall Miner Twenty percent to 30 percent of mined coal underground is from longwall mining. This is performed by a mechanical cutter that shears coal off from a panel on the seam. The panel being worked on may be up to 800 feet in width and 7,000 feet in length. Mined coal is deposited onto a conveyor that moves the coal to a collection area.

It is unclear exactly when the first continuous mining vehicle was developed. The English Channel Machine built in the 1870s and ran on compressed air could possibly be counted, but most agree that the technology was first used in mining in the early 1900s. In 1912, for example, the Hoadley Knight Machine was developed for mining coal.

Surface mining is used to produce most of the coal in the U.S. because it is less expensive than underground mining. Surface mining can be used when the coal is buried less than 200 feet underground. In surface mining, giant machines remove the top-soil and layers of rock to expose large beds of coal. Once the mining is finished,

Roof support at the face (the area where coal is actively mined) is intended to hold the immediate roof above the coal face. In modern mechanized mines, roof bolting is the most common method employed. Steel bolts, usually 1.2 to 2 metres long and 15 to 25 millimetres in diameter, are inserted in holes drilled into the roof by an electric rotary drill and are secured by either friction or resin.
