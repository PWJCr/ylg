Mineral sand deposits are formed from the erosion and weathering of pre-existing igneous rocks such as granite, pegmatite and basalt. Over 60 to 200 million years the combinations of wind and water from ancient rivers and seas have leached the minerals from their past rocks and concentrated them into beach and dune deposits.
