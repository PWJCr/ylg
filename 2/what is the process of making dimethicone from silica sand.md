First, the stone material is initially crushed by the coarse crusher, and then, the produced coarse material is transported by the belt conveyor to the fine crusher for further crushing. The finely crushed stone material enters the vibrating screen to screen out two kinds of stones to meet the requirements of the sand making machine.

Silica is an important material in catalysis, as it is used as a support itself and it is a silicon source for the synthesis of zeolites and clays. State of the art of the preparation of silica is by neutralising basic waterglass solutions (sodium silicate) or the pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride at high temperatures.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
