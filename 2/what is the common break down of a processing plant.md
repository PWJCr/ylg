## EPC Project Delivery Method - Capital Cost Estimating
The best way to explain what constitutes Owner's costs is to break down the project capital costs from the top down. The most common way to break down the capital cost of a project, with the EPC element in it, is: The direct costs are all the costs included in the EPC contract: All costs shown above are in base-year currency.

In chemical process plants, the electricity demand is generally determined by the work or energy required for compression, pumping, air cooling, lights, and many other items. This electricity often times is purchased from local electricity providers, but many plants generate their own electricity via sophisticated processes.

Renewal. That is the beautiful end-result of decay. When plants break down in place, they become part of a balanced eco-system, setting the stage for new life to emerge. But when dead plant matter is taken from its home turf and carted away, the nutrients and minerals are lost to the soils that produced them.

The absorbed water nourishes the embryo of the seed which in turn aids the process of cell duplication. This causes the embryo to expand causing the embryonic plant to emerge from the seed. In simpler terms, when a mature seed falls to the ground, it absorbs the moisture from the soil, which in turn propels the seed to decompose and eventually give way to a new plant.
