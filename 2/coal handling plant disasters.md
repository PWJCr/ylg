## Coal Handling Plant Essay - 7246 Words
COAL HANDLING PLANT Introduction Coal is the primary fuel for production of electricity in our country. The importance and magnitude of the business of coal handling is emphasized by the fact that more than 60% of India's total installed generating capacity consists of coal fired stations. A 200 MW unit consumes about 2500 tones of cal everyday.

everywhere that coal is handled, processed or stored. Safe coal handling practices are designed to ensure that the fuel remains intact throughout its journey from the mine until the point at which it is ignited in the boiler. It takes as little as 1.4 kg (3 lbs) of pulverised coal in 28 m3 (1,000 ft3) of air to form an explosive mixture.

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.

Coal Handling Plant. Coal transported to the plant by the rail line and carrier trucks. This coal is transfer from the underground bunker to crusher by series of conveyer belt. In coal crusher coal size reduced up to Â¾ after that coal transfer to the boilers coal bunker or coal yard. In the case of emergency the coal is fetch from coal yard.
