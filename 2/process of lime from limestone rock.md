11.17 Lime Manufacturing 11.17.1 Process Description1-5 Lime is the high-temperature product of the calcination of limestone. Although limestone deposits are found in every state, only a small portion is pure enough for industrial lime manufacturing. To be classified as limestone, the rock must contain at least 50 percent calcium carbonate.

## What is Quicklime and How is it Made? - Science Struck
After the limestone rocks are processed, they are transported to a lime kiln for calcination. This is the process where the limestone is heated to a temperature above 1,472ºF for decarbonation, i.e., removal of carbon dioxide in gaseous form, to produce quicklime. Almost half of the limestone's weight is lost as carbon dioxide.

## An Explanation of How Limestone Caves are Formed at Every Stage
Limestone is a sedimentary rock mainly composed of calcium carbonate and calcite formed by marine organisms like coral, shellfish and algae. It holds up to 10% of the total volume of the sedimentary rocks. A pure limestone is white in color, however, with impurities like sand, minerals and clay, limestones are found in different colors too.

As the limestone dissolves, the rocks will wear away, becoming pitted with rounded edges. The dissolution process will change the appearance of the landscape as the rocks slowly wear away over time. Limestone particles in soil will dissolve into rainwater and leach the calcium from the topsoil, which reduces its availability for plant life.

Limestone origins. Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of more than 50% calcium carbonate. Although it occurs in many different forms, its origins can be traced back to either chemical or biochemical processes that occurred in the geological past, often tens to hundreds of millions of years ago.

##  Limestone Quarrying and Processing: A Life-Cycle Inventory
2.1 Limestone Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate with the occasional presence of magnesium. Most limestone is biochemical in origin meaning the calcium carbonate in the stone originated from shelled oceanic creatures. Limestone can also be chemical in origin as is the case with travertine.

It is a type of fluffy powder. When it is heated up to 1200K it decomposes carbon dioxide. We can produce calcium carbonate by passing carbon dioxide through calcium hydroxide. The chemical formula for preparing limestone: Ca (OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3+H2O. Thus, the chemical name of limestone is calcium carbonate CaCO3.

## Process Of Limestone Rocks
1117 Lime Manufacturing.11.17.1 Process Description 1-5 Lime is the high-temperature product of the calcination of limestone. Although limestone deposits are found in every state, only a small portion is pure enough for industrial lime manufacturing. To be classified as limestone, the rock must contain at least 50 percent calcium carbonate.
