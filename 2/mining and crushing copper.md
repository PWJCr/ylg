## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
The first steps of copper processing are the same for both ores: mining and transporting. Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.

Crusher Machine for Open Pit Copper Mining. In open pit copper mining operation, crushing is the first processing stage. Copper ore crushing may be performed in two or three stages. Primary crushing circuit consists of crushers, feeders, dust control systems, and conveyors used to transport ore to coarse ore storage or further crushing plant

Two of the almost four identical crushing plants are equipped with a KB 63-89 gyratory crusher, while the other two plants are equipped with the largest Gyratory Crusher KB 63 -130 Pro, which, thanks to its compact design, has the same overall height as its "smaller brother" and thus enables the same plant concept with higher throughputs up to 11,000 t/h at only a slight additional weight.

## Primary Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In the Aitik copper mine a raised specific charge from 0.9 to 1.3 kg/m 3 gave rise to an increase in the throughput by nearly 7% due to more fines produced and shorter grinding time achieved [28]. Similarly, a high specific charge from 2 to 3.0 kg/m 3 resulted in an increase in the mill throughput by 20-40% [29]. View chapter Purchase book
