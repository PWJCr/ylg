The goal is to grind the ore just enough for optimum copper mineral liberation in the froth flotation plant circuit. Under-grinding reduces recovery; overgrinding reduces throughput and wastes energy. Real-time particle size analysis in slurry is the key to effective grinding control in finer particle sizes prior to froth flotation.

## Copper | KGHM Corporate Website
The main source of copper produced by KGHM are mines solely owned by the company. The exception is Sierra Gorda mine in Chile, which is now at the commissioning stage, where KGHM owns 55% of shares. The remaining mines are located in Poland (Lubin, Rudna, Polkowice-Sieroszowice), Chile (Franke, Sierra Gorda), Canada (McCreedy, Morrison) and the USA (Carlota, Robinson).

## What is a copper ore mining plant? - Quora
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Promoted by The Penny Hoarder

## Copper Processing | Multotec
Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.
