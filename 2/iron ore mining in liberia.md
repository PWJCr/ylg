Iron ore ArcelorMittal Liberia's iron ore is a direct shipped iron ore (DSO) product. DSO means that apart from some primary crushing, screening and blending at the mine, the iron ore is mined, shipped and consumed in about the same form as it is extracted from the ground. DSO is a sintering fines material.
