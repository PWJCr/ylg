At any one of these stages, the pre-cast concrete modules can become subject to stresses that overload the structure. If these stresses occur in the concrete's early ages they may result in permanent cracks. You need to employ lifting procedures that disperse the load across the structure in order to reduce the risk of overload stresses.

The chisel impacts concrete structures at high speed. The reach (6-7.5 m) of the backhoe arm allows the workers to stay away from the structure being dismantled.

Fill the cone with the concrete sample in three stages. Once each stage is filled, tamp the mix with the tamping rod 25 times. After the third tamping the excess concrete shall be struck off flush to the top of the cone. Lift the mould carefully upwards, to minimise disturbance of the concrete inside. The concrete will slump.
