The Leigou bauxite mining area of Chinalco Zhongzhou Aluminum Co., Ltd. has a designed annual production capacity of 800,000 tons. It is currently the largest underground bauxite mining mine in China, but the mining license will expire on November 25, which means If the new mining license cannot be obtained in advance, production may be interrupted.

## Mining Greece Bauxite
Greece holds a very important place, not only in the European Union, but also at a global level, as it is one of the major bauxite producing countries. 90% of the mining of bauxite in our country takes place in underground exploitations and 10% in opencast ones. The measured amounts of bauxite in Greece amount to approximately 130,000,000 tons

The objective of this research is to give the life cycle inventory for underground bauxite mining. The inventory is based on realistic data collected during the three years of mining in Bešpelj Mine near Jajce. Time scale analysis and statistical analysis of data enable the modelling of the inventory for different outputs of ore.

## Bauxite mining in the United States
Bauxite forms by the weathering of aluminum-rich and silica-poor rocks in hot, humid, climates, at places with good drainage. Under the proper conditions, weathering disintegrates the aluminium silicate minerals, and dissolves and removes the silica, creating bauxite. The mined US bauxite deposits have all been in the southeastern United States.

Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe 2 O 3), the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and small

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

Underground Mining. Underground mining has the potential for tunnel collapses and land subsidence (Betournay, 2011). It involves large-scale movements of waste rock and vegetation, similar to open pit mining. Additionally, like most traditional forms of mining, underground mining can release toxic compounds into the air and water.
