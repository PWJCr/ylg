Alluvial Gold Mining Production Line Process Description Crushing and Screening. Many alluvial gold ores contain cementing mud pie and most of its particle size is over 100 mm, which will be excluded together with the waste rock in the process of screening if not being crushed, thus is a loss of gold vibrating screen and trommel are the commonly used screening equipment, which has long service

## History of gold mining in Victoria - Earth Resources
Victoria is a world-renowned gold province and our history is closely connected to gold mining. Gold discovery at Ballarat in 1851 sparked Victoria's famous gold rush. An estimated 6000 diggers (miners) arrived each week seeking their fortune. Ballarat was considered the world's richest alluvial goldfield during its peak between 1852 and 1853.

In fact, artisanal miners often process alluvial, colluvial and eluvial, or secondary, ore deposits until they reach bedrock. However, based on the idea that gold in most alluvial ores is liberated, artisanal miners rarely invest in efficient comminution processes when processing colluvial or eluvial ores.

This kind of mining is generally not considered acceptable because of the high impact on the environment. However, there are other tools gold miners can use. One of the more popular ways to mine rivers of alluvial gold today is the gold dredge . These can vary in size from a backpack unit to great floating barges the size of hotels.

Using a gold wash plant, exposed gold-bearing gravels are mined using a bulldozer that pushes and stockpiles the gravel near a wash plant.The stockpiled gold-bearing gravel is then fed into the wash plant by a front-end loader or large backhoe. This practice promotes equipment efficiency by allowing the bulldozer to continue mining while the loader or backhoe feeds the wash plant at a steady rate.

His find led to only a small patch of alluvial gold - by April 1853 less than £1,200 worth had been won.
