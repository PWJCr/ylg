## Types Of Equipment For Open Cast Coal Mines
In this article we will discuss about the types of drilling methods used in mining. The types are 1. Percussive Drilling 2. Rotary Drilling. the common type of drill bit which consists of a cylindrical cast steel shell having in its lower face a number of small sockets in which pieces of black diamonds are set. as coal mines are rarely.

## 10 Different Types of Mining Operations and Mines - Nayturr
Longwall mining involves underground coal mining, whereby a long wall of coal is mined via a single slice, and the slice is usually from two feet to a little over three feet thick. The block of coal being mined, which is called the longwall panel, is normally approximately 270 to 430 yards in width and two to three miles in length.

## The Mining Life: Open Pit vs. Underground - Micromine
There's an obvious distinction between open pit mines and underground mines that leads to the main differences from the miners' perspectives. Open pit mines allow for heavy machinery and workers to do their jobs in the open and usually with more maneuverability. Open pit mines don't have to safeguard against loss of air and cave-ins, but

## Electrical Distribution, Protection and Controls in Mines
The main advantage in open-cast mining is that it is much more safer and, at the same time, the rate of coal production per day is at least two to three times more than that in the underground. Moreover, in the open cast mining system, all electrical equipment are not needed to be flame-proof, instead mining type electrical equipment can be used.

Underground v.s. Surface Coal Mines: Is Deep Drilling  While underground mining requires an array of resources, equipment and financial backing, the method is best suited if the environment and coal potential harmonize. Longwall mining accounts for 50 percent of coal mines in the world and is much safer than other methods of coal mining.

During the pillar splitting process, miners turn roadways created during the initial workings into pillars. Some companies prefer to make pockets instead of full roads. When using the pillar splitting method, miners must complete their extraction quickly. Due to the stress of mining, the pillars can become unstable.
