Mining also creates knock-on effects â€” like water pollution, air pollution and vegetation loss as a result of soil eruption. This can lead to greater habitat loss beyond the immediate location. Habitat Destruction Caused By Mining Habitats can be restored after mining operations are finished, but some impacts will linger.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

## Environmental impact of iron ore mining
Water is one of the major natural resources that is being polluted by iron ore mining operation. Pollution reduces with increasing distance away from the iron ore mining sites. [13] Metals are leached out, and acid water carries them downstream to the sea in sloppy regions. Water bodies are polluted during iron ore mining operations.
