## Cement manufacturing - components of a cement plant
Summary of production process. Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

## Design a new cement plant - Page 1 of 1 - International Cement Review
Re: Design a new cement plant. Normal practice is to locate the cement plant close to the limestone quarry. This is because 44% of the calcium carbonate, CaCO3, in the limestone will be lost as CO2 in the exhaust gases from the kiln. It is therefore a waste of energy and cost to transport that embodied CO2 a long distance to the cement plant.
