The minimum crushing strength of brick is 3.50N/mm 2. If it is less than 3.50 N/mm 2, then don't use the bricks in construction. Hardness test Use a sharp nail or make scratch marks on the bricks. A good brick is resistant to any scratches and marks on its surface. If the brick does not hold any scratch marks, then it is called as a hard brick
