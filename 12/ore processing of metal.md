## Ways to Separate Metal From Ore | Sciencing
The process of separating a metal from its ore is known as smelting. Smelting is widely practiced today and has a long history dating back to the Bronze Age, when ancient peoples first learned the technique. Smelting methods range from the basic to the high-tech, and are applied to a variety of materials, including aluminum, iron and copper.

What are metal ores for kids? An ore is a natural combination of minerals from which metals can be extracted at a profit. Originally the term ore was applied only to metallic minerals but the term now includes nonmetallic substances that have been deposited in rock after its formation. All metals come from ore deposits found in the Earth's crust.

Ore processing is a chain of processing applications which treats run of mine to firstly high-grade concentrate (concentration of ores) and then to the pure mineral or metal. The refined ore is used in manufacturing equipment and machinery in numerous industries, or is for sale in industry, commerce and consumer industries.

## Metal Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Processing of the metal ore forces the electrons from other ions (oxygen, etc.) that are being removed by the process to attach to the outer shell of the metal ion to form the completed metal atom. This now places the metal in an 'unnatural' state. This is one of the reasons why a metal will corrode when placed in an accommodating electrolyte.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
An ore of a metal is an impure source. It consists of many impurities other than metal such as sand, clay, etc. These impurities are known as gangue which is commercially useless so we must separate it from ore. This process is known as the concentration of ores. Concentration removes water and other impurities such as sulphur and carbonates.
