## 5 Reasons to Use Limestone in Your Soil - Grit
Limestone Prevents Toxicities in the Soil When the soil in your field or garden reaches an acidic pH level, certain nutrients such as aluminum, manganese, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and iron elevate to toxic levels. Not only will limestone prevent the build-up of these nutrients, but it will safely improve the calcium level as well.

## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium
