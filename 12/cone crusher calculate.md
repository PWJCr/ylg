This inefficient use of connected horsepower will result in a higher energy cost per ton of material crushed (kW/hr per ton). Approximately 70% of the total lube oil flow rate is being used to keep the cone crusher cool. When the actual lube oil flow rate decreases below 70%, the crusher will operate warmer than previously.

There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor.  Make sure the cone crusher does not get ring bounce or chatter. Variable flow controlled by level sensors will ensure consistent feeding and maintain a full crushing chamber. Low oil temperature should prevent operation of the unit.
