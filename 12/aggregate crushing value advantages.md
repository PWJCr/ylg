## 7 Lab Tests on Aggregate to Check Quality for Use in Road Work
The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied crushing load. The test consists of subjecting the specimen of aggregate in standard mould to a compression test under standard load conditions (See Fig-1). Dry aggregates passing through 12.5 mm sieves and retained 10 mm sieves are filled

## Aggregate impact and - SlideShare
Applications of Aggregate Crushing Test It The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates.'" Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low. ~hus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various
