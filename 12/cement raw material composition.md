## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6 inches.

## Cement
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as

Composition of cement. Introduction Portland cement gets its strength from chemical reactions between the cement and water.  This is a fluxing agent which reduces the melting temperature of the raw materials in the kiln (from 3,000 o F to 2,600 o F). It hydrates rapidly, but does not contribute much to strength of the cement paste.

Raw materials Composition. Portland cement consists essentially of compounds of lime (calcium oxide, CaO) mixed with silica (silicon dioxide, SiO 2) and alumina (aluminum oxide, Al 2 O 3). The lime is obtained from a calcareous (lime-containing) raw material, and the other oxides are derived from an argillaceous (clayey) material.

The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

## White Cement
It is readily available throughout North America. The color of white cement is determined by its raw materials and the manufacturing process. Metal oxides, primarily iron and manganese, influence the whiteness and undertone of the material. After adding pigments, white cements produce clean, bright colors, especially for light pastels.

cement, in general, adhesive substances of all kinds, but, in a narrower sense, the binding materials used in building and civil engineering construction. Cements of this kind are finely ground powders that, when mixed with water, set to a hard mass.

The heat of hydration depends upon the chemical composition of the cement. For ordinary portland cement, the heat of hydration is of the order of 120 cal/gm or 500 joule's gram.  Raw materials for cement production are limestone, sand or clay, bauxite, and iron ore, and may include sheets, chalk, marl, shale, clay also blast furnace slag.
