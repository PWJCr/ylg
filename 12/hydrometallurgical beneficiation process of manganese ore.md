Manganese is primarily mined and extracted from Australia, Brazil, China, Gabon, and South Africa. This paper presents the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical flowsheet development to process a manganese carbonate and silicate ore. The ore was successfully upgraded via flotation, which produce a pre-concentrate grade of 17.3% Mn with 64% recovery.

## WOA1 - Manganese ore beneficiation process - Google
A process for the beneficiation of Manganese ore which includes the step of leaching of the ore with acid to remove Calcium Carbonate and Magnesium Carbonate. The ore is first broken down to the required particle size by conventional means. Selective leaching of Calcium oxide and Magnesium carbonate occurs leaving an ore having a higher Manganese content.
