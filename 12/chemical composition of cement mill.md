A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

## chemical composition of cement mill
Dec 17, 2015 The calcination process between well-proportioned argillaceous and calcareous substances leads to the production of clinker. Portland cement is obtained when the produced clinker is mixed together with a predefined ratio of gypsum and milled together in a ball mill. The chemical composition of Portland cement involves both major and minor oxides .
