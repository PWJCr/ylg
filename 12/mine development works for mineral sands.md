## Iluka Website - Wimmera
The Wimmera project involves the mining and beneficiation of a fine grained heavy mineral sands ore body in the Victorian Murray Basin for the potential long term supply of zircon and rare earths. One characteristic shared by the fine grained mineral sands deposits located in Western Victoria is higher levels of impurities in their zircon.

## Mineral Sands | Strandline Resources Limited
Heavy mineral sands (HMS) deposits comprising unconsolidated sand in an area where the water table can be managed, are often suited to dry mining with heavy earth moving equipment. Dry mining also allows greater flexibility around basement irregularities and is suitable for higher slimes deposits. With dry mining the ore is typically deposited
