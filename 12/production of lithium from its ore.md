## Where Does Lithium Come From? | Dragonfly Energy
Some call the salt deserts in Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia the "Lithium Triangle" because they hold over 50% of the world's lithium supply. However, Australia is the leader in production, supplying around 60% of the world's lithium. China is also one of the world's top producers of the element and is also the world's leading consumer.

Due to its high lithium content, spodumene is considered the most important lithium ore mineral. A typical run of mine ore can contain 1-2% Li 2 O, while a typical spodumene concentrate suitable for lithium carbonate production contains 6-7% Li 2 O (75% - 87% spodumene). Higher grade concentrates with 7.6% Li 2 O and low iron content are.

The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.

## The impact of lithium mining on the environment, what's behind clean 
Lithium is the most commonly used metal for new energy applications in the world. In the global electric vehicle industry, lithium batteries are widely used. Although the lithium battery as a new energy has a significant development status. But it has to be mentioned that many people remain concerned about the impact of lithium resource mining on the environment.

## Commercial Lithium Production and Mining of Lithium - ThoughtCo
By. Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.

## Lithium Production Processes - ScienceDirect
1. Introduction. The production of lithium has increased rapidly over recent years due to its high demand in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) used for portable electronic devices, electric tools, electric vehicles, and grid storage applications. 1 Lithium and its chemicals have been produced on an industrial scale around the world using brines and ores as principal feedstock.

##  Understanding the Basics of Lithium Extraction
While accounting for a relatively small share of the world's lithium production, mineral ore deposits yield nearly 20 tons of lithium annually. Well over 100 different minerals contain some amount of lithium, however, only five are actively mined for lithium production. These include spodumeneâwhich is the most common by farâas

## Lithium Ore - Spodumene - Alpha Thermal Process
Due to its high lithium content, spodumene is considered the most important lithium ore mineral. A typical run of mine ore can contain 1-2% Li2O, while a typical spodumene concentrate suitable for lithium carbonate production contains 6-7% Li2O (75% - 87% spodumene).
