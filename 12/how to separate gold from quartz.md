We want pure gold, but gold-bearing rocks include lots of other materials such as quartz, calcite and the sulfides of other metals. We need to separate the gold from everything else in the rock so the rock needs to be treated in some way. In New Zealand we chiselled some rocks from an outcrop near a small creek.

How do you extract gold from quartz Answers. To extract the metal from the gold- bearing quartz rock, a determination is made as to the average grain size of the gold. Often these grains are microscopic, and are not discernible by eye. Once a size is determined, the ore is milled down to that size, to "free" the gold.
