## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Stone Dust Doesn't Belong Under Pavers. Here's Why.
In contrast to stone dust, concrete sand provides superior performance over time. It doesn't eat away at pavers, it affords excellent drainage, and it compacts well.

## What is Stone Dust and Why Would You Get It? - Nimvo
Stone dust is a byproduct of crushing stone. Although it was originally a waste product, it is now used for agricultural and hardscaping purposes. Most commonly, stone dust is used for paving projects such as driveways, patios, and pathways. There are different types of stone dust available, in terms of both the stone from which it originates

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.

## Concrete Mix Design Using Crusher Dust
Concrete cubes of 150mm x 150mm x 150mm were casted with different ratios of sand to quarry dust. Sand was replaced by quarry dust in the proportions of 25 50 75 amp; 100 in concrete amp; cubes were casted using this concrete containing quarry dust.

## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine Aggregate in Concrete
For 40% quarry dust concrete workability is 0.93 and for 50% replacement of quarry dust concrete 0.87 compacting factor was observed. (d) The compressive strength results of quarry dust concrete (cubes) were obtained in the fourth series, where M20, M30, and M40 grades of concrete with 20, 30, and 40 percent replacement of quarry dust with
