Tin mining in Perak around 1910. Tin mining is one of the earliest type of mining operated in Malaysia, starting in the 1820s in Perak and in 1824 in Selangor. [1] The development of mining industries in Malaysia attracted many Chinese immigrants who came to the state in 18th and 19th centuries to work and develop the mine fields. [2]

## The Geology of Coal - KET Education
The Geology of Coal In this video, a geologist describes how coal, a sedimentary rock, was formed when organic materials piled up in swamps millions of years ago. Over time, heat and pressure transformed the buried materials into peat and into various forms of coal. The geologist shows samples of low- and high-sulfur coal.

It is formed from plant remains that have been compacted, hardened, chemically altered, and metamorphosed by heat and pressure over geologic time. Coal is found all over the world—including the United States—predominantly in places where prehistoric forests and marshes existed before being buried and compressed over millions of years.

New Zealand coals are mainly 25 to 70 million years old - relatively young compared to many overseas coal deposits. This is due to the highly active geology of New Zealand. Peat deposits have been buried relatively quickly to suitable depths for 'coalification', followed by uplift and erosion that makes them accessible for mining. Read

##  The Geology of Coal in Zimbabwe & Technologies for Its Cost  - Saimm
COAL IN GENERAL Coal is readily combustible sedimentary rock which was formed from remains of vegetative matter through the process known as coalification. The process was preceded by compaction of the plant remains within the swamp. With time the swamp floor subsided creating a high energy environment which led to ingress of sediments that buried the vegetative matter.

Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.
