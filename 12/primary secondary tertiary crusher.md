## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing?
The degree to which material is reduced through stages of primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing can depend on the type of material, like aggregate, concrete, and asphalt, and can also depend on the variety of output sizes needing produced.

## Primary and secondary crushers - Welding Alloys
Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.

The primary coal crushers may be of different types such as: (1) coal jaw, (2) coal hammer, and (3) ring granulator. Secondary coal crusher: Used when the coal coming from the supplier is large enough to be handled by a single crusher. The primary crusher converts the feed size to one that is acceptable to the secondary crusher.
