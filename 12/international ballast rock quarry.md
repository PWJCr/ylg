## About us | Mountsorrel Quarry - Tarmac
The ballast is made using the rock we extract from the quarry, which is crushed and sized to the required measurements. We then transport the stone from our railhead at Barrow-upon-Soar to Network Rail depots up and down the country. Our supply of rail ballast equates to around 70 per cent of Network Rail's total demand.
