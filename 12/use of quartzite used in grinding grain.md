## Theoretical modeling and experimental analysis of single-grain 
The fused quartz glass with diameter and thickness of 50 and 1 mm, respectively, was used in the experiment. Prior to single-grain scratching, the sample surfaces were repeatedly polished to an inclined plane with a slope of 0.0004 to achieve a change in the scratching depth during the scratching experiment by controlling the fixed scratching
