 Separation of fluorite and quartz Fatty acid is used as a collecting agent to collect fluorite, and water glass is used as an inhibitor to inhibit quartz. When the amount of water glass is small, the effect of inhibiting quartz is poor, but fluorite can be activated in flotation.

Separation of fluorite (fluorspar) and quartz. The fatty acid collects fluorite, and sodium silicate restrains quartz. The dosage of sodium silicate should be controlled properly; a small amount has activation to the fluorite (fluorspar), but inhibition function is not enough; excessive inhibits fluorite .

Fluorite is the principal mineral of fluorine and usually coexists with quartz in deposits. The removal of fine quartz in fluorite concentrate is the main problem in fluorite flotation. In this study, the flotation tests on fluorite, quartz and a weight equivalent mixture (all less than 10 μm) using water glass (with different modulus) as depressants and sodium oleate as collector were conducted.
