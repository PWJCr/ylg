## greenhouse effect | Definition, Diagram, Causes, & Facts
greenhouse effect, a warming of Earth's surface and troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) caused by the presence of water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and certain other gases in the air. Of those gases, known as greenhouse gases, water vapour has the largest effect. The origins of the term greenhouse effect are unclear. French mathematician Joseph Fourier is sometimes given

Global Warming. Global warming is by far the greatest disadvantage of the greenhouse effect. A rise in the level of the greenhouse temperature directly contributes to the rising temperature of the planet. As the greenhouse gases tend to increase, their ability to trap the heat and radiate it back to the earth's surface also increases.

## What Is the Greenhouse Effect? | NASA Climate Kids
A greenhouse captures heat from the Sun during the day. Its glass walls trap the Sun's heat, which keeps plants inside the greenhouse warm — even on cold nights. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. The greenhouse effect works much the same way on Earth. Gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat similar to the glass roof of a greenhouse.

## Effects of lime application on nitrogen and phosphorus availability in 
This study was to determine effects of liming on N and P mineralization in humic soils. Lime was applied to reduce acid saturation to 20% of the 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths of soils from Eston

## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement, better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement. As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete, this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash. The cement might have a reduced water demand, and the coarser cement gradation
