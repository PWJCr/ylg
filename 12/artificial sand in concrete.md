## Properties of Concrete by Replacement of Natural Sand with Artificial Sand
The use of artificial sand will conserve the natural resources for sustainable development of the concrete in construction industry [3]. Artificial sand is a process controlled crushed fine aggregate produced from quarried stone by crushing or grinding and classification to obtain a controlled gradation product that completely passes the 4.75mm

Mar 21, 2022How to Lay Artificial Grass On Concrete 1. Surface Preparation. To achieve an excellent artificial grass covering, you should ensure that the turf has a cordial bond with the concrete surface. If there is sand debris, the grass will crease and fold after being laid. To avoid this, you should brush or power wash and leave it to dry.

## Why spread sand on artificial grass?
The sand provides stability and protects the turf. As a result, no wrinkles or folds develop through use. The sand also surrounds the long blades of artificial grass and ensures that they remain erect. An additional benefit of filling with sand is that it helps make the grass more fire resistant, for example in case the barbecue is knocked over

## The Pro's and Con's of Artificial reefs | RUSHKULT
An artificial reef is a human made structure that is built with the specific aim of promoting the marine life of an area. Some artificial reefs were purposely built such as reef balls made from concrete or PVC whilst others are manmade items that have been sunk on purpose such as wrecks or construction debris.. Regardless of how they are built artificial reefs generally provide hard surfaces

## Installing an Artificial Lawn on Concrete
The first step in the entire process is to prepare the concrete on which you plan to lay the artificial lawn. Using the self-leveling compound, fill in all the small cracks and uneven surfaces. Clean the concrete surface thoroughly, so that the adhesive for the artificial grass will bond properly with the concrete.

Concrete is an artificial stone resulting from hardening of rationally chosen mixture of binding material, water and aggregate (Sand and crushed stone or gravel). The mixture of these materials, before it hardens, is called concrete mix. Particles of sand and crushed stone from a stone are carcass in concrete.

## On early Mechanical Properties of Artificial Sand Concrete
This paper studies the early mechanical properties of artificial sand concrete, we found by comparison with natural sand concrete that the slump of artificial sand concrete were increased by 85%, and the strength 0f 16h and 1d and3d were increased by 23.4% and 20% and 11%. Therefore, artificial sand can significantly improve the workability of concrete mix, improve the early strength of concrete.
