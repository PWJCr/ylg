## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.

## Understanding Iron Ores and Mining of Iron Ore - IspatGuru
Mining (extraction), beneficiation, and processing of iron ore produces iron and steel. Mining is defined as removing ore material from a deposit and encompasses all activities prior to beneficiation. High grade iron ores (iron content greater than 62 %) are simply crushed, screened and shipped directly to the iron making unit (e.g. blast
