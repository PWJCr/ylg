## Dolomite - Minerals Education Coalition
Description. Dolomite is a calcium magnesium carbonate mineral which has many characteristics similar to calcite. In places where access to limestone is not available or more costly, dolomites are used in its place for the basic materials from which most building stone and a significant percentage of crushed stone are produced.

Half-burned dolomite (CaCOs MgO) is used in some treatment plants as a closely graded granular filter medium to raise the pH of water without the risk of over-dosing. [Pg.314] As the particles of half-burned dolomite react, they become finer, and reduce the porosity of the bed. It then becomes necessary to back-wash the bed to remove the finest
