## What is the exact difference between manufactured sand (M-sand) and 
Manufacturing of sand involves three stages, crushing of stones into aggregates by VSI, which is fed into a rotopactor to crush aggregate into sand in required grain sizes. Screening is done to eliminate dust particles and washing of sand eliminates very fine particles present within.

Another critical issue with manufactured sand besides the fact that the process creates a sand that is dusty, is the concern over getting it in your child's eyes. Because the machines crush the rock, the process also creates angular grain shapes which have sharp or pointy edges. Getting those grains (as opposed to sand grains made rounded

## Manufactured sand - a solution to the global sand shortage?
Nov 30, 2020The use of manufactured sand makes sense from various perspectives. First, manufactured sand is more uniform in structure compared with natural sand. It also has an advantage when it comes to concrete production, because manufactured sand is less needed in the concrete mix by a margin of 5 to 20% compared with natural sand to fill the voids

The choice of fine aggregate, whether it is manufactured or natural sand, can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability, pumpability, and finishability. Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical.

## Manufactured Sand for Construction - Structural Guide
Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is used as a substitution to the river sand in construction. River sand is becoming a decaying resource in some parts of the year due to the lack of rains to collect the sand on the river beds.

The Civil engineers, Architects, Builders, and Contractors agree that the river sand, which is available today, is deficient in many respect. It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.
