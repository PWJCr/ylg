What is Green Concrete? Concrete which is made from concrete wastes that are eco-friendly are called as "Green concrete".. Green Concrete is a term given to a concrete that has had extra steps taken in the mix design and placement to insure a sustainable structure and a long life cycle with a low maintenance surface. e.g. Energy saving, CO2 emissions, wastewater.

## Green Concrete - 7 {Materials use in this concrete} - Civil Click
Green concrete has the following advantages. It reduces the effect of shrinkage and creep. It uses reused or recycled material in concrete. Flexural and compressive strength is equal to conventional concrete. Its mix design is easier for handling. It requires less repair and maintenance. Reduces the dead weight of the structure.

Green concrete is a type of concrete which resembles the conventional concrete but the production or usage of such concrete requires minimum amount of energy and causes least harm to the environment. The CO2 emission related to concrete production, inclusive of cement production, is between 0.1 and 0.2 t per tonne of produced concrete.
