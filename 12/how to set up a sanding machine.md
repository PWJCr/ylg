Wood sanding helps to smooth the wood's surface. It can also emphasise the beauty of the wood's natural grain. In addition to wood sanding, sanding tools can remove rust from metal and polish fibreglass. Finally, sanding prepares the surface for painting - it ensures paint (or varnish) goes on smooth and looks the best it can.
