Introduction. Rotating machinery or turbomachinery is a machine with a rotating component that transfers energy to a fluid or vice versa. Consequently, in a turbomachine there is energy transfer between the fluid and the rotor through dynamic interaction. Generally, if the energy transfer is from the rotor to the fluid, it is either a pump or fan.

beam movement Spontaneous emission: The laser resonator contains an active laser medium (e.g., CO 2, Nd:YAG, etc.), the electrons of which are stimulated by an external energy source, such as a flash lamp or electrical arc. As the medium receives and absorbs energy, its atoms experience a process known as spontaneous emission.

## Towards understanding the machining mechanism of the atomic force 
An AFM-based nanomilling set-up was used to conduct all machining operations. The set-up consisted of a commercial AFM system (Dimension Icon, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), a piezoelectric actuator (P-122.01, PI, Germany), and a manual rotation stage (Ksp-606 M, SIGMAKOKI, Japan) (Fig. 1(a)).The maximum travel distances of the piezoelectric actuator in both the x and y directions were 1 μm.
