## Sand Calculator - How much sand do you need in tons / tonnes or cubic 
How much is a ton of sand? A ton of sand is typically about 0.750 cubic yards (3/4 cu yd), or 20 cubic feet. Sand is assumed relatively damp, since adding water can increase or decrease the density of the sand considerably (e.g. if it was raining or if you dig up and leave sand under the sun so water evaporates).

## Convert Cubic yards to Metric tons (or tonnes) (yd³ to t Conversion)
We know that 1 yd³ = 0. t . So, to convert 50 yd³ to t, multiply 50 yd³ by 0. t. Therefore, 50 cubic yards converted to metric tons (or tonnes) is equal to 37. t. Convert 125 yd³ to t. Therefore, 125 yd³ converted to t is equal to 94. t.
