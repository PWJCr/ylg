## Rice husk properties pdfl-mexicano
This paper investigates the properties of rice husk ash (RHA) produced by using a ferro-cement furnace. The effect of grinding on the particle size and the surface area was first investigated, then the XRD analysis was conducted to verify the presence of amorphous silica in the ash. Furthermore, the effect of RHA average particle size and percentage on concrete.

## Properties Of Quarry Dust
Properties of cold bonded quarry dust coarse aggregates. The physical properties of quarry dust are given in Table 2. The specific gravity of the quarry dust is 2.74 and artificial aggregate made using quarry dust is therefore expected to fall under the category of normal weight aggregates.

And, fresh concrete mix of quarry dust concrete showed lower workability than river sand concrete for 1:2:4 mix ratio and water-cement ratio of 0.55. The higher slump interposed for quarry dust may be due to higher sand content in quarry dust.
