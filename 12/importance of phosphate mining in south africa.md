## Mining in South Africa - ProjectsIQ
The Venetia Mine is South Africa's largest producer of diamonds. South Africa is the world's fourth largest producer of diamonds, with production around 8.15 Mct of diamonds annually - 7.79 Mct of which continue to be derived from kimberlite. Smaller marine mining operations yield approximately 27 302 ct per year.
