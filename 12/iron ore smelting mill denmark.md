## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

The iron ore shown to the right was excavated from Skógar, a Viking-age iron-making site in Iceland. The larger piece is about 2cm (less than 1in) in the long dimension. Sometime about 1000 years ago, someone gathered this iron ore, processed it, transported it to the iron smelting site, but for unknown reasons, never used it in a smelt.
