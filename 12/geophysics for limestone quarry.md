The fieldwork was carried out in September 1996. 1.2 A shallow (c. 0.30 m) depth of topsoil overlies (Middle Jurassic) limestone brash and bedrock. The ground lies between 30 and 40 m OD, sloping northwards towards a dry valley running on a southwest-northeast trend close to the northern boundary (just south of Church Row Plantation).

## Geophysical characterization using advanced data processing 
Algorithmic techniques for imaging x rays passed through the body can be applied to this problem, resulting in color-coded pictures of the geophysical structure which can imply the geologic structure. High-frequency electromagnetic probing has proved successful in several experiments. Low-frequency probing has also proved feasible.

In the pilot study, the geometry and spatial extent of the Socerb thrust-fault, which separates limestone above from flysch below, were investigated using a 50 MHz antenna in the Črnotiče quarry. After one part of the quarry was deepened and

ABSTRACT Electromagnetic signals from distant radio transmitters in the frequency range 15-250 kHz were measured to model an electrical resistivity structure beneath 7 profiles in the vicinity of the Karinu limestone quarry in Estonia with the aim to map the extent of the economically exploitable limestone. The resistivity models from a 2D inversion of determinant resistivity and phase
