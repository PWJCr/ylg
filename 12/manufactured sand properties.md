## The Use of Manufactured Sand (M Sand) In Construction
Oct 6, 2021Here are the main properties of manufactured sand: • The shape of this artificial sand is cube-like or angular. • It has a rough texture. Thus, it is preferred for making concrete. • The water absorption capacity of manufactured sand is 2% to 4%. • As it is artificially produced, there are no oversized particles.

No, unfortunately Sea-Doo doesn't currently make jet boats . Until 2012, Sea-Doo manufactured several popular boats like the Speedster, Sportster, and the Challenger. These amazing jet boats offered 155- 430 horsepower depending on the model! But to the great regret of the fans, Sea-Doo boats are no longer in production.
