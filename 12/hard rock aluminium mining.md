Andy Charsley, a Principal Mining Engineer at Vale, says this trial is the largest hard-rock cutting trial Vale has ever committed to. Through more than 10 years of research and development, Komatsu says it has determined how to break rock continuously and precisely through a fully electric system that outputs zero emissions.

## What are the main methods of mining? - American Geosciences Institute
PDF version. There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river

Bauxite consists of 45-60% aluminum oxide, along with various impurities such as sand, iron, and other metals. Although some bauxite deposits are hard rock, most consist of relatively soft dirt that is easily dug from open-pit mines. Australia produces more than one-third of the world's supply of bauxite.

Block caving is an underground hard rock mining technique and mass-mining method where an ore body is undercut and allowed to collapse. In this way, it's similar to open-pit mining. Block caving involves drilling shafts below the deposit, followed by horizontal haulage tunnels and raises. Blasting is then used to create an artificial cavern

Aluminum exists in nature in various compounds. To take advantage of its properties, it must be separated from the other elements that combine with it -- a long, complex process that starts with a rock-hard material known as bauxite. After it undergoes that process, aluminum is very soft and lightweight in its pure form.
